Confusion over gestational diabetes Covid advice,"Some pregnant women who have had gestational diabetes say a change to shielding advice in England has caused confusion. Some have been told to stay at home while others have not, based on a new algorithm which calculates an individual's risk from Covid. It identified an extra 1.7 million people as extremely clinically vulnerable in England this week. They will now be prioritised for a Covid vaccine. The risk calculator, which identified the additional shielders, is based on factors such as age, ethnicity, postcode and weight, as well as health. NHS England says not everyone with the same condition will be advised to shield but suggests people contact their GP to discuss their individual case. Gestational diabetes is high blood sugar (glucose) that develops during pregnancy because the body cannot produce enough insulin. It can happen at any stage and, if not detected, can cause problems for both mother and baby. Although it usually disappears after giving birth, women who've had it are more likely to go on to develop type 2 diabetes and should have their blood sugar levels monitored. Heather Davis Mahoney, from Hertfordshire, had gestational diabetes while carrying her second child, and was monitored closely during her third pregnancy. She has not been told to shield, but says it's worrying when others from similar backgrounds have been told they should. ""There's been an explosion of confusion. People don't know what's going on and are worried about putting themselves and their babies at risk,"" she says. Vicky, from Melton Mowbray, had gestational diabetes two years ago and at first thought her shielding letter was a hoax. She works as a supermarket store manager and has carried on throughout the pandemic. ""I rang the GP but I couldn't get an answer as to why it was [that I was on the list]. I haven't fully decided what I'm going to do,"" she told the Jeremy Vine show on BBC Radio 2. But GP Dr David Triska said just because someone has gestational diabetes or had it in the past, doesn't mean they should be shielding. ""I think the major point of confusion is that people are expecting that this is a binary 'yes' or 'no' per condition algorithm - and it is not,"" he said. ""The reason why people are getting different answers from various sources is because this is an individual risk assessment."" Anyone considered to be clinically extremely vulnerable is advised to stay at home at all times and only go out to exercise or for medical appointments. In England, the new way of calculating who is most at risk from Covid-19, called 'QCovid', has been introduced based on data gathered during the first wave of coronavirus in spring 2020. As with the previous shielding list, it looks at an individual's overall health. But it also factors in other things to work out how likely it is that someone will become seriously ill with the disease. These are: Anyone added to the list will now be made a priority when it comes to getting the Covid vaccine. Decisions about who should shield in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are taken separately. NHS Digital says the new algorithm takes a careful approach. It says anyone with a current or previous history of gestational diabetes is more likely to develop type 2 diabetes or have undiagnosed diabetes. When combined with other factors used by the QCovid model, it says this could mean people are more likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19. But anyone who has been told to shield or feels they should be, should contact their GP for advice. Diabetes UK's policy manager, Nikki Joule, says: ""We know the UK government is taking a precautionary approach as to who should be added to the clinically extremely vulnerable list in England, and we expect the process will be reviewed and refined over time,"" she said. ""We understand there's confusion over this situation, but we encourage anyone who has received a letter or text unexpectedly not to panic."" Who is on the shielding list now?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56130317,1
Ambulance delays led to 'secondary Covid victims',"By Noel Titheradge & Dr Faye KirklandBBC News Ambulances waiting outside busy hospitals over Christmas led to ""secondary Covid victims"", the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has said. Information requests show that the number of hours ambulances spent waiting to offload patients rose by 63% in London and 48% in the West Midlands. BBC News has spoken to the wife of a man who died of a stroke, having waited three hours for an ambulance. The NHS said capacity had been freed up despite increasing Covid-19 infections. NHS England said the number of individual ambulances waiting more than 30 minutes across the whole of England from the end of December to the beginning of February, had fallen.  A spokesperson said: ""Despite seeing a significant increase in the number of patients with coronavirus at the end of December, the NHS has worked together to free up capacity and enable quicker patient handovers."" Rose Rwagasore was working as a nurse treating coronavirus at North Middlesex Hospital in north London on New Year's Eve, when her teenage children called her late in the evening to say their father, Robert Wabwire, was unwell, with a sudden headache and vomiting. Despite calling 999, no ambulance had arrived. Increasingly concerned, Rose spoke to her husband on the phone and recognised his speech was slurred, a common warning sign of a stroke. Rose drove home but her husband deteriorated further, and she performed CPR. ""It is literally five minutes to the hospital"", she says. ""But because now he could not move, we couldn't get him in the car."" The first of three ambulances arrived more than three hours after the initial call. The family had rung 999 four times.  The desired response time for patients with symptoms of a stroke is 18 minutes. Robert, 48 years old, had died by the time paramedics arrived. Rose says she feels his death could have been prevented. ""I can't really expect that an ambulance can take such a long time,"" she said.  ""The children were alone in the house with their father who was unwell."" Ambulance Trusts record handover times if the wait outside hospital exceeds 30 minutes. BBC News has learned that ambulances outside Robert's local hospital, North Middlesex, spent, on average, double the time waiting during the week he died, compared with the equivalent week the year before. In the week Robert died the wait was 197.8 hours. For the corresponding week in 2019 it was 94.1 hours. In London overall, ambulances waited for 4,164 hours in the two weeks spanning Christmas and New Year - a 63% increase on the 2,550 hours for the same time period in 2019.  In the West Midlands, there was a 48% increase on last year - 3,954 hours for the fortnight from 28 December 2020, compared to 2,673 hours for the same time period in 2019.  In other parts of England, waiting times showed an improvement on the previous year. Richard Webber, from the College of Paramedics, said handover delays meant patients calling 999 may have to wait longer.  BBC News has learned of other serious incidents in December and January:  Royal College of Emergency Medicine vice-president Adrian Boyle said:  ""All that's happened is Covid has taken a very fragile system and basically pushed it over the edge. ""The idea that there are patients who have called for help [and] a paramedic has made a judgement that this is a person who is seriously ill, and they get to the hospital and the whole system that's designed to help them is unable to help them...I think that's absolutely ghastly.""  The London Ambulance Service said December 2020 was its busiest ever month, and it responded to more emergency calls than during the peak of the first pandemic wave. West Midlands Ambulance Service said it had ""substantially increased the number of staff available to respond to patients"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 has put the NHS under acute pressure and our heroic paramedics, nurses and doctors have been doing everything possible to ensure hospitals continue to provide vital services and quality healthcare. ""We recognise the unique challenges facing the NHS and we continue to make sure our health service has the capacity and resources - both financial and practical - it needs to continue to weather the Covid storm."" Ambulance wait times in England 'off the scale'",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56090176,1
What Europeans have learned from a year of Covid,"By Paul KirbyBBC News From the first case diagnosed a year ago at a hospital in northern Italy to the empty shops, restaurants and stadiums of Europe's cities, the lives of Europeans have been changed forever. Curbs on movement have forced every country and society to adapt its rules and rethink its culture. There have been hard truths and unexpected innovations in a year that changed Europe. Spain's lockdown was among the harshest in Europe, says Nekane Balluerka Lasa, professor of behavioural sciences methodology at the University of the Basque Country. Isolation was particularly hard for older people and lower-income families, especially if there was no nuclear unit. Spaniards are used to social interaction. Infections came down, but the economic cost was very high and the main lesson was the impact on people's mental health. Maybe that explains why it wasn't possible to keep it going. Our study found that 46% of people felt grave psychological distress.  Italians were initially frightened into uncharacteristic obedience, says BBC Rome correspondent Mark Lowen. They were the first to be crushed by the virus, the first to see intensive care units close to collapse, and friends and family dying. Very widespread respect for restrictions began to change with the second wave, with some protests against renewed lockdowns, given the fear and fatigue.  The Dutch didn't have a lockdown until December, but when a curfew was imposed in January, riots broke out, says BBC Hague correspondent Anna Holligan. Tensions had been festering. The unrest exposed an undercurrent of resentment across generations and came after a childcare allowance scandal had brought down the government. Most accepted the lockdown, but those already frustrated felt emboldened after the government had broken its own rules. Germany's initial strategy was to test widely and then track and interrupt chains of infection, says BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill. It worked until cases spiralled last autumn. The vast majority of Germans support lockdown measures, surveys suggest. But there has been furious resistance from some, who have protested, usually without masks or social distancing. Some are simply concerned by the impact of lockdown restrictions, but the protests tend to bring together conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers and far-right activists.  Slovenia has endured some of the tightest restrictions in Europe, and yet it has one of the world's highest death rates, says BBC Balkans correspondent Guy Delauney. Internal travel was banned from October until mid-February, most shops were shut and schools went online. Epidemiologists are baffled, but people here suspect that private socialising continued despite the emergency measures. Sweden avoided a lockdown and built its strategy largely around voluntary social distancing guidelines, says BBC reporter Maddy Savage in Stockholm. The public largely complied at the start but, as cases spiked during the second wave, compliance got slacker. Tighter guidelines came in on alcohol sales and customers in bars and restaurants. But it wasn't until the turn of the year that a new pandemic law gave ministers greater powers to limit numbers in shops and on long-distance trains and buses.  The pandemic inspired a new-found, national respect for German scientists, says the BBC's Jenny Hill. Virologist Christian Drosten is now a household name, as is Lothar Wieler, who runs the Robert Koch Institute that advises the German government. So are the married BioNTech founders UÄur Åahin and Ãzlem TÃ¼reci, who developed the first approved vaccine. Chancellor Angela Merkel, who studied quantum chemistry herself, is heavily influenced by the opinion of Germany's scientific community which, in the main, urges restrictions and caution. But the response to the pandemic has increasingly been characterised by squabbles among regional leaders, some of whom demand fewer restrictions on daily life.   Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has largely been the public face of the country's response to the pandemic, says Maddy Savage in Stockholm. Previously a low-profile bureaucrat, he quickly became a well-known and polarising figure both at home and abroad. Early on in the pandemic polls suggested 75% of the population backed the public health response. But that dropped to 50% as cases rose and tougher restrictions came in. His face appeared on T-shirts, while critics sent his family death threats.  Internationally, scientific advisers were called in but no-one thought to ask the experts on old age, says Ingmar Skoog, head of the Centre of Ageing and Health in Sweden. Half of all deaths in Sweden's first wave were in care institutions and another quarter had home care. It's very difficult to stop the virus coming into care homes as most people need a lot of help, but we didn't have enough protective gear. Most often it's not relatives who bring the virus into care homes; for six months we had a no-visit rule. So you had an 83-year-old man not allowed to visit his wife of 60 years. It's been suggested that may have been illegal. Italy has picked experts for key jobs in the new government, says Mark Lowen in Rome. Initially ex-Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had very high approval ratings, but old political divisions surfaced over how to manage the second lockdown and rebuild the economy. He fell and now technocrat Mario Draghi, ex-head of the European Central Bank, is in charge with experts running finance and education and a new ministry for ecological transition. There's a feeling opportunities to transform Italy had to be given to figures transcending political divisions. While Serbia has had spectacular success with its vaccination programme, neighbouring Bosnia has suffered, says Guy Delauney. Bosnia has no strong, centralised leadership and tackling coronavirus has largely fallen to the two semi-autonomous regions, which have not covered themselves in glory. The prime minister of the Federation entity, Fadil Novalic, is due to stand trial over the award of a contract to procure ventilators to a fruit-processing company. And Bosnian health workers are more likely to get vaccinated in Serbia, where border centres have offered them a jab. The European Union was not well prepared, although it's far from unique in that, says BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly. It did what it could to co-ordinate action - by creating ""green lanes"" at closed or crowded borders, to facilitate the flow of medical supplies. But it couldn't do much about the way individual states competed for PPE. Rich countries like France did much better than poorer ones like Bulgaria.  There was local co-operation when health systems were overwhelmed: patients were moved over the French border to hospitals in Germany; and recently Portugal received help from Germany and Austria. But it's perfectly possible such aid could have happened if the EU had not existed. The European Commission's really important attempt to ensure its own centrality in European life has been to take over the vaccine procurement programme from EU member states. This is a field in which it has no experience and it has not, so far, done well. A failure on vaccine procurement and rollout would create a major political problem. Hungary's birthrate has fallen, says BBC Budapest correspondent Nick Thorpe. Three thousand more babies were born in 2020 than in 2019, largely because of the conservative Fidesz government's generous tax incentives to couples to have more babies. But birth numbers began to fall in November and then fell further in December and January - the first months when a Covid impact could be registered. Government supporters draw comfort from the fact that the marriage rate continues to rise and abortion rates have plunged. Spanish women have had it tougher, says Prof Nekane Balluerka Lasa. Several studies have shown that in families where both men and women work outside the home, women spend much more time caring for dependent elderly people and for their children. This may explain why the psychological discomfort of women during the pandemic was greater than that of men. Ageism in Sweden has increased, says Prof Ingmar Skoog. There are 1.5m people in Sweden over 70 and the authorities went out and said they couldn't take care of themselves. But older people are completely different from 30 or 40 years ago: we talk about 70 as the new 50. Those who did not have carers only accounted for 10% of deaths. Italy's long-entrenched brain drain has partially reversed, says Mark Lowen. More than five million Italians live abroad, up by more than 75% in the past 15 years, with the largest rises among high school and university graduates. While successive governments have tried to tempt them back, it's the pandemic that seems to have had a bigger impact in persuading Italians to return, to be with their families. The challenge now will be to keep them here. Kevin Connolly, Brussels: The concept of open borders is deeply ingrained in the theology of the European Union: the idea that a journey from Paris to Gdansk should be little different from a trip to Grenoble. But open borders don't work during pandemics. There was alarm in Brussels when some member states closed borders at the start of the pandemic, and then again when Germany imposed border controls with the Czech Republic and part of Austria this month. But business and leisure travel have fallen so much that the issue has not mattered so much. Bethany Bell, BBC Vienna correspondent: One of the most notorious Covid outbreaks began last year at the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl, spreading to dozens of countries when foreign tourists went home. This year the ski slopes are open, but with quarantines, and hotels and restaurants closed, skiing is effectively only meant for locals. Police have fined dozens of foreign skiers who dodged the rules. Imogen Foulkes, BBC Bern correspondent: Switzerland's alpine communities are also heavily dependent on winter tourism and the government has taken the controversial decision to keep the ski slopes open. AprÃ¨s ski parties are a distant memory, with restaurants and bars closed and lifts at reduced capacity. Economic damage is immense, but initial data suggests Switzerland's strategy may not be as risky as some critics claimed. Increased testing at resorts meant that outbreaks in Wengen and St Moritz were found and contained quickly.  Maddy Savage, Stockholm: Swedish ski resorts are open too, but skiers have been asked to stay one ski-pole apart and avoid socialising outside their group. So the aprÃ¨s ski scene is toned-down, with no alcohol sales after 20:00 and no live bands belting out Abba or Avicii songs. But travel here for non-Swedes has become harder, with negative tests required for the first time this month,. Guy Delauney, Ljubljana: Slovenians own more than 100,000 properties in neighbouring Croatia, so the offer of a â¬200 (Â£170) voucher last summer had little effect on domestic tourism. With no ""firebreak"" between the end of the summer holidays and the start of term, the suspicion is that students may have acted as vectors for transmission ahead of October's lockdown. Millions of mink were culled in Denmark when Covid-19 spread to mink farms. Carl Valentin, animal welfare spokesman for the Socialist People's Party: We have learned a lot about what diseases like Covid have to do with our relationship with animals. Everyone was talking about Wuhan and wet markets, but many Danes didn't know we had the world's biggest mink population. It's now been made illegal to farm mink this year and we'll never have a mink industry in that way again in Denmark.  Outbreaks among hundreds of workers at German meat processing plants, such as at TÃ¶nnies in GÃ¼tersloh last June, shocked Germans and led to a change in the law, says Jenny Hill. Scientists thought the workers were more vulnerable because of cool temperatures in slaughterhouses and loud machinery that forced them to shout. But there were stories of long hours, minimum wages and overcrowded accommodation for workers, mainly from Eastern Europe and employed by sub-contractors. From April, meat-processing plants will be largely banned from employing temporary workers.  France finally goes digital, by Lucy Williamson, BBC Paris correspondent. Until the second lockdown last autumn, life in France often evoked an age of typewriters and triplicate. Despite an annual turnover of almost â¬2.4tn (Â£2.1tn; $2.9tn), two-thirds of small businesses didn't operate online, and the websites of even vast iconic department stores like Galeries Lafayette or BHV offered little more than an address and opening hours, plus an image or two of some fancy shoes. Now, everything from cafe meals to tax payments and residency card applications can be made online and the department stores have slick websites. Boosting the digital economy has been a key goal for President Emmanuel Macron; the pandemic a strange ally in pushing France online. Spaniards are working from home, for now, by Prof Nekane Balluerka Lasa. Spain is a very friendly culture: we don't know any other way. While digital transformation to ""teleworking"" here has been quite big, I think it'll complement face-to-face work and won't replace it completely. University students already spend one week at home and one week at university - and they want to come every day. A cashless society? Not just yet, by Bethany Bell, BBC News Vienna: Since the pandemic began, it's become common to see signs in Austrian supermarkets asking for cashless payments to ""protect"" staff and customers. Austrians have traditionally liked paying in cash, but a survey by the Austrian National Bank last summer suggests the pandemic may have speeded up an already existing trend towards cashless payments, as with the rest of Europe. But cash is still very popular here. It's not unusual to come across cash-only cafes or shops, and there is little sign of it going out of fashion.

Prison Covid cases 'almost double' in a week,"The number of Covid cases in Scotland's prisons has almost doubled in a week, according to new figures. Official Scottish Prison Service (SPS) statistics showed the number of virus cases increased from 189 to 364. The spike has been driven by a major outbreak at HMP Kilmarnock, where 247 positive cases have now been recorded. The Scottish Human Rights Commission has renewed calls for a reduction in the prison population to help the system cope with the pandemic. The Scottish government said the wellbeing of prisoners was a priority and that outbreaks were being ""well managed"". The SPS said 731 individuals were currently self-isolating across 11 establishments. Of the total number of positive cases it noted a ""significant number"" were asymptomatic positives. The current Scottish prison population is 7,413. Outbreaks have also been reported at HMP Addiewell in West Lothian (90 cases) and HMP Dumfries (25 cases). Cases at HMP Kilmarnock increased by 52% over the past seven days, from 162 to 247. The remaining two positive cases were in separate establishments.  The SPS said in a statement: ""We continue to work closely with public health colleagues in the relevant health boards in managing these cases. ""On the recommendation of the Incident Management Teams, mobile testing units have this week been working in HMP Dumfries, HMP Kilmarnock and HMP Addiewell to support the prompt identification of cases."" Virtual visiting has also been suspended at all three prisons in a bid to reduce the spread of the virus. Some short-term prisoners nearing the end of their sentences were released early last year. Judith Robertson, chair of the Scottish Human Rights Commission, called for prisoner numbers to be further reduced. She said: ""The Commission has been urging the Scottish government to take action on prison conditions since the beginning of the pandemic.  ""The current outbreaks in parts of the prison estate underscore the need for this.  Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said it remained an ""incredibly challenging time"" for everyone in the sector but stressed ""robust operational measures remain in place"" In a letter to the Scottish Parliament justice committee, Mr Yousaf said: ""The prison service and health partners will continue to take rapid and decisive action to limit the spread of this new variant across the estate.  The Scottish government said that the safety, wellbeing and human rights of all those in Scotland's prisons remained a priority and that infection rates remained generally low. A spokesman said: ""To the credit of the multi-agency teams and measures activated, the outbreaks at HMPs Addiewell, Dumfries and Kilmarnock are being well-managed and they, as with all of Scotland's other prisons, continue to operate safely and securely. ""However, we clearly take very seriously the current pressures facing the prison service, we remain vigilant and are actively considering what further action may be required to both reduce the use of imprisonment and maintain a lower prison population."" Last month it emerged a quarter of the prison population was awaiting trial. One remand prisoner told BBC Scotland he is currently spending around 23 hours a day in his cell to stop the spread of the virus.

Taoiseach says nine more weeks of restrictions,"By Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin Correspondent Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has indicated that the highest level of restrictions could remain in place until the end of April Next week, the Irish government is expected to update its Living with Covid plan. But it seems almost certain very little will change apart from a phased return to school and construction. Mr Martin said the ""severe"" Level 5 lockdown restrictions could remain in place for another nine weeks.  In an interview with the Daily Mirror, he also suggested that pubs, restaurants and hairdressers may remain closed even after that. Mr Martin later told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that ""nothing is set in stone"". Later on Friday, it emerged that three cases of a new variant of Covid-19, first identified in Brazil, have been detected in the Republic of Ireland.  All three cases are directly associated with recent travel to Brazil. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said that those travelling from Brazil or any of the other 19 countries - that were recently designated as ""Category 2""- are required by law to quarantine at home for 14 days.  Earlier, Mr Martin told RTÃ that there would be no large scale reopening of the construction industry and that reopening would depend on the progression of the disease.  He added that there are a range of restrictions and it does not mean none will be lifted between now and May, saying it was ""open to review"". It comes as TÃ¡naiste Leo Varadkar said that schools, childcare and early childhood education programmes would reopen next month on a phased basis.  He told RTÃ's News at One, that the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) advised the government on Thursday that schools and childcare could reopen in March and after the Easter break. Mr Varadkar also said it remains ""too risky"" for construction to reopen.  Mr Martin's coalition government was roundly criticised for easing its last lockdown too early so that people could have in his words ""a meaningful Christmas"". His comments come at a time when Irish health officials are expressing concern that the fall in new Covid-19 cases is slowing down. They had hoped that the figures would be lower than they are and are blaming the more transmissible UK variant of the virus for that. There have been a total of 4,109 coronavirus-related deaths in the Republic of Ireland, according to the latest figures released on Friday, with 28 additional deaths reported.  Officials say that 90% of all cases in the Republic of Ireland are now associated with the variant first discovered in Kent. The Republic's government says the long-term suppression of the virus is now its aim. That means a continuation of the lockdown restrictions with some modifications. It also plans to introduce mandatory hotel quarantining for all those coming from 20 countries including Brazil, Austria and 18 mainly sub-Saharan African countries. In early January, 11 cases of the South African variant found and were quickly brought under control.  On Thursday night, public health officials said the current R number - the rate at which the virus reproduces - is between 0.65 and 0.85. In his newspaper interview, Mr Martin offered some hope saying the vaccine ""was the light at the end of the tunnel"" and ""will enable a better quality of life"". He said the government is looking at 1.2 million vaccine doses a month by April, May and June, with the majority of the population vaccinated by September. On Friday, following a request from Ireland's Health Service Executive (HSE), the Irish Air Corps delivered the first consignment of Covid-19 vaccines to the Aran Islands in Co Galway and the Arranmore Island in Co Donegal. Three shipments of the Moderna vaccine were handed to GP's and will be administered to the island's residents.  Meanwhile, on Friday, it was also announced that Dr Emer Holohan, the wife of Ireland's chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan, had died following a long illness.   MicheÃ¡l Martin paid tribute to Dr Holohan, saying she had ""made a significant contribution to the health service, including her work on the health strategy when I was minister for health"". Northern Ireland's Health Minister Robin Swann also paid tribute, saying: ""This is tragic news this evening and I want to send my deepest sympathies to Dr Holohan, his children Clodagh and Ronan, and the entire family circle at this terrible time.""

Four can meet for exercise in Wales from Saturday,"Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourism in time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Wales before Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - are returning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. âIt will be in that careful, step-by-step wayâFirst Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford tells #BBCBreakfast talks will begin this week about the re-opening of non-essential retail and personal services. https://t.co/Oj7SNDM25k pic.twitter.com/YuZ9xxl0Sj The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'.""   He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility.  The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March.  Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks.  He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown ""cautiously"" - a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has been extended to 1 April, while in Scotland most lockdown measures are due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown, published on Friday. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December, after a rise in cases blamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses.  ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Today, @WelshConserv want to see the First Minister outline a roadmap to recovery for people across Wales.Â From media reports this morning, we understand details will be provided on the return of more children to school, which is a welcome start. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Warning as 17 places visited by new Covid-19 cases,"People infected with Covid-19 in a new cluster emerging on the Isle of Man visited 17 places earlier this week, including a restaurant, a beauty salon and a sport club. Twelve new cases have been identified just over two weeks since the island exited its last lockdown. The cluster stems from a member of the island's ferry crew. Anyone who visited the below venues at certain times has been asked to isolate if they develop symptoms. A ""small number"" of pupils who attended Ballakermeen High School on 12 February were now self-isolating following the contact tracing process, a government spokesman said. The number 31 school bus on the day has also been identified as a relevant location he added. Five of the 12 new cases emerged earlier on Friday. Places of concern on Monday are: On Tuesday, the following places were visited: Places of concern on Wednesday were: Venues at risk on Thursday were: In addition, the Wonderland Room at the Exit Strategy games facility between 16:30 on Wednesday and 16:00 on Friday is also an area of concern. Chief Minister Howard Quayle said no new restrictions would be brought in at the present time due to the small number of positive test results and the ""absence of unexpected cases not linked to this cluster''. The Council of Ministers would continue to monitor the situation closely, he added. Director of public health Henrietta Ewart said the community ""must remain vigilant"". Anyone who does show symptoms should contact the 111 helpline to arrange to be tested. A total of 449 people have tested positive for the virus since the start of the pandemic, and 25 people have died. Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and Twitter?

Jersey 'contains outbreak' after Covid rule breach,"Seventy-nine people have been placed in isolation in Jersey after nine new cases of Covid-19 were identified. The island's government said it had contained the outbreak, although further contact tracing could identify more positive cases. Investigations have shown the cluster spread after ""a number of adults got together in each other's homes"". An event attended by a person who broke mandatory isolation after travelling is being investigated. Public Health guidelines in Jersey currently advise against visiting other people's homes and require everyone who arrives in the island to isolate until they have received a negative test after 10 days. Failure to self-isolate on arrival in Jersey is a criminal offence and carries a fine of up to Â£10,000. ""I want to thank employees across Public Health, Contact Tracing and Enforcement who have prevented a small outbreak from going any further,"" said Health Minister Richard Renouf. ""This deliberate flouting of public health advice has led to nine people testing positive so far, and 79 people having to isolate. ""We will not be able to continue our reconnection plans if this kind of behaviour becomes more prevalent,"" he added. Under current plans, pubs and restaurants in Jersey will be allowed to reopen for table service only from Monday, with up to 10 people allowed in a group, including people from different households. Ministers are still advising against household mixing because there are ""no control measures possible in private homes"".

G7 pledge billions for Covax vaccine scheme,"G7 leaders have pledged to intensify co-operation on Covid-19 and increase their contribution to the Covax vaccine-sharing initiative. In a joint statement released after a virtual summit on Friday, G7 leaders raised their overall commitment to $7.5bn (Â£5.3bn).  Wealthy countries are facing growing pressure to make sure lower-income nations get fair access to vaccines.  President Joe Biden has pledged $4bn in US aid to the fund. An initial $2bn will be donated in 2021, with an additional $2bn coming over the next two years.  Germany pledged an additional $1.2bn with Chancellor Angela Merkel telling journalists: ""I stressed in my intervention that the pandemic is not over until all people in the world have been vaccinated."" The EU also increased its commitment on Friday.  We will only be safe if the whole world is safeAs announced in the #G7, the EU is doubling its contribution to #COVAX, the worldâs facility for universal access to vaccines - from â¬500 million to â¬1 billion. Deliveries will start soon. A true moment of global solidarity. The Covax scheme  is aiming to get at least 1.3bn vaccine doses to vulnerable populations worldwide in the coming months.  Covax is co-led by Gavi, known as the Vaccine Alliance, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI). WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday he was grateful for  the new commitments but  emphasised that more was needed to address the world's vaccination imbalance.  ""Vaccine equity is not just the right thing to do, it's also the smart thing to do,"" he said at the annual Munich Security Conference, also held virtually on Friday. French President Emmanuel Macron is among world leaders calling for further action to address the world's vaccine imbalance - saying Europe and the US should urgently send up to 5% of their supplies to developing nations. The new commitments come days after UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised the distribution of vaccines so far as ""wildly uneven and unfair"". He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Friday's online meeting was the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, this year's G7 chair, has said that the UK will donate much of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer nations.  To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. Analysis by Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need.  New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, the US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses.  The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries.  But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism.  Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk.  And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries.

'Passionate' police officer dies with Covid-19,"A ""passionate"" police officer described as ""a true gentleman"" has died with Covid-19 aged 49. PC Jonathan Wain, who joined Greater Manchester Police in 2003, died on Monday, the force confirmed. The father-of-two, nicknamed The Duke after Hollywood actor John Wayne, was described as ""irreplaceable"" and ""loved"". He is the second GMP officer to die within a month after testing positive for the virus. Forty-year-old Abbasuddin Ahmed, who joined the force in 2017, died in January. PC Wain, who was based in Bury, leaves behind his partner Gaynor and two sons. The force said PC Wain was ""passionate about being a police officer and doing a good job"". ""He will be in our thoughts and hearts forever and we will try to do him proud throughout our careers"", it added. PC Keith Redmond said: ""I still remember that trademark lopsided grin and chuckle. We are all stunned that he's gone and we're all going to miss that smile."" Ch Insp Mike Brennan added: ""He was everything that a police officer should be and more, and we are proud to have called him a friend, a colleague and a brother in blue. He will be missed so terribly by all. ""Our thoughts and prayers remain with Gaynor, Jon's sons and his extended family at this incredibly sad time.""

Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules?,"Wales went into lockdown on 20 December, after a rise in cases blamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The nation's stay-at-home rules could come to an end by the second week of March, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Currently non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home as much as possible. Major changes depend on case rates continuing to fall, and it was too soon to say if people would be allowed to travel beyond their local area, Mr Drakeford said. Wales is still in a national lockdown at alert level four. From Saturday the number of people who can exercise together will increase from two to four. They must come from a maximum of two households. People, Mr Drakeford said, are still not allowed to drive to exercise and ""it does mean exercise, not socialising"". More elite athletes will be allowed to train again, although it is not clear from when. Gyms are unlikely to be allowed to reopen soon. People are still allowed out of their homes to exercise, for unlimited times and periods each day, while Wales remains in level four, but must maintain social distancing. This rule does not apply to children under the age of 11, who are able to accompany people on their exercise. The Welsh Government has previously urged people to avoid activities that involve a ""significant degree of risk"", such as water sports like wild swimming.  From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen, in line with current rules for register offices. Children aged between three and seven - those in the ""foundation phase"" - are returning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. The first minister has said there will be no ""wholesale"" reopening of non-essential shops.  But discussions are taking place about opening some businesses, like shops and hairdressers, by the middle of March. Currently only supermarkets, pharmacies and those who sell items such as food and medication are allowed to remain open, but with strict social distancing measures in place. Supermarkets are not meant to sell anything deemed ""non-essential"" during lockdown, while high street businesses selling similar items are closed, and alcohol sales after 22:00 GMT are banned. Showrooms are also closed - such as for kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales -but click and collect is still allowed. Pubs, restaurants and cafes, are still closed, apart from for takeaways. There are no imminent reopening plans for the hospitality sector, including pubs, restaurants and cafes. Mr Drakeford said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods of the next six weeks. Mr Drakeford said more care homes visits are being considered. Talks about reopening tourism for Easter are underway, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely the priority. Wales' Covid rules will be reviewed again in three weeks. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave has been ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. At 84 per 100,000 people over seven days, the country now has the lowest rate of the UK nations. England's lockdown and school closure rules will last until at least 8 March, while Scotland's decision were reviewed on 2 February. Northern Ireland has also said pupils will not return to school until 8 March at the earliest. The student experience has been very different for those studying in 2020 and 2021 so far, with campuses closed, lectures cancelled, and nights out banned for much of the year. A petition calling for the UK government to reduce university student tuition fees from Â£9,250 to Â£3,000 has gained more than 400,000 signatures online. Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start of the new term, but many students will now continue to learn online until cases fall. Cardiff University has confirmed in-person teaching will not restart as planned, and will be moved online until at least 22 February, with exemptions for medical students and practical based courses. Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separate lockdown was imposed. Wales entered alert level 4 - or ""stay at home lockdown"" to you and me - from the Sunday before Christmas, the most similar level of restrictions to the first lockdown or the firebreak in the autumn. Wales official guidance can be found here.  People are required to stay at home and only mix with their household or support bubble, while only leaving their home for ""essential reasons"". A support bubble can be formed by single adults or single parents joining another household. However, people will be allowed ""to dissolve the bubble they're in at the moment and reform it with another household, provided there's a ten day gap between the two"". The rule on who you can mix with applies both indoors and outdoors. Travelling is only allowed for essential purposes, such as for work and for caring responsibilities. International travel is also not permitted. All indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions are shut, non-essential shops have had to close along with gyms, hairdressers, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation. Ministers are also looking at what else businesses need to do to protect employees in the workplace and support home-workers. Wedding ceremonies and funerals can still take place with limited numbers, but no receptions or wakes can be held. Can I travel to a beauty spot for a walk? The quick answer is no - unless you're lucky enough to have a Pen-y-Fan, Snowdon or one of Wales' famous beaches within walking distance of your front door. You can still go.  Attending appointments for ""urgent medical issues"" is ""important,"" according to the government - and you're also allowed to leave home to see your dentist, optometrist and other health support, like mental health services. But people have been warned not to visit vaccination centres, GP surgeries, hospitals, pharmacies, dentists or their optometrist if they have Covid symptoms or are awaiting a Covid test result.

What is the controversy facing Governor Cuomo?,"In the early days of the pandemic, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was widely praised for his handling of the outbreak. He was viewed as steering his state from the worst-hit in the US to a Covid-19 success story.  In April, New York State had more Covid-19 cases than any single country outside the US, recording some 10,000 cases each day. By May, infections had begun to plummet, and Mr Cuomo was handed much of the credit.  And his near-daily press briefings held throughout were a source of comfort to many. He hammered home what he called ""fact-based"" guidelines alongside common sense lectures and family anecdotes. Now, the governor is facing harsh scrutiny for his response to the outbreaks in New York nursing homes.  Here's what's going on with Governor Cuomo.  Mr Cuomo has been governor of New York for more than a decade.  He held frequent briefings during the early phase of the pandemic, talking about the virus and how it affected his family, and helped people grapple with the health crisis.  During this time, he was given emergency powers, granting him vast authority to fight the pandemic throughout the state. In October, Mr Cuomo released a book, American Crisis, providing ""leadership lessons"" from the pandemic. The book's summary describes the governor as ""the standard-bearer of the organised response the country desperately needed"" for the coronavirus outbreak. He has been accused of holding back data about nursing home deaths.  The state attorney general released a report in January about New York's response to Covid in care homes and the handling of related data, saying it appeared a complete tally had not been provided to state lawmakers.  More than 15,000 New Yorkers in care homes have died since the start of the pandemic - believed to be the highest in the US. But - until late last month - the state's health department had logged just over 8,500 fatalities. The initial undercount was partly the result of a controversial policy to exclude residents that died outside of the care facilities, including in hospital, from the official numbers, according to a report. Recently, Mr Cuomo acknowledged ""a delay"" in the reporting of some nursing home deaths but said that the overall Covid death count has always been accurate. He said the failure to quickly answer questions from state lawmakers and the news media had created a void ""filled with scepticism, and cynicism and conspiracy theories which furthered the confusion"". Last week, in a private conversation leaked to the New York Post, a top aide to Mr Cuomo confessed to covering up the real numbers and withholding the information out of concern the data ""was going to be used against us"". Agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as officials with the US attorney's office in Brooklyn, are looking at the way that Mr Cuomo has handled nursing homes and other matters related to the pandemic, according to reports.  In addition, some Democrats in the New York state Senate are hoping to take away his emergency powers. The lawmakers are likely to vote on a measure regarding his powers next week.  It is an unusual move by members of the governor's own party, a sign of the dire political situation he now faces. Mr Cuomo became one of the nation's most influential Democrats during the early days of the pandemic.  His briefings, televised live, at times got more attention than appearances by the then-presidential candidate Joe Biden.  The controversy over the nursing-home deaths has created enormous political problems for Mr Cuomo, but he remains popular.  His poll numbers are good: 56% of those in New York rate him favourably, according to a Siena College survey, despite the recent controversy. Analysts say he is a skilled operator, and still wields immense power.  ""The storm's not over,"" says Hofstra University's Lawrence Levy. ""But as long as there are no further damaging revelations, he has the ability to weather it.""

Welsh businesses react to plan for lockdown easing,"Some businesses may be able to start reopening from March under plans revealed by Wales' first minister.  Ahead of the latest lockdown review, Mark Drakeford said talks were in place about opening parts of the tourism sector in time for Easter.  Meanwhile, he said some non-essential retailers may reopen at the end of the period of restrictions, as well as more children returning to school.  Mr Drakeford said any plans depended on the numbers of coronavirus cases.  How do those involved feel about the plans?  Jenna McDonnell has run her wedding hair and make up salon in Newport for the past six years. The 33-year-old employs seven staff and had to close when the latest lockdown began in December. She said her money was ""drying up"" and wanted Welsh Government to give her more notice about reopening so she can prepare properly. Reacting to Mr Drakeford's comments, she said: ""Loads of people have messaged me about it and I was like oh my good I might be able to reopen in three weeks.  ""It would be nice to know. I've had no information really - I'm only going on what people tell me. ""We closed on 21 December and haven't opened since. It was a long day in work and everyone in the street came running in the shop asking if I'd heard the news that we all had to close that day. I had customers ringing me asking if I could stay open until midnight but all my staff had already gone and we'd had a long day. ""Last time they sprang it on us. It's been a bit rubbish since we closed. ""I'm hoping that they'll let us work again but it's a funny one. I remember when they opened the beauty industry before they put all these measures in place like first aid training. But they only told us on the Friday before we opened on Monday. ""It was mad - I'm hoping that if they do let us reopen they give us some more notice.  ""Everything's been difficult financially which is why I'm hoping we can start back up again but they have supported us.  ""It could have been a lot worse - a lot of other European countries haven't had the support we've had."" Ed Williams, who owns a caravan park in Llansantffraid, Powys, said he was ""buzzing"" with the news.  It is home to about 100 static and touring caravans, and Mr Williams said his customers were ""desperate"" to get back.  ""Hopefully this is a silver lining to the cloud,"" he said.  ""All the caravans are privately owned, last summer was great, everyone behaved so well and I couldn't see any problems.  ""Being on the border is a bit confusing, but if we can reopen close it Easter it would be amazing."" More pupils are also set to return to school, with Mr Drakeford mooting 15 March as a date for older primary school children to return to school.  Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""We obviously want to see schools open across Wales and it now appears logical to fully reopen our primary schools and for those in secondary education who would have faced important examinations this summer to return to the classroom.  ""Our exam-age pupils in particular have suffered a difficult and distressing year of disruption and lost learning. ""We welcome the education minister's pledge that the next phase of reopening will be kept under review and will only go ahead if the science fully supports it to ensure education staff, the pupils and their parents have full confidence it is safe to return.  ""We are also pleased that the minister is giving further consideration to a rota system that would allow pupils to return in smaller numbers initially, reducing the risk of a spike in infection rates."" Rachel Antoniazzi, deputy head teacher of Thornhill Primary School in Cardiff, said she was ""a little concerned"" there would not be enough time between three to seven-year-olds returning and seven to 11-year-olds if the 15 March date was realised. She said: ""As much as I know that every parent and teacher wants to see kids back, is it enough time? ""It takes two weeks to measure impact, so is the gap long enough? I welcome it and I think we should be back but I'm concerned that it's not enough time. Sarah Bruton is the managing director of a spa in Caerphilly.  She said it would be ""absolutely brilliant"" if the business was able to reopen in mid-March, but said the spa faced lots of ""delays and caveats"" last year, which has led to caution.  Ms Bruton said: ""If that's the case that's absolutely brilliant.  ""We went down this road last year and there were some bumps in the road. Until we see the detail and a definite plan it's hard to get too excited.  ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet. Our phones are switched off for now with an answer phone message in place, once we get the go we'll open things up so we can get those bookings in.""

Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales,"By Steve DuffyBBC News What can different statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? We seem to be bombarded with different measures, but what do they mean and how does Wales compare with other parts of the UK?  Here, we try to answer some of the questions and bring in some of the key areas of data - covering case rates, hospital cases, vaccination, testing and deaths.  Case rates can tell us how many people with Covid-19 symptoms are presenting themselves for tests which then come back positive.  Public Health Wales (PHW) said although case numbers were falling, the rates in north Wales were nearly double the average and there have been small increases in other areas. ""It is encouraging to see that the numbers of people being treated for coronavirus in our hospitals is reducing, there are still a large number of people who are extremely ill, which means that the pressure on services is still very high,"" said Eleri Davies, PHW incident director. North-east Wales has been the worrying hot spot after Christmas, but rates are falling quite steadily. Around 90% of cases in the area were been identified as being the new faster-spreading UK variant. There is little between Wrexham on 112.5 cases per 100,000 and neighbouring Flintshire (121.7). Flintshire is the highest in Wales, but it is still at its lowest point since early December and the 157th highest in the UK. Wrexham and Flintshire no longer dominate the 10 highest localised rates in Wales, when they are broken down by community - or what is known as middle layer super output area (MSOAs). These local hotspots are now more widespread, although with the current low numbers are even more sensitive to local spikes - from outbreaks at a local care home, for example.  Since January, Wrexham's had the highest weekly Covid rate in WalesBut it's starting to come down... pic.twitter.com/mNnfKk6eFQ None of these areas are above 350 cases per 100,000. Just over a month ago, there were more than a dozen over 1,000 cases per 100,000. There are also now around 70 communities with numbers too low to register. Anglesey's case rate has hovering between 100 and 150 cases per 100,000 and is still one of only five areas with case rates in three figures. The case rate in Bridgend peaked just before Wales was put into a pre-Christmas lockdown on 20 December. But it has fallen back sharply and is under 50 cases per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September and is in the lowest 20 local authority area in the UK on Thursday. Its positivity rate has also dropped to about 6%. It was above 35% in late December. Similar patterns can be seen in Swansea, which is now below 70 cases per 100,000. Powys - against the general trend - has risen above 100 with Welshpool being the second highest local hotspot (297.4 cases per 100,000), but it has been quite volatile. The local council has warned people to continue to follow guidelines after a ""sharp rise"". Carmarthenshire is at the lowest point since early October and Ceredigion is now under 25 cases per 100,000 - the lowest in Wales and fifth lowest in the UK.  The south Wales valleys have perhaps seen the most dramatic reductions. Merthyr Tydfil has fallen from a peak of 1,349 cases per 100,000 and the UK's highest a week before Christmas. It is back to under 60 cases per 100,000 for the first time since early September, almost to the point where this phase of testing began. There has been encouragement too in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT), where the case rate has dipped to its lowest point for more than four months. It is now hovering between 80 and 100 cases per 100,000. Pontypridd East and Cilfynydd is the highest local hot spot in Wales currently - 344.8 cases per 100,000, or 23 positive tests in the past week. Tonypandy East is also in the top 10. Vale of Glamorgan is also finally below 100 cases per 100,000 for the first time since October, as is Newport. Meanwhile, Cardiff is around the 100 mark. Caerau East and Whitchurch feature in the list of hotspots. Scientists say we need to look at the proportion of positive tests, alongside the case rates, when looking at the spread of the virus - and the road out of lockdown. The positivity rate in Wales now stands at 7.9% - its lowest point since 5 October. Flintshire (12.1%) and Powys (11.9%) are now the highest and are the only council areas not in single figures. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the positivity proportion of tests should be no more than 5% for a stable period before areas come out of restrictions.  Ceredigion (2.8%), Pembrokeshire (4.7%) are within that threshold and Denbighshire (5.1%), Merthyr Tydfil (5.2.%) and Bridgend (5.5%) are among areas close to it. Because of a lag in test results coming back, PHW publishes case rate figures going back to an earlier seven-day period, which it says makes figures more accurate.  So, we wait for those late results to come in before looking at what the picture is - a bit like in football, waiting on a Saturday evening for all the final scores to come in before looking at the league tables. The case rate is only a snapshot of the virus out there as it relies on people asking for a test - and there is a recognition that some may be reluctant due to fear of loss of income due to self-isolation. Others may have the virus and not know it, as they are asymptomatic.  But since the summer, when tests were fully available to anyone who thought they might have Covid, it has been a good measure to look at how the virus is spreading and affecting different parts of Wales. There is a fine-tuning of the testing strategy going forward, using more technology and the ability to tackle local hotspots, including more mobile testing centres. The case rate in Wales as a whole was for a period in December, one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It currently has the lowest rate of the UK nations, just below Scotland and at its lowest level since the end of September. A total of 839,065 people have been given their first dose of vaccine, including 15,282 in the latest day. The latest daily figures also show more than 25,433 have now been given the full course. The latest day saw 6,091 second doses in the latest day. Figures are subject to built-in time lag, for verification and quality assurance. More than 1.4 million people in all belong to one of the nine priority groups - including the overlap of about 192,000 people who may belong to more than one group. This leaves another million or so people under 50, without a risk condition, who will be line eventually to receive a vaccine.  Infections are continuing to fall in Wales, according to the most recent Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. It took throat and nose swab tests from hundreds of households in Wales. From the results, it can estimate that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 12 February, a decrease on the previous survey a week ago. This is one in 125 people - down from one in 85 people, or 0.81%, down from 1.16% of the population. The survey is seen as a useful way of looking at the pandemic's progress because although numbers are limited, it picks up people who are asymptomatic. When broken down into health board areas, the household survey results led to infection estimates ranging from one in 125 people in Aneurin Bevan to one in 185 in Swansea Bay. But these are based on much smaller sample sizes. The modelling was based on swab tests from 20,580 people over six weeks from 10,734 households. In Wales, ONS said there were early signs the percentage of people testing positive compatible with the new UK variant is no longer decreasing - but numbers have to be treated with caution. Similar surveys suggested infections were falling in other parts of the UK, estimating one in 80 people in England, one in 150 people in Scotland and one in 75 people in Northern Ireland had the virus in the same week. A total of 82 people were being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on 18 February -  numbers have fallen back to those last seen in early December and non-Covid patients have outnumbered those being treated for Covid in intensive care for more than a week. Figures are less than half those seen at the peak in April (when it was 164 patients). Doctors are also known to be trying to treat more seriously ill patients without putting them on ventilation.  Admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 cases were running at a daily seven-day average of 79 on 18 February. This is the lowest since 10 December. Aneurin Bevan hospitals had the highest numbers of Covid admissions, a daily average of 29 over the last week. Covid admissions now make up 7.9% of all hospital admissions. Covid-19 infections within hospitals have risen compared to the previous week and there have now been nearly 4,000 reported across Wales since the start of November. There were 211 new hospital onset cases across Wales in the week to 14 February, according to official PHW figures. This is a rise of 60 on the total the week before. Cardiff and Vale health board has the most ""probable"" and ""definite"" cases for the week - 67 - and has 385 cases since January. Overall, 88% of Covid-19 infections occurred in the community - 12% were caught within hospitals. The hospital-acquired proportion has more than doubled since earlier in the pandemic. Health officials say we should also look at how many people are consulting their GP - as another indicator of how the virus is progressing. This surveillance data involves about 400 GP practices. PHW's data dashboard also shows consultations for flu and respiratory conditions. The most recent figures showed around 6.5 consultations per 100,000 people for suspected Covid-19 - its lowest proportion since September. It compared with about 0.6 per 100,000 for flu symptoms. In Wales, there were 314 deaths involving Covid-19 the week ending 5 February, which is 47 fewer than last week and a third successive weekly fall after the highest recorded during any week of the pandemic. It was the seventh highest total registered during the pandemic and was 34.8% of all deaths, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).   The most deaths were in north Wales again - 73 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area. Fifty of these were in hospitals and 20 in care homes. There were also 65 deaths in the Cardiff and Vale area. The number of deaths also rose to 17 in Powys, its highest weekly number since the first wave of the pandemic. Elsewhere, the number of weekly deaths fell. RCT, with 821 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths occurring in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 753, up to the latest week.  So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 974 to 903, but it was still 143 deaths (18.8%) above the five-year average. The highest proportion of excess deaths was 69.8% in London. In Wales, the number of deaths from 13 March 2020 up to 5 February 2021 was 35,772. Of these, 7,005 deaths (19.6%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. When deaths occurring up to 5 February but counting registrations in the week or so after, the total is as 7,089. The hotspot was in the Aneurin Bevan health board area of south-east Wales in the first wave of the pandemic. Over the summer, Betsi Cadwaladr health board, in north Wales, showed more of a spike in Covid-19 deaths compared with health boards in south Wales.  In the second wave, the deaths are happening over a more widespread area but both Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Betsi Cadwaladr have been seeing highest numbers so far. When looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has three in the highest 10 across England and Wales. RCT has 347.3 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic, the fourth-highest in England and Wales.  Merthyr is seventh with 328.2. Bridgend is also in the highest 10. Ceredigion, in the first wave of the pandemic the second lowest behind the Isles of Scilly, now has the 25th-lowest death rate with 111.4 per 100,000. There are three Welsh counties below it, with Anglesey the lowest in Wales and seventh lowest across England and Wales on 78.5 deaths per 100,000. Broken down at localised levels, we can see the south Wales valleys and parts of Swansea and Port Talbot have the highest mortality figures in Wales for deaths due to Covid-19, in figures published in January. Two of the highest, when these are converted into crude mortality rates based on population size, are both in RCT: Tonyrefail West (53 deaths, which is 515.7 deaths per 100,000) and Penrhiwceiber, where there have been 26 deaths and a mortality rate of 436.9. Brynmawr in Blaenau Gwent, Port Talbot East (Neath Port Talbot) and Porth East and Ynsyhir (RCT) are also in the highest five. There have been a total of 1,554 Covid-19 deaths in care homes up to 5 February, making up 22% of all coronavirus deaths in Wales. Meanwhile, Care Inspectorate Wales (CIW) compiles its own figures, which showed they have been notified of 7,774 deaths among adult care home residents, from all causes, since 1 March 2020.  This is 36% more care home deaths than notified in the same time period last year, and 43% higher than for the same period two years ago. Of these, 1,844 deaths involved suspected or confirmed Covid-19, which makes up 24% of all reported deaths. CIW is now updating its figures every two weeks. There were 65 care home deaths in Wales where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate in the latest ONS weekly total in Wales, the fewest total for more than a month.   The ONS has published figures which suggest the mortality rate - when it is age standardised - is twice as high for Covid-19 deaths in Wales' poorest areas than its least deprived ones. There were 309.4 deaths per 100,000 population up to 29 January in the most deprived areas. This compares with 159 deaths in least deprived parts, according to the ONS figures. In January, the mortality rate rose ""significantly"" for a third month, to 374.4 deaths per 100,000 people in Wales. The ONS has also developed a tool so people can see the number of deaths from the virus at a neighbourhood level. Covid-19 was the biggest cause of death in Wales for the second successive month, new figures show. The virus accounted for 27.4% of all registered deaths in December, a higher proportion than in England, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Based on provisional data, Covid was the leading cause of death for 2020. In terms of leading causes of death, following Covid-19 was dementia and Alzheimer's disease and then heart disease. For flu and pneumonia, there were 38.6 deaths per 100,000 - the seventh leading cause of death - down on the five-year average of 73.2 in December. Covid had also been the leading cause of death in Wales in both April and May before dropping back. The ONS said based on provisional figures, Covid was the leading cause of death in 2020 in Wales. The mortality rate is also higher than each of the last nine years in Wales. For 2020 deaths registered by 9 January this year, there were 2,794 more deaths than the five-year average (which is 8.3% higher).  The ONS analysis of death registrations points to Covid-19 being the underlying cause of death in 12.5% of all deaths - 4,532 deaths - that occurred in Wales. It was the underlying cause in 12.9% of deaths in England. A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. It has been estimated by ONS that 88.2% of deaths in Wales, where Covid is mentioned on the certificate, the virus is the underlying cause, so deaths will be due to Covid-19. More than 2.58 million tests had been carried out by 14 February, including 1.13m on key workers and care home residents. There were 80,619 tests in the most recent week, slightly more than the week before although numbers have been going down in recent weeks. This is 38% fewer than we saw in the week before Christmas and an indication of far fewer people presenting themselves with symptoms. Wales has access to 37,000 laboratory tests per day currently if required, with about 15,000 of these at NHS Wales labs. A total of 36,860 people in their 20s have also tested positive - barely a 1% rise on last week's figures and more signs of the slow-down. This age group is 18.5% of all people testing positive so far. Around 12% more children under 10 and 8% more children and young people aged 10 to 19 have tested now positive than a month ago, which is also slowing down. With the end of term and patchy data, the most recent analysis of tests amongst university students found small numbers of cases, a rolling average of just seven cases. Separate figures, now published weekly, show 77.7% of schools have been affected by the virus since September.  There have been 4,090 cases in staff and 4,816 in pupil from September up to 17 February.   There were 44 new cases in staff in last week, 51 in pupils in the most recent week. Currently, there are about 39,000 pupils a day able to attend school. We can also see from more detailed PHW figures how many different key workers and others have been tested - and how speedily results are coming back. There were 292 positive tests in care homes in Wales in the most recent week, the lowest recorded since early October.  Care home testing of elderly residents is continuing, despite the vaccination programme, because scientific advisers believe it would be premature to stop at this early stage, of the roll-out. Across Wales, 31,872 residents and staff were tested in the week beginning 8 February, as part of the weekly testing regime. Broken down, 3,895 care home residents were tested and 110 (2.8%) were positive in results from NHS laboratories. Also, 70 care home workers tested positive, with more than 98% of tests negative. The vast majority of test processing from care homes is done by Lighthouse labs but their results do not distinguish between residents and staff. There were another 112 (0.61%) positive tests results from these labs.  Care Home Inspectorate Wales also now publish separate figures around testing, which showed only 87 (8.3%) care homes in Wales had notified one or more positive cases in staff or residents - the lowest number since the figures started being published in December. Less than a quarter of care homes had notified one or more confirmed cases of Covid in staff or residents, in the past 20 days.

The ""test, trace, protect"" system for contacting people with coronavirus and tracing contacts has been seeing an improvement in speed, albeit with smaller numbers in recent weeks. Of the 2,342 positive cases that were eligible for follow-up in Wales in the most recent week, 98% were reached, 92% within 24 hours of referral to the contact tracing system and 96% were reached within 48 hours. This is the slightly better than the previous week. This equates to 94% of those successfully reached being reached within 24 hours and 99% within 48 hours. It's estimated that 10% of contacts of an infected person develop Covid. Of the 7,995 close contacts that were eligible for follow-up, 91% were reached within 24 hours of being identified by a positive case. The number of cases in north-east Wales is also reflected in the figures, which shows 26% of close contact tracing was in the Betsi Cadwaladr area in the latest week, compared to 14% two months ago. The ONS and public health bodies are measuring things in a different way - and information is available at different times so do not expect to see the same thing. The data is revised and PHW refines and verifies it and then each individual fatality is assigned to the date at which it occurred. The graphic above shows how it looks when you compare figures from all the different data sources - and how there is a difference between ONS and PHW and also between ONS and the UK Government count, which is of people who died within 28 days of a first positive test for Covid. There is a difference of around 2,000 deaths. NHS Wales' chief statistician argues to look at the trend and the curve of the outbreak, it is best to focus on deaths on the day they have occurred rather than the daily PHW figures as they first appear, as these can be volatile. So the chart above shows the daily deaths, as they have been adjusted, as well as a seven-day rolling average. By 14 February, there was an average of about 18 deaths a day - with a peak on 3 January. There were 57 deaths occurring on 1 January, the highest daily figure in the pandemic. The 13 worst days for deaths occurring, as reported by PHW, were during the second wave in late December and January. The most deaths reported on a single day by ONS was 81 on 11 January.

Councillor suspended over 'Covid-breach wedding',"By Rahila BanoBBC Asian Network A councillor accused of breaching Covid restrictions by flying to Pakistan and attending a wedding has been suspended by the local Labour Party. Photos were shared on Facebook last weekend allegedly showing Manchester City Councillor Aftab Razaq at the celebration in the city of Kharian. Under the current Covid-19 rules in the UK, it is illegal to travel abroad for holidays and other leisure purposes. Mr Razaq, 52, has yet to respond to the BBC's request for a comment. He was seen in the photos apparently ignoring social distancing and not wearing a mask, despite virus rules in Pakistan making this mandatory. Councillor Pat Karney, secretary of Manchester Labour, told the BBC he would ""thoroughly investigate these matters"". He said the Labour group had seen the photographs but ""despite their best efforts"" had not been able to contact the Whalley Range councillor, who received a coronavirus vaccine in January. ""All Manchester councillors must rigorously abide by Covid regulations and we will take action against any individual who does not,"" Mr Karney added. Liberal Democrat opposition leader John Leech said he was ""flabbergasted"" by the alleged breach and called for Mr Razaq to resign.  ""I can't see how there can be any justification for a councillor to be travelling thousands of miles to go to a wedding and then for it to be put on Facebook which just sets a terrible example,"" he said. ""Unless there is some explanation and I can't come up with any reasonable explanation I think he should resign.""    Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

"Jail term for wife killer 'too lenient', say MPs","A group of MPs are calling for the case of a man who killed his wife in lockdown to be reviewed because of its ""unduly lenient"" five year sentence. Labour's Harriet Harman, Jess Phillips and Alex Davies-Jones have all written to the attorney general to look at Anthony Williams' case. Williams, 70, was jailed for the manslaughter of his wife Ruth, 67, at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen. He admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility, saying ""I flipped out"". However, he was found not guilty of murder after a trial at Swansea Crown Court. All three are asking the attorney general Suella Braverman for the case to be passed to England and Wales' most senior court, the Court of Appeal, and expressed concern about the use of Williams' depression in his defence against the more serious charge of murder. Ms Harman, a former solicitor general and minister for justice, tweeted she would ask the attorney general to refer it to the Court of Appeal as an ""unduly lenient sentence"". The former solicitor said she hoped it would lead to an increase in Williams' sentence and criticised what she said was a ""loophole"" in the law which allowed Williams' defence barrister to argue his depression was a defence against being convicted of murder. ""If he went out in the street and killed a neighbour, there would be no question of him facing a murder charge,"" she said. ""You get a discount for it being your wife and you get a discount for it being in her own home where she should feel safe."" Meanwhile, Jess Phillips tweeted her support for Ms Harman, expressing concern that Williams may only serve half his sentence. The MP for Birmingham Yardley said: ""We're looking at somebody serving around 18 months in prison when there is a woman who is dead. ""The areas in which I think this case needs to be examined are the difference between how men and women pleading such a defence of diminished responsibility are managed, and the way that plays out, specifically in cases of alleged domestic murder. ""I want some assurances as somebody who is always seeking to improve criminal justice outcomes for victims of domestic violence, about how this case was managed both by the courts, but also by the Crown Prosecution Service."" Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, also wrote on Friday to the attorney general, urging her to intervene and refer the case to the Court of Appeal. In the letter she posted on Twitter, she said she was ""horrified"" that  Williams was ""given such a lenient sentence at a time where so many are struggling with the mental strain of the pandemic"". She wrote that the UK government's Domestic Abuse Bill was a ""landmark piece of legislation,"" but added: ""Sadly, there are cases such as Mr Williams' whereby the law is failing victims."" #HerNameWasRuthWilliams pic.twitter.com/OFQGhmAeBc She added that she was worried the sentence could ""act as a catalyst"" and that ""we're going to see even more extremes happening, with perpetrators thinking they have an excuse or a cover"". Ms Davies-Jones also said she was concerned that Ms Braverman is due to go on maternity leave this month, with the UK government yet to announce a replacement for her. During his Swansea Crown Court trial, the jury heard how Williams strangled his wife of 46 years after an argument on 28 March, days after the start of the first lockdown began. Williams had not slept for several days after the start of restrictions in March because he was worrying over money, coronavirus and his health. A psychiatrist told the court the defendant's mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019, and the coronavirus pandemic had made things worse. No evidence was heard during the trial that Williams had a history of domestic abuse. Mrs Williams was found slumped in the porch of their home with keys in her hand - she was later pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport. While being driven to the police station, Williams told officers: ""It wasn't murder and I didn't mean to murder her. ""I just flipped, it wasn't me. I wouldn't hurt a fly, it wasn't me, I'm not like that and I don't know what came over me."" As he sentenced Williams, Judge Paul Thomas said: ""The overwhelming greatest tragedy is that a lady of 67 years who was in good health had her life ended at the hands of a man she had loved for nearly 50 years.""

When will it be my turn to be vaccinated?,"By Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in the UK is entering its next phase, after everyone in the top four priority groups was offered a jab. Most frontline health and social care staff, elderly care home residents, clinically extremely vulnerable people and over-70s have now been vaccinated.  They were first in line because of their risk from the virus, making up the top four in a list of nine high-priority groups.  Many areas are now inviting over-60s, as well as anyone over 16 with a health condition which increases their risk. Adult carers of disabled people and younger adults in care homes are also being offered jabs. All four nations of the UK follow these priorities, but the roll-out varies between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some over-50s are being vaccinated now along with people even younger, if they have underlying health conditions. About 17 million people are expected to be offered a jab by the start of May. Vaccinating people in all nine groups should protect around 99% of those most at risk of dying. Police officers and teachers have not been given priority. They will be vaccinated in line with their age group.  Any change to priorities will be decided by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Two vaccines - developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - are currently being used in the UK to protect against Covid-19. A third - from Moderna - has also been approved. The Oxford vaccine offers a good level of protection against the 'Kent' variant now dominant in the UK. Early research on other vaccines, including Pfizer, suggest they also protect against this variant. All have been shown to be effective at preventing people from becoming seriously ill and dying from Covid-19. There are concerns that Covid vaccines may not work as well against variants spotted in South Africa and Brazil, and in some UK variants too. Nonetheless, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the Oxford vaccine should still be used in countries where these variants are present. People should feel confident about getting vaccinated, the government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, has said. The ""immediate threat"" is from the Kent variant, he said, and there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines are effective against that. New versions of the vaccines are already being worked on and the plan is to have them ready by the autumn. They are likely to be offered as a routine booster against Covid.  The approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best protection against Covid. In the UK, people were initially told they would get a second dose three to four weeks after the first. But to ensure a speedy roll-out, the UK's chief medical officers extended the gap to 12 weeks. This approach is now backed by the WHO which says giving two doses 8-12 weeks apart increases the Oxford vaccine's effectiveness and provides greater protection. A recent study found the Oxford vaccine remained 76% effective during the three months after the first dose. There was also evidence it could reduce the spread of the virus. However, some doctors are worried that a long gap between doses of the Pfizer vaccine could make it less effective. You'll be invited to book an appointment as soon as it's your turn, by phone or letter. Thousands of vaccination sites are operating in places including hospital hubs, GP surgeries, pharmacies and temporary vaccination centres. The official guidance says everyone should get the same vaccine for both doses. In very rare circumstances - if only one vaccine is available, or it's not known which was given for the first dose - a different vaccine can be used. However, a UK trial is investigating whether mixing vaccines could offer better protection than two doses of the same one. The UK has ordered seven vaccines and expects to receive 407 million doses - more than enough for every adult to receive two. The aim is to vaccinate as many people as possible over the age of 18.  The vaccines have not been tested in children so they won't receive them until more research has been carried out. Getting a Covid vaccine is not compulsory because experts say this wouldn't help create public confidence. A very small number of people have experienced a severe allergic reaction - known as anaphylaxis - when vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine.  You should discuss any serious allergies with your healthcare professional before being vaccinated. Most people will not be affected in any way, although mild side-effects are possible. Vaccination should only be considered for pregnant women when the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks. This may be where the risk of catching coronavirus is high, or where underlying health conditions mean a high risk of Covid complications. There are no specific safety concerns with the vaccines - but they were not tested on pregnant women. Women who are breastfeeding can be given either vaccine.  No - this vaccine is being rolled out free to people via the NHS. You can't jump the queue by paying. Vaccine priority groups - UK government advice",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55045639,1
Dublin Airport passenger numbers down 78% in 2020,"Passenger numbers at Dublin Airport declined by 78% in 2020 due to Covid-19, the airport has said. About 7.4 million people travelled through Dublin Airport in 2020, with more than half of them doing so in January and February. The airport lost 25.5 million passengers last year - the last time it had fewer than eight million passengers in a calendar year was back in 1994.  Passenger numbers fell by 89% to three million between March and December.  Those numbers have fallen further since the end of last year, as passenger numbers in January were down by 90%. Dublin Airport's managing director Vincent Harrison said it had been a ""hugely challenging year"" for the airport and Ireland's aviation sector.  The figures have emerged as Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin indicated that level 5 lockdown restrictions, which are the highest level of restrictions for the Republic of Ireland, could remain in place until the end of April. On Wednesday, it was announced that anyone travelling to the Republic of Ireland from coronavirus hotspots will have to quarantine in hotels under new legislation. It would mean first-time offenders could be fined Â£3,475 (â¬4,000) and face a month in prison for not adhering to the rules. It is the latest in a number of measures that have been introduced by the Irish government to curb travel during the pandemic.  Earlier this month, Northern Irish residents were told that they could face a fine of â¬100 (Â£88) if they were caught crossing the border without a ""reasonable excuse"".  Any adult who is detected travelling to an Irish airport or port for a non-essential trip or holiday abroad currently faces a â¬500 fine while, back in December 2020, the Republic of Ireland banned UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread of a new variant of coronavirus.  On Friday, a further 28 coronavirus-related deaths and 763 new cases were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's total number of deaths to 4,109. At the moment, daily passenger traffic in Dublin Airport is currently down by up to 98% compared to the same period in 2020.  The airport's managing director Vincent Harrison said aviation was one of the sectors of the Irish economy that was hardest hit by the pandemic and this is reflected in the passenger numbers for the previous year.  He added that the ""reduction in air travel and the introduction of travel restrictions in most markets had a very significant impact on passenger numbers during the year"".  Back in 2019 the airport had flights to more than 190 destinations in 42 different countries operated by nearly 50 airlines.  However, in April 2020, it had flights to just 22 destinations in 11 countries operated by just seven airlines.  Mr Harrison said that aviation plays a huge role in Ireland's economy and that it will be a ""key sector in helping that economy to recover in the wake of the pandemic"".

"Unblock Covid logjam for new laws, senior MPs urge","Crucial government policies have been held up too long by the Covid crisis, ministers have been told.    Senior MPs say new laws, including on post-Brexit environmental standards and sentencing reform, should be put back on the agenda.  It comes after debating time for non-Covid topics was scaled back to make way for emergency laws and statements. But select committee chairs said it was time for delayed bills to return.   The demand has been made by the powerful cross-party liaison committee, which includes the heads of each Commons select committee. In a letter to Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, the committee's chairman Sir Bernard Jenkin said the pandemic had ""understandably impacted"" time for new bills.  ""But now that this is closer to being under control, we would urge the government to deliver on its commitments to and demands from select committees on other vitally important legislation,"" he added. The Conservative MP called on the government - which sets time for almost all new laws - to give ""due priority"" to certain bills over the next year.  He added that this legislation, whose next stage in Parliament has yet to be set by the government, included:  Sir Bernard added that the reintroduction of the Environment Bill should be a ""government priority,"" to fill a ""gap"" in regulations since the UK left the Brexit transition period.  Campaigners have reacted angrily to repeated delays to the legislation, which was first launched back in July 2018 and sets new targets for protecting nature.  He said he was also keen for MPs to hold initial debates on draft government bills for reforming the rental market and overhauling England's planning system.  He also called on ministers to publish legislation to ban ""gay conversion therapy"" and on tougher sentences for dangerous driving, where they have promised action but legislation has not yet been published.  And he added that bills put forward by MPs, including one on regulating forensic science, were unlikely to pass before the current session ends.  This is because Friday sittings - when this type of bill is usually debated - have been suspended in a bid to reduce the risk of Covid to MPs and their staff.  A government spokesman said: ""The Queen's Speech will outline the legislative programme for the next session in the usual way.  ""The government welcomes scrutiny from select committees and will bring forward its legislative commitments when parliamentary time allows.""

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  The health secretary acted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contracts it had signed during the Covid pandemic, a court has ruled. A judge said Matt Hancock ""breached his legal obligation"" by not publishing details within 30 days of contracts being signed. The public had a right to know where the ""vast"" amounts spent had gone and how contracts were awarded, he added. The government said it fully recognised the ""importance of transparency"". Covid-19 vaccine passports are ""feasible"" but not until we know more about how long immunity lasts, experts say. The passports also have the potential to discriminate against the young, pregnant or those who cannot have the jab for medical reasons, according to a Royal Society report, which said this must be factored into any such scheme before launching. It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan. The prime minister will spend the weekend finalising his ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England and opening up the economy. The government is ""crunching the numbers"" ahead of Monday's announcement, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said. New data is expected to suggest vaccines have cut transmission rates. But Downing Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation. Boris Johnson has said his top priority will be the reopening of schools. Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK, latest data from the Office for National Statistics shows. The figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks. Experts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus. The data is based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms. The latest R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass on the virus to, on average - is estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, which also suggests infection numbers are shrinking.  There was positive news in Wales today, after it was announced that four people from a maximum of two households will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. Stay at home travel restrictions are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be lifted or eased in three weeks' time. He also said he hoped children aged eight and over may be able to return to primary schools from 15 March. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon.

"'Reckless' if all pupils back 8 March, say unions","By Jeanette LongBBC News education reporter It would be ""reckless"" to bring back all pupils in England to school together on 8 March, says a joint statement by teachers' unions.  Rather than risk another ""spike"" in infections, they are calling for a more ""cautious"" and ""phased"" return. Nine teachers' and head teachers' unions have urged the government to commit to that date only if the scientific evidence is clear that it is safe.  The prime minister will announce the plan for reopening schools on Monday. The collective statement from education unions says they are committed to bringing children back into the classroom as soon as possible - but have concerns it may lead to another surge in the virus.  They say they are ""increasingly concerned that the government is minded to order a full return of all pupils on Monday 8 March"". That has been the target since the prime minister announced the date in January. The teachers' unions argue that uncertainty about the role that schools play in the transmission of the virus should mean a more cautious approach. A full return would mean 10 million pupils and staff travelling to and from school each day, says a statement from signatories including the biggest classroom union the National Education Union. They call for an ""opening phased over a period of time"", similar to the ""approach being taken in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland"".  ""It allows public health experts to assess the impact of the first phase before moving to the next,"" say the teachers' unions. The decisions on England's return to school will be announced on Monday, when the prime minister will set out his ""road map"" for reopening after lockdown. This is expected to be accompanied by a series of announcements on schools in the following days - with funding for catch-up classes, details of how testing will work and how cancelled GCSEs and A-levels will be replaced this summer. There have been suggestions that after initial Covid tests in school, testing will be carried out at home by parents. There will be new guidance on face masks, which could see them being worn in secondary schools where social distancing is not possible. The nine unions signing up to the joint statement are the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), GMB, National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), NASUWT, National Education Union (NEU), National Governance Association (NGA), Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA), Unison, and Unite. On Thursday, the ASCL head teachers' union had warned that it would not be practical to carry out Covid tests on all secondary pupils if they arrived back together. In response, England's Department for Education said: ""We know schools, parents and pupils need clarity on plans as soon as possible, which is why we have committed to providing two weeks' notice for them to prepare. ""The prime minister is due to set out plans for schools reopening on 22 February, and pupils will return from 8 March at the earliest."" In Scotland and Wales, younger primary school year groups will begin to return from 22 February. Older primary pupils in Wales could begin to return from 15 March. In Northern Ireland, younger primary pupils will return to classrooms on 8 March. They will then go back to remote learning on 22 March, with the return then of secondary pupils in exam years until the Easter holidays.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-56130347,1
The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts,"By Steve DuffyBBC news The road out of lockdown may not be easy and still have twists and turns - but what should we be looking out for? Scientists and health officials are looking carefully at a number of key indicators, before ministers in Wales make their decisions on what, when and how restrictions will be eased. Those indicators were dubbed ""circuit breakers."" Here are a few of the main factors to keep an eye on: Case rates can tell us how many people with Covid-19 symptoms are presenting themselves for tests which then come back positive. It looks back at the most recent week of stable data, after most test results have come back. It's only a snapshot of the virus as it relies on people asking for a test - and there is a recognition that some may be reluctant to do so. Others may have the virus and not know it, as they are asymptomatic. But since the summer, when tests were fully available to anyone who thought they might have Covid, it has been a good measure to look at how the virus is spreading and affecting different parts of Wales. The case rate in Wales as a whole was for a period in December, one of the highest in the world. But it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It currently has the lowest rate of the UK nations, just below Scotland and at its lowest level since the end of September. Breaking the figures down, there has been a dramatic drop in previous hot-spot areas like Bridgend, Neath Port Talbot and the south Wales valleys. And while the new UK variant of the virus has been more resilient in north east Wales, case rates here too have been falling. Meanwhile, infection rates in care homes have also been dropping, despite weekly testing continuing alongside the vaccination roll-out. The ideal case rate is below 50.  Only Ceredigion, Bridgend, Blaenau Gwent and Pembrokeshire are currently under or around this threshold.  It's perhaps worth remembering that when the decision was made for Caerphilly to become the first area to go into a local lockdown on 8 September it was at 73 cases per 100,000 before the rate quickly rose.  It is at 82.3 per 100,000 now, but the trend is downwards. This is the proportion of people who get a test who come back positive for Covid. Put simply, the World Health Organization suggests areas need to see a 5% positivity rate or below for a couple of weeks before restrictions are lifted. Wales as a whole is at 7.9%, its lowest point since early October. Ceredigion (2.8%), Pembrokeshire (4.7%) are within that threshold and Denbighshire (5.1%), Merthyr Tydfil (5.2.%) and Bridgend (5.5%) are among areas close to it. The natural consequence of more Covid cases is more people in hospital and the strategy, particularly over the winter months which normally bring extra pressures anyway, has been to avoid the NHS being ""overwhelmed."" In January, we saw record numbers of patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds. There were large numbers too of ""recovering"" patients - those still sick with the effects of the virus or in rehabilitation, but unable to be discharged. On Thursday, the number of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients fell to their lowest levels since 23 October. The proportion of Covid patients to everyone else in hospital is also falling now. Numbers in critical care or on ventilation are also less than half those seen at the peak in April, when there were 164 patients across Welsh hospitals in a single day. Intensive care patients with other conditions for the last week have outnumbered those with Covid. The most reliable figures are from the Office for National Statistics, which show the total number of deaths in Wales have now exceeded 7,000. But its weekly reports show a fall in the last three weeks.  The peak in the second wave of the pandemic came on 11 January, when there were 81 deaths. This is even higher than the peak of the first wave, which happened on 12 April, when there were 73 deaths involving Covid-19. Public Health Wales, which provides a daily snapshot of deaths from confirmed Covid-19 cases, also indicates a fall. There is still however a daily average of about 18 deaths a day. There is an inevitable lag between community cases, hospital admissions and deaths, so the hope is that this trend downwards will continue. Another snapshot of the virus' progress is the ongoing ONS swab survey.  Since the summer, thousands of people in Wales have been asked to take a throat and nose swab. This can pick up people who don't even know they have the virus but who may still be unwittingly spreading it. The latest survey on Friday indicates infections are continuing to fall. The ONS estimates that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 in the week to 12 February, a further decrease on the previous survey a week ago. This is one in 125 people - down from one in 85 people, or 0.81%, down from 1.16% of the population. The R-number - the transmission rate - which is calculated using several of these key factors remains at 0.7 to 0.9 in Wales - the same range it has been for the last few weeks. The growth rate is encouraging, indicating that the virus infections could be shrinking at -6% and -2% per day. These estimates are included in the latest report on Friday from the Welsh Government's scientific advisory group. But the group issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance, saying that the ""best way to reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging is to keep infection rates low. Relaxing measures too early or quickly will lead to large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths."" Health officials are also looking at how many of us are seeing a GP about Covid - or contacting NHS Direct and 111 These all go to build up a picture for the roadmap out of lockdown. The most recent figures showed around 6.5 GP consultations per 100,000 people for suspected Covid-19 - its lowest proportion since September. It compared with about 0.6 per 100,000 for flu symptoms. One spanner in the works is the new UK variant - faster-spreading - which is now present in between 60-90% of new cases in different parts of Wales.  Mutations are not unexpected with viruses but still present a public health challenge. With fewer cases to deal with, higher proportions of tests are now being sequenced by genetic scientists who within a few days can identify exactly where any variants are.  The message from public health officials is people still need to follow guidelines, while they will be keeping a close eye to ensure these infections do not get out of control.

Asymptomatic testing to be rolled out in Glasgow,"Asymptomatic testing is being rolled out in Glasgow to identify people who may have Covid-19 and are spreading the virus without knowing it. The programme, funded by the Scottish government, will offer lateral flow tests to people without  symptoms. From 1 March, walk-in test centres - staffed by the armed forces - will be located at Glasgow Central Mosque and at Govanhill Neighbourhood Centre. People in the local communities without symptoms are invited to get a test. The walk-in centres will be open for several weeks. Dr Linda de Caestecker, public health director for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), said: ""We know that Covid-19 is often spread by people who don't have symptoms or they are so mild they do not recognise they have the infection. ""Asymptomatic testing enables identification of infection so that people are not spreading the infection to their families, work colleagues or the wider community as they go shopping or exercising. This has the potential to reduce spread overall."" She added that asymptomatic testing will also help experts learn about the rate of infection in people not showing signs of the virus.  ""Please come forward for testing to help to reduce transmission of the virus in this area,"" Dr de Caestecker said. ""The centres will also give advice about support for isolation for people with a positive test."" Swabs from lateral flow tests do not need to be sent to labs for analysis and the results should be known within an hour. Similar test facilities will be set up in other Glasgow neighbourhoods in coming weeks. Waste water tests and the most up-to-date data will be used to identify communities where asymptomatic testing is needed. NHSGGC said additional mobile testing would also be undertaken as a rapid response to any outbreaks. Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said: ""I would encourage people not displaying Covid-19 symptoms to volunteer for a test where asymptomatic testing centres have been set up in their local area. ""The test results will help to detect the virus and limit its spread in our communities."" Authorities are also urging people to continue following measures including physical distancing, using face coverings and hand-washing to help reduce the risk of spreading the virus. Public health minister Mairi Gougeon said: ""Targeted testing in this way will help us find and isolate more cases by targeting resources with communities where there is high prevalence, helping us to identify more cases of the virus and giving us all a better chance of stopping it from spreading. ""However, a test only tells us if we are positive at the point in time that we are being tested.  It does not mean that we can stop following all of the rules and guidelines which are in place to protect all of us. ""Testing is only one layer of protection against this virus - all others, including vaccination and the FACTS guidance, work to greatest effect when they work together, so it is essential people continue to follow the restrictions currently in place to suppress Covid to the lowest possible level in Scotland.""

UK pledges surplus Covid vaccines to poorer nations,"Boris Johnson is pledging to donate most of the UK's surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries in a speech to a virtual G7 meeting on Friday. He urged rich countries to back a 100-day target for the developing new vaccines for future emerging diseases. The UK has ordered more than 400 million doses of various vaccines, so many will be left over once all adults are vaccinated. But anti-poverty campaigners say the UK is not doing enough. Decisions on when and how much of the surplus will be distributed will be made later this year, with ministers taking into account the supply chain and whether booster shots are needed in the autumn. The prime minister told his fellow leaders: ""Science is finally getting the upper hand on Covid. Around the world [we need to] make sure everyone gets the vaccines that they need, so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" ""There is no point in us vaccinating our individual populations - we've got to make sure the whole world is vaccinated because this is a global pandemic and it's no use one country being far ahead of another, we've got to move together."" He said he wanted to ""ensure that we distribute vaccines at cost around the world - make sure everybody gets the vaccines that they need so that the whole world can come through this pandemic together."" After the meeting, the G7 leaders issued a statement committing to ""intensify cooperation on the health response to Covid-19"". It reaffirmed the group's support for ""affordable and equitable access to vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics, reflecting the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good."" French President Emmanuel Macron has told the Financial Times richer countries should send up to 4 to 5% of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. But Foreign Office minister James Cleverly told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK would be ""looking at a figure significantly greater than that"". He promised the government would be a ""global force for good"" in fighting the pandemic and, unlike ""some countries"", the UK would not use the promise of vaccine supplies to other countries as ""short-term diplomatic leverage"". But it was ""difficult to say"" at this stage when the sharing would happen, Mr Cleverly added. A government source said more than half of excess doses would go to Covax, a UN initiative intended to ensure wider access to vaccines. The UK government has donated Â£548m to the scheme, to which the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.9bn) in December. Almost 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, with 573,724 of these receiving two doses, according to the latest figures. By Naomi Grimley, global health correspondent In the global scramble to secure vaccines against Covid-19 many wealthy countries - which funded a lot of the research - have ended up buying more supplies than they need.  New figures from the anti-poverty pressure group, the One Campaign, reveal that Australia, Canada, Japan, the UK, and US and the EU have already secured more than 3bn doses - 1.2bn more than they need to give their entire populations two doses.  The UK has also given Â£548m to Covax - the UN-led attempt to get vaccines out to poorer countries.  But campaigners say they want hard facts on how many actual doses Britain will now be donating to the mechanism.  Some 130 countries in the world haven't done any vaccinations at all and healthcare workers in those countries remain at high risk.  And even if the Covax plan works, it's only designed to cover 20% of each nation's population - far short of the herd immunity expected in wealthy countries. Mr Johnson used his position as chairman of the G7 group of major economies to push the case for setting a 100-day target for developing vaccines when new diseases strike. He also told the group that it was important to ""build back better"" from the pandemic and face the ""great challenges"" of climate change, telling the leaders that he wanted ""to get some great things done"" at the G7 and the forthcoming Cop26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Friday's virtual meeting is the first gathering of G7 leaders since April 2020, and the first international meeting for new US President Joe Biden. The One Campaign, which aims to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, said Mr Johnson's commitment to Covax did not go far enough. UK director Romilly Greenhill said: ""The virus won't wait on us to be ready before it mutates, so we need to get these vaccines around the world as quickly as possible."" An Ipsos MORI poll of people from 18 countries showed that those in the UK were most likely to support donating surplus doses. Almost seven in 10 Britons (69%) want to pass on some of the country's extra doses to be used in other countries, whereas globally just under half (46%) say they would want their country to do this.   A further 12,057 new Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, alongside another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

UK sees further drop in coronavirus numbers,"Coronavirus infections are continuing to decrease around the UK, Office for National Statistics data shows.  The figures, for the seven days up to 12 February, reveal fewer people are testing positive for the virus in the community than in recent weeks. Experts warn that infection levels remain high however, with about 553,000 people found to have the virus.  And another 533 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. It brings the UK total to 119,920.  Daily figures show there were a further 12,027 new cases of coronavirus recorded in the UK on Friday.  More than 16.8 million people have had their first COVID vaccine dose, while 589,591 have had a second jab, bringing the total number of shots since the rollout began to nearly 17.5m. The latest R number, estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking. It means that, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 6 and 9 other people. Other studies of infection rates have shown a similar ""strong"" decline. The ONS results, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest: In England, there is some regional variation in the infection rate, although it is decreasing in all areas.  North-west England had the highest proportion of people of any region in England likely to test positive for coronavirus - at around one in 85 people. For London the estimate was one in 100, and for the West Midlands it was one in 110. Elsewhere, the estimates are: It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. Downing Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation. The Welsh government has already announced some changes. From Saturday, four people from two different households will be allowed to exercise outdoors together. And from Monday, children in Wales aged between three and seven are returning to school - as are young children in Scotland. Experts say any unlocking should be done slowly and cautiously to avoid a rebound surge in cases. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people can catch.  Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling prompted the first lockdown last March, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was hopeful more restrictions could be lifted by the end of May.  ""We will still have rules in place but... I think society will be a lot more normal."" Meanwhile, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said it was wrong to speculate on whether summer holidays will be allowed this year: ""I get how frustrating this is, it's completely natural. We all want to get a break from this, I get that. But it would wrong for me to start speculating now. ""We are assessing the numbers, we are making a judgment based on the science and we will be making an announcement on Monday. I can't go further than that."" A continued fall in new infections is one of the reassuring signs PM Boris Johnson will be considering this weekend, along with advisers, to decide if, when and how to start lifting some restrictions in England.  R is below 1, even with more infectious variants of the virus circulating, which is good news too.  But within the wider UK figures there are some regional differences that are worth keeping an eye on. Infection rates appear to be higher in some urban areas of England, for example.  Lessons from last year tell us that the virus can take off again if you unlock too quickly or too soon. 'One size fits all' may not be the best approach for every type of easing, although a shared priority is to get children back to school.  How many people have been vaccinated so far?

When will lockdown rules change?,"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England on Monday 22 February. How do the rules vary around the UK?   People must stay at home and only go out if you have ""a reasonable excuse"".  You are not to meet people socially unless you live together or form a support bubble. People breaking these rules can face fines, including an Â£800 penalty for those attending house parties of more than 15 people - and a Â£10,000 fine for the organisers. What's a 'reasonable excuse' for leaving home? Reasonable excuses include food shopping, meeting your support or childcare bubble or working where it's unreasonable to work from home.  You can exercise with one person from another household in an open public space.  Travel - internationally or around the UK - is only allowed if it is essential. If you are clinically extremely vulnerable you should only go out for medical appointments, exercise or essential reasons. You should not attend work.

On Thursday, the executive extended restrictions until 1 April. A review of the current measures will take place on 18 March.  Five more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Friday, bringing its total number of deaths to 2,026. It also recorded another 313 positive cases. Robin Swann reiterated that the pathway-to-recovery roadmap on easing restrictions, due to be published on 1 March, will be linked to data as opposed to specific dates.  Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said: ""One of the approaches the executive made in the first wave was to follow the data, not the dates and that approach has been replicated in other jurisdictions. ""So the roadmap will set a trajectory that won't be tied to dates and will be very clear about following the science.""  The current restrictions were imposed in Northern Ireland on 26 December to manage the spread of Covid-19. Mr Swann said the health service is currently supporting more Covid-19 inpatients than at the peak of the first wave.  ""So there would be no point in saying that where we will be in a number of weeks time will be far better than where we were at the same period of the first wave,"" he said. There are 403 people with Covid-19 in hospitals across Northern Ireland, of which 49 are being treated in intensive care and 41 have been ventilated. However, the vaccine does provide more cause for hope of recovery in this wave, the health minister added. On Friday afternoon it was announced that all carers over the age of 18 can now book the Covid-19 vaccine at a regional vaccination centre after the scheme was again extended. Previously only carers over 50 were eligible, but Mr Swann said he had decided to remove the age criteria and ""open this up to all carers"".Â   ""If you are a carer of someone who is elderly or disabled, you can now book your vaccine online at one of the seven trust centres,"" he said.   The latest NI Department of Health figures show that as of Friday, 466,524 vaccines have been administered, of which 436,143 were first doses and 30,381 were second doses. On Thursday, Mr Swann said he hoped to expand Northern Ireland's vaccine programme to carers of all ages soon. Speaking on Friday morning, he said: ""That will be the difference this time around that we didn't have last time - that extra support that the vaccine is actually bringing. ""But we're balancing hope with caution. Anything we're doing now will be reviewed on 18 March.  ""The figures are moving in the right direction, but they started from a very high point this time around.""  Mr Swann said the vaccine programme is beginning to make a difference.  ""It's really starting to make progress in the over 75s, but it takes time for that vaccine to have the positive impact it needs to have.""  Health officials have said they want to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day on 17 March. Mr Swann said there was ""a realisation across the executive table that if we take [easing lockdown] on a measured basis, we won't end up going back... into full lockdown in a few months time"". The head of the BMA in NI, Dr Tom Black, told BBC Radio Foyle it would have been difficult to justify further lifting of lockdown measures when the number of infections and hospital inpatients remains high.""We are half way down the slope, but have another few weeks of work to do,"" Dr Black said.""We can't afford to ease up for St Patrick's Day, we can't ease up for Easter. ""This continued lockdown is what is going to free up the summer, this is giving you the opportunity for some normality during summer."" On Thursday, it was announced that pre-school, nursery and primary school pupils in P1 to P3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school in Northern Ireland on 8 March. They will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of years 12 to 14, until the start of the Easter holidays. Mr Swann said: ""From a health point of view, it's about seeing a cohort to return for a few weeks and allowing us to asses what impact that has had on transmission and the R number."" He added that the decision over which year group returned was ""not something [the Department of Health] would get involved in"".  Stormont ministers have also agreed slight changes to click-and-collect services for some retailers. Those services will resume from 8 March for baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops.  From that date, the number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a public space will increase to 10 people from two households. Meanwhile, a body representing NI hotels has published a plan it said will help the industry recover from lockdown. The NI Hotels Federation said the tourism industry would be in ""survival mode"" for the immediate future. Its 'Return to Trading' plan sets out eight requests for the executive to consider, including the removal of the earlier closing time of 23:00 for hospitality, which was in force before the lockdown was imposed. The body's chief executive, Janice Gault, said the restriction had ""little effect on the spread of the virus, but has significant impact on the viability of trading"". She said extension of a reduction in VAT to 5% beyond 31 March was imperative and called for an extension of business rates relief for the next financial year, as well as a ""staged and controlled end"" to the furlough scheme. The document also suggests that holiday-at-home vouchers should be issued to promote domestic tourism as Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown in the coming months.

Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts,"Matt Hancock acted unlawfully when his department did not reveal details of contracts it had signed during the Covid pandemic, a court has ruled. A judge said the health secretary had ""breached his legal obligation"" by not publishing details within 30 days of contracts being signed. The public had a right to know where the ""vast"" amounts spent had gone and how contracts were awarded, he added. The government said it fully recognised the ""importance of transparency"". But Labour claimed the government's awarding of contracts was ""plagued by a lack of transparency, cronyism and waste"".  The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) has struck deals worth hundreds of millions of pounds during the coronavirus pandemic. Campaign group the Good Law Project and three MPs - Labour's Debbie Abrahams, Green Caroline Lucas and Lib Dem Layla Moran - took legal action against the department over its ""wholesale failure"" to disclose details of the contracts agreed. Under the law, the government is required to publish a ""contract award notice"" within 30 days of the awarding any contracts for public goods or services worth more than Â£120,000. The Good Law Project also claimed that the government breached its own transparency policy, which requires the publication of details of public contracts worth more than Â£10,000. In his ruling, Mr Justice Chamberlain said: ""There is now no dispute that, in a substantial number of cases, the secretary of state breached his legal obligation to publish contract award notices within 30 days of the award of contracts. ""There is also no dispute that the secretary of state failed to publish redacted contracts in accordance with the transparency policy."" The judge said the health secretary had spent ""vast quantities"" of public money on Covid-related goods and services during 2020. ""The public were entitled see who this money was going to, what it was being spent on and how the relevant contracts were awarded,"" he added. He said this was important so that competitors of those awarded contracts could understand whether the obligations had been breached. The judge also said publishing the details allowed bodies such as the National Audit Office, as well as Parliament and the public, to ""scrutinise and ask questions about this expenditure"". Mr Justice Chamberlain acknowledged that the situation faced by the DHSC during the first few months of the pandemic had been ""unprecedented"". He said it was ""understandable that attention was focused on procuring what was thought necessary to save lives"". But he added that the DHSC's ""historic failure"" to publish details of contracts awarded during the pandemic was ""an excuse, not a justification"". However, the judge dismissed the Good Law Project's argument that there had been a department-wide ""policy of de-prioritising compliance"" with the law and guidance.  ""This judgement is a victory for all of us concerned with proper governance and proof of the power of litigation to hold government to account,"" the Good Law Project said in a statement.  ""But there is still a long way to go before the government's house is in order."" The DHSC said the government had been ""working tirelessly"" to deliver what was needed to protect health and social care staff during the pandemic. ""This has often meant having to award contracts at speed to secure the vital supplies required to protect NHS workers and the public."" A spokeswoman added: ""We fully recognise the importance of transparency in the award of public contracts and continue to publish information about contracts awarded as soon as possible."" For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves called the judgement ""troubling and unsurprising, and a perfect example of how this government believes it is one rule for them another for the rest of us"".  She added: ""This government's contracting has been plagued by a lack of transparency, cronyism and waste and they must take urgent steps to address this now - by winding down emergency procurement, urgently releasing details of the VIP fast lane, and publishing all outstanding contracts by the end of the month.""

Will children be back at school before Easter?,"The prime minister will make an announcement on Monday about the re-opening of schools in England.  Boris Johnson has said that it would be his top priority, as part of the ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions.  The government has previously said its aim is to get all pupils in England back to the classroom on 8 March.  However, it's not certain that every pupil will be able to return before the Easter holidays at the start of April. Teachers' unions have called for reopening to be ""staggered"" to allow for Covid testing of pupils and staff. Downing Street has not commented on the details of Monday's unlocking plan. Primary and secondary schools have offered remote learning for most pupils since the beginning of January.  The children of key workers and children deemed vulnerable can still go to school each day - including those without access to a laptop at home, or a quiet place to study.  The government says schools should provide three to five hours of teaching a day for pupils at home, depending on age.  Colleges and universities have been teaching students remotely - except courses for future key workers (including medicine and veterinary science). Nurseries and other early years settings remain open. Pupils aged three to seven will return to classrooms from Monday 22 February - along with some older pupils on vocational courses. First Minister Mark Drakeford says he hopes older primary pupils - and secondary pupils preparing for exams - will be back on Monday 15 March ""provided things continue to improve"". Schools and colleges are already open for children of key workers, vulnerable learners and those completing essential exams or assessments. Special schools are open where possible. Scotland's youngest pupils will return to the classroom full time from 22 February.  The move will include all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children as part of a phased reopening. There will also be a very limited part-time return for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs she hoped to set out the next phase of school reopening during the first week of March, but said there was unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March. At the moment, schools, early learning and childcare services can only open their doors to the children of key workers and vulnerable youngsters. Some special schools are open.  Schools will open to primary school pupils in years 1-3 on 8 March.  Children in pre-school settings are also likely to return on 8 March, while pupils in years 12-14 in post-primary schools will return to class on 22 March. However, pupils in years 4-7 in primaries and years 8-11 in post-primaries will not return to school before the Easter break at the start of April. Vulnerable children and children of key workers can go to school, and special schools remain open. In England, A-levels, AS levels and GCSE exams have been cancelled and teachers' estimated grades will be used instead.  Primary school SATs will not go ahead this year, nor will phonics or timetable testing.  Scotland's Higher and Advanced Higher exams have been cancelled for 2021, with final grades to be based on teacher assessment. The National 5 exams have also been cancelled. The Welsh government has cancelled GCSEs, AS and A-levels. Grades were going to be based on classroom assessments instead but will now be determined by teachers, based on evidence such as mock exams and coursework. In Northern Ireland, no GCSE, AS and A-level examinations will go ahead this year. Alternative arrangements will be announced soon. The government has paused plans to roll out rapid testing of close contacts in schools, except for a small number of secondary schools and colleges.  If any pupil or teacher tests positive for Covid, they must go home and self-isolate for 10 days. Anyone who has been in close contact with the person testing positive must also self-isolate.

What is the UK's R number and why does it matter?,"The R number has fallen again in the UK, which means that coronavirus infections are continuing to drop. The latest R estimate for the whole of the UK, from the government's scientific advisory group Sage, is between 0.6 and 0.9. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread.  R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity.  That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others.  Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading. You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards.   Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading.  If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases increases. But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one. The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops.  Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020.  Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one.  Although the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences. Scotland's estimated R number is between 0.7 and 0.9. In Wales the number is between 0.7 and 0.9 - while in Northern Ireland it is between 0.7 and 0.8. In England, the highest estimated R rates are in the North East and Yorkshire, which is between 0,7 and 1.0. The R number is one of the big three. Another is severity - some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly.  The last is the number of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases. A vaccination programme, like the one currently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number. A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52473523,1
LGBT+ charity helps teenagers through pandemic,"A hardship fund set up in memory of a 15-year-old who took his own life has been helping LGBT+ teenagers through the Covid-19 pandemic. Noah Lomax, a gay and autistic teenager from Crookes, Sheffield, died in 2018 and his parents founded his legacy fund at charity SAYiT soon afterwards. The money pays for counselling services and a financial hardship fund. The charity said it has had more requests for help as many teens are without their usual support networks.   Heather Paterson, from the charity, said: ""The young people we work with may not be out at home, or they may not feel that they are understood.  ""The support they get around that from their peer group, from youth groups like us, or from college perhaps, isn't available to them at the moment.""   Noah's mother, Claire McGettigan, said her son was a proud member of the LGBT+ community and was also autistic, with mental health issues.  ""He came out to us when he was about 12 or 13. It's never been an issue, why would it be?"" she said.  ""He was gay and he wouldn't let anybody not have the right to be heard. He would do absolutely anything to fight someone's corner. ""I think SAYiT has adjusted how they use the money. It is now being used for more emergency reasons, things like internet access or mobile phones for people,"" she added.

Surge testing for Covid variant begins in town,"Surge testing has begun after ""a very small number"" of cases of the South African variant were found in part of Norfolk. People in Diss and the nearby village of Roydon have been urged to get a Covid-19 test, regardless of whether they have symptoms.  It was hoped 10,000 would be tested in the next two weeks, Norfolk County Council's public health team said. Testing can being carried out at mobile units or with a kit at home. The council said a ""very small number"" of people in the Diss and Roydon area had tested positive with the South African variant, and they were all self-isolating. A council spokesman said it was ""government policy to bring in surge testing for any cases that can't be linked explicitly to foreign travel, regardless of how small the number is"". Mike Pursehouse, from South Norfolk Council's corporate management leadership team, said it was an exercise in logistics. ""We have a strong team - South Norfolk Council put the boots on the ground... Norfolk County Council with public health doing the infrastructure, a huge array of NHS staff,"" he said. ""The police are working with us to keep us safe as well, so [in total] we've got 25 staff a day in Diss and Roydon."" The programme involves PCR Covid-19 tests, which, unlike lateral-flow testing, means swabs are sent to a lab in Thetford for analysis. The authorities hoped the results would give a detailed picture of how the South African variant arrived in the area, and how it was spreading.

"Vaccine passports could discriminate, experts warn","By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  Covid-19 vaccine passports are ""feasible"" but not until we know more about how long immunity lasts, experts have said.  And they have the potential to discriminate against the young, pregnant or those who can't have the jab for medical reasons. This must be factored into any such scheme before launching, according to a Royal Society report. It sets out 12 tests which should be met by any vaccine passport plan. The criteria include having a way of accommodating ""changes in vaccine efficacy against emerging variants"". And a vaccine passport would need to meet ethical and legal standards including around data protection, human rights and equality and discrimination laws. It is also vital to be clear about what the passports would be used for, whether that's international travel or greater domestic freedoms, the report outlined.   The main scientific issues are around how long immunity lasts and whether vaccines will protect against new variants.  It's difficult to say how long a vaccine passport should be valid for if it's not known how long the protection conferred by the jabs hang around for. And it will need to be clear whether all the vaccines in use protect against every new variant - especially if people are travelling to parts of the world where the dominant strain is different from the one in their home country. The vaccine is proving to be very good at protecting people from becoming ill with coronavirus. But there are still questions around how much it stops people carrying the virus and transmitting it to others. Understanding this will be important if vaccination status becomes a pass to mix more freely with others, Prof Christopher Dye, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford who contributed to the report, explained. He said the only vaccine currently mandated for travel around the world is yellow fever - and there is only one type of vaccine available, it's highly effective, and confers lifelong protection.  The Covid-19 vaccines are not currently in such a ""comfortable"" spot, he said. As well as scientific concerns, there are also legal and ethical considerations, according to the report's lead author Prof Melinda Mills.   ""What would it be used for - getting a job or attending a football match or buying milk?"" she questioned. ""What if we start barring people from essential goods and services?"" ""There is a risk of unjustly discriminating in hiring, attending events, insurance, housing applications, you can think of many examples,"" Prof Mills explained.  If a passport scheme was rolled out before everyone in the country has been offered a jab, this could unfairly disadvantage young people or people living in certain parts of the country.  Even then, some people are unable to or are not recommended to take the vaccine, for medical reasons or during pregnancy unless they are at particular risk, for example. And, ""people of different ethnicities have different levels of vaccine hesitancy,"" Prof Mills said, which opens up the potential for discrimination against people's ""religious or political beliefs"" - or where this hesitancy is linked to a long history of racism and marginalisation.  If employers implement ""no jab, no job"" policies - where the requirement to be vaccinated is written into workers' contracts - equality laws would need to be balanced with legal duties of care, Prof Mills said. For example, the right of individuals working in care homes to choose not to be vaccinated would have to be balanced against the imperative to protect the vulnerable in their care.  Some countries have already developed passport schemes, including Estonia, Denmark and Israel. The 12 tests outlined by the Royal Society recommend that a vaccine passport should:",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56125142,1

Johnson still working on lockdown-easing 'roadmap',"Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to spend the weekend finalising his ""roadmap"" for easing Covid restrictions in England and opening up the economy. The government is ""crunching the numbers"" ahead of Monday's announcement, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said. New data is expected to suggest vaccines have cut transmission rates. But Downing Street has refused to comment on the likely contents of the unlocking plan amid press speculation. The prime minister has said his top priority will be the re-opening of schools. The government has long planned to get all pupils in England back to the classroom on 8 March - but teachers' unions say the return may need to be ""staggered"" to allow for Covid testing. Ministers are also under pressure to re-open pubs, restaurants, shops and the tourism industry - but scientists are warning against a swift return to relative ""normality"". Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out plans for easing restrictions ""in as much detail as he is able"" in his long-awaited ""roadmap"" statement to Parliament on Monday. ""But we cannot give guarantees, because that is not how viruses work,"" he added. ""Ultimately we want to open up society, the economy, as much as we are able, but only on the condition that it is safe to do so."" Mr Cleverly would not be drawn on whether the government could allow holidays to take place at home and abroad this summer, saying: ""We are assessing the numbers."" The devolved nations of the UK have the power to set their own restrictions, and have been moving at different speeds: By Philippa Roxby, health reporter Now that more than 16 million of the UK's most vulnerable have been vaccinated, the next step is to find out the impact. Less than 10 weeks after the programme began, there are hints in data on over-80s in England that deaths in that age group are falling more quickly than in other age groups. This was always the hope - that vaccines would prevent people dying and becoming seriously ill in the oldest first, reducing pressure on hospitals and protecting those most at risk. The impact of vaccines on numbers infected may not change for a while yet though - that depends on how good the vaccines are at stopping the spread of the virus, which was always more uncertain, although the signs from early studies are promising. In any case, lockdown restrictions appear to be having their own impact with infections falling every two weeks. When analysed alongside how hospitals are coping and figures on new variants, politicians will then have the difficult task of deciding on the path ahead. A further 12,057 Covid cases were reported across the UK on Thursday, down from a daily peak of more than 60,000 in January. Another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported, from a high of more than 1,800 in January. And more than 17 million people in the UK have now received at least one dose of a Oxford/AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. But concerns are high over the rapid spread, worldwide, of new coronavirus strains. The Daily Telegraph is reporting that government figures - due to be published soon - will show the jabs have cut UK transmissions and infections by two thirds. Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose modelling prompted the first English lockdown, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK could be ""a very different country"" by the end of May. He added: ""We will still have rules in place butâ¦ I think society will be a lot more normal."" Prof Ferguson said two key bits of data - the infection rate and the effectiveness of vaccines - were ""looking promising"", but it would take ""quite a long time"" to assess the situation fully. Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said it was still not clear what effect injections were having on overall coronavirus transmission. Most people immunised so far were ""elderly"", he said, and ""not mixing that much within the population"".",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56123889,1
The scheme to share unused vaccines with other countries,"Vaccines are seen as the best way of enabling the world to return to some sense of normality.  A scheme called Covax aims to ensure they are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor.  The UK is among those offering money and unused doses, but some say it is not enough. The coronavirus pandemic has destroyed livelihoods and claimed the lives of more than two million people worldwide.  So far, richer countries have been able to buy far more Covid jabs than poorer ones. Covax hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as 98 wealthier countries. The scheme is led by the World Health Organization (WHO) and also involves the Global Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi).  Covax has raised $6bn (Â£4.3bn), but the scheme says it needs at least another $2bn (Â£1.4bn) to meet its target for 2021. The UK government has provided $734m (Â£548m) and the US pledged $4bn (Â£2.93bn) in December.  One of President Biden's first acts in office was to sign up the US to Covax. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has said it will donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries. France's President Emmanuel Macron has said richer countries should send up to 5% of their current vaccine supplies to poorer nations. The lower income countries most likely to receive the first vaccines include Afghanistan, Haiti, DR Congo, Ethiopia and Somalia.  Although most of the first doses available will be delivered to low- and middle-income countries, some will be sent to high-income countries such as Canada, which has defended its decision to draw on Covax's early supply. The WHO has approved the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, giving it the green light for it to be rolled out globally through Covax. Gavi says it has an agreement for 340 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and about 1.2 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. It hopes to begin rolling them out in March.  Health care workers are expected to be first in line to receive them. Some people say Covax has not moved quickly enough. One WHO board member, Austria's Dr Clemens Martin Auer, said it had been slow to secure vaccine deals and deliver doses to countries. Vaccines produced in the UK, US, Europe, Russia and China are already being widely used, having been bought up and approved in countries around the world.  But doses are not shared equally between countries. ""Rich nations representing just 14% of the world's population had bought up more than half (53%) of all the most promising vaccines,"" a campaign group called The People's Vaccine Alliance said in December.   High-income countries currently hold a confirmed 4.2 billion doses, while low-middle income nations hold 670 million, according to research by the Duke Global Health Innovation Center. Even if Covax's target is met, it would still fall short of the level of immunity that experts say is needed to end the pandemic. The WHO has suggested that stopping Covid-19 will require at least 70% of the global population to have immunity. At a rate of two billion doses per year, it could take years to vaccinate 70% of the world's estimated 7.8 billion people. However, two billion doses would give some protection to those who are first in line, such as health workers, the elderly and the vulnerable.

NHS worker dies with Covid 'before reaching dream',"A ""bubbly"" NHS worker has died with Covid-19 before he was able to achieve his dream of working as a registered mental health nurse.  Oronsaye Okhomina, 56, from Manchester, who was also known as Jeff or Orons, died on 11 February. His final exam results were released in January while he was in a coma so he was never able to use his qualification. His wife Esther said ""he had worked so hard"" but his life was ""snatched away"". ""He was my everything,"" she said, adding: ""Without him I felt breathless, my solid rock, always standing by through thick and thin, always my source of inspiration, my God on earth."" Mr Okhomina was born in Benin City, Nigeria, and moved to the Netherlands in 1990 before arriving in the UK in 2005. The father-of-four had originally worked in IT, gaining a degree and masters at the University of Bradford, but decided he wanted to help mental health patients. He had worked as a student nurse and mental health support worker for almost 10 years and had taken his final qualifications to become a registered mental health nurse in December. He was ""looking forward to"" working with Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Trust, Ms Okhomina said.   She said he had worked so hard ""with all his strength and will"" but ""after he had fulfilled all the requirements...he never had the opportunity to practise as a qualified nurse for even one day"". ""The cold hands of death snatched him away from us all,"" she said.  Mr Okhomina's friend Babajide Lawal-Shekoni, 41, said: ""If I'm down he'd pick me up... I know he was that kind of person to a lot of people as well. ""He said 'I'm not feeling too well' so I told him to call the ambulance, and that was it... there was no time."" Mr Lawal-Shekoni said his friend was ""a fun person"". ""There was never a dull moment - a bubbly character. I miss him a lot.""  Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Dental schools will not take new students,"Scotland's dental schools will not admit new students in September due to existing trainees having to repeat the academic year. It was announced last week that dental students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience during the Covid pandemic.  Graduations of final year students were postponed and all others were told they would have to repeat a year. Universities Scotland said this would mean no new students this year. A spokesman said: ""Dentistry is an area which has been particularly badly hit by the Covid pandemic, due to the risk of spread of the virus via aerosol transmission. This has severely limited clinical training. ""All applicants who interviewed for September 2021 entry will still receive a final decision on their interview by 20th May 2021 but any offers made this year will be for a deferred start date of September 2022.   ""Our sympathies go out to these incoming students who, like so many people, are having their life plans severely disrupted."" Scotland's dental schools previously said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs) which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for dental students at Dundee and Glasgow universities will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the academic year. The same will happen at Aberdeen but final year students will only be deferred until Christmas. Savanna Joyce, 28, from Orkney, is a final year dental student at the University of Aberdeen.  Her graduation has been deferred until December - it's a decision she said she knew was coming. The reality, however, was still overwhelming.  ""Everybody in our year understands that patient safety is the priority, and despite being disheartened we all agree it's the right decision,"" she said.  She conceded that the dental school being closed ""did have quite an impact"" on learning, as practical work was not possible.  And there had been a financial impact too - she ran out of money this year, and had to take on a job alongside her degree. ""Without the promise of support, I wouldn't have been able to stay on,"" she said.  Ms Joyce said: ""I wouldn't have felt safe going out this year. Covid has impacted us so much - we've had far less clinical experience so I'm glad that it's extended.  ""We are all very accepting of the decisions,"" she added.  The British Dental Association Scotland had warned the lack of new students could lead to far more competition for training places. They said it could translate into major problems for the NHS workforce that could be felt for years to come. David McColl, from the British Dental Association, said it would be very disappointing for people hoping to take up a place at dental school this year. ""What we said to the Scottish government was that we need to put something in place,"" he said. ""We just can't defer them for a year without them being included within dentistry in some shape or form. ""If they are keen we want to keep them involved in dentistry."" At Friday's lunchtime coronavirus briefing, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said it was an ""inevitable and pragmatic decision"" to extend the training programme of existing dental students. He said: ""I am confident there will be the ability for new dental students to be able to secure places and to be able to take forward their dental training."" Mr Swinney said he would be discussing the issues with the dental schools and the British Dental Association.

Prince praises isles NHS staff in call with nurse,"Prince William has thanked NHS Western Isles' staff for their efforts during the Covid pandemic. William, known as the Earl of Strathearn in Scotland, praised their work in a phone call with Frances MacNeil, a charge nurse on Barra. Barra and neighbouring Vatersay have been in lockdown since 20 January following a serious Covid outbreak, which has since been declared over. Ms MacNeil has been involved in the Western Isles' vaccination programme. She said: ""Prince William was very knowledgeable about the vaccination programme and the geography of the islands.  ""He asked about the logistics of getting the vaccine to the islands and how we were managing.  ""We spoke a little about the challenges of unpredictable weather and reaching people in their own homes."" Ms MacNeil added: ""He commented that, of course, so many people had been unable to leave their homes during the past year because of the pandemic.""  Prince William has been involved in a series of phone calls and online meetings with health care staff, charity workers and military personnel since the start of the pandemic. Barra and Vatersay moved from level three to level four restrictions after 40 positive tests on Barra. With about 140 people self-isolating at the time, the outbreak had affected as much as 16% of the population of Barra. Islanders had observed a voluntary lockdown on Barra as part of the community's efforts to suppress the virus. About a week after Barra and Vatersay entered level four, the whole of the Western Isles went into lockdown after a number of new outbreaks, including at the isles' largest hospital - Western Isles Hospital in Stornoway, Lewis. NHS Western Isles said it had been 14 days since the last positive case in the Barra outbreak.

Where does the government borrow billions from?,"The UK government is borrowing record-breaking amounts, to pay for measures designed to limit the impact of coronavirus. Initiatives such as the furlough scheme are expensive and government income is down because lower wages and spending mean people are paying less tax. The government borrows because it spends more than it gets in income.  Most of its income comes from taxes - for example, income tax from your pay cheque or the VAT you pay on certain goods.  It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes - and in some years that has happened. But governments have not always been willing to increase taxes enough to cover their spending. This is partly for political reasons - it would be unpopular with voters.  There are also other reasons for not raising taxes. If higher taxes leave people with less money to spend, it can be bad for economic growth and jobs. The amount the government borrows to make up the difference between what it spends and what it collects is known as ""public sector net borrowing"".  It is also often referred to as ""the deficit"". The latest data shows that the UK government borrowed Â£8.8bn in January, which was the the highest January figure since monthly records began in 1993, It has been estimated that borrowing could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. The government borrows money by selling bonds. A bond is a promise to make payments to whoever holds it on certain dates. There is a large payment on the final date - in effect, the repayment.  Interest is also paid to whoever owns the bond in the meantime. So it's basically an interest-paying ""IOU"". The buyers of these bonds, or ""gilts"", are mainly financial institutions, like pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies.  Private savers also buy some.  Some also end up being bought by the Bank of England as part of its current attempts to boost spending and investment in the economy. Under this policy - known as ""quantitative easing"" - the Bank has so far bought Â£875bn of government bonds. Government bonds appeal to investors as they are seen as essentially safe - there is no risk that the money won't be paid.  You won't lose your money and you know precisely when and how much the payments will be. It varies a lot.  Some government borrowing has to be repaid in a month, but some lending is for as long as 30 years.  The minimum repayment period is just one day, while some bonds have been issued for 55 years.  There used to be some government debt which never had to be repaid, sometimes known as perpetual bonds. But the government chose to repay the last of these in 2015. The deficit is the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends each year. It covers most of this gap by borrowing, or sometimes by selling assets such as property.  In years when a government spends less than its income, it is known as a surplus.  The deficit is not to be confused with debt, although both are linked. Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. So it's a much larger sum.  Debt rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  In January 2020, it was Â£2.11 trillion, up Â£316.4bn since the start of the financial year. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK economy, with debt having reached 97.9% of the UK's gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the sum (measured in pounds) of the value of goods and services produced in the economy. Debt levels as high as this haven't been seen since the early 1960s when the UK was paying off the debts of World War Two. The government does repay debt on due dates, but usually has to borrow new money - and take on more debt - to do so.   What does a billion pounds look like?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50504151,1
"'Vital' children return to classrooms, says Weir","The education minister has said it is ""vital"" that all children return to school, but broader public health must be considered when making decisions. Pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to three will return to classrooms on 8 March. They will then resume remote learning on 22 March to enable the return of pupils in years 12 to 14 until the start of the Easter holidays. The return to classroom learning has been welcomed by school leaders. The vast majority of pupils in Northern Ireland have been learning remotely since Christmas. Peter Weir said the youngest pupils will return first as they are least likely to transmit the virus. Students doing qualifications like GCSEs, AS, A-levels (in years 12 to 14) and other vocational qualifications like BTEC will return to face-to-face teaching from 22 March. But pupils in years 4 to 7 in primary and years 8 to 11 in post-primary will not be back in school until after the Easter break at the earliest. ""In terms of the logic of the ordering, for the very young pupils we know they are the lowest risk of transmutability but also, it is very difficult for very young pupils to engage in a level of remote learning,"" the minister told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""For those key examination years there is a need for a period of assessment and preparation for that and that's why those two groups have been given that level of prioritisation. ""I would ideally like to see the situation where everybody is back on the 8th, but clearly there are concerns from the broader public health point of view, from the Department of Health, and therefore it's about the executive following that health advice."" Mr Weir said that schools provide ""very safe places"" for students, but the ""return to schools actually has wider behavioural impacts within society"". The minister acknowledged that while some parents will be ""relieved and glad"" at the decision, not everyone is happy. ""There will be others in the groups who aren't immediately going back who will have a sense of frustration and disappointment and I think we do need to, as a society, meet that challenge in a constructive manner and get everybody back,"" he said. Kirsty Andrews, principal of Tullygally Primary in Craigavon, County Armagh, said she was happy that more of her pupils will be back in school but she still has many questions. Like many schools, Tullygally Primary has remained open throughout lockdown for the children of key workers and vulnerable children. ""My staff have worked very hard with online learning but I think that children learn better when they're in school and when they're face-to-face,"" Ms Andrews told BBC News NI. ""While I welcome the idea that it's going to be face-to-face teaching and we're going to get away from online learning, what do we do whenever parents ask us: 'How come it's safe for my child to go into P3 but it's not safe for my child to go into P5?' She would like teachers to be given priority for vaccinations as more pupils go back to class, but said schools also need a plan they can stick to. ""We do need to have a clear path out of this - we don't want to open, shut, open, shut, open, shut because that's not good for anybody,"" she said.  The Irish National Teachers Organisation (INTO) said that ""the phased return to schools from the executive has posed as many questions as answers"". But the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said it was ""very sensible and logical"" to open schools on a phased basis. ASCL's regional officer in Northern Ireland, Robert Wilson, said that allowing the youngest pupils to return first was a sensible first step. ""For those in secondary education who would have faced important examinations this summer, the planned return to the classroom on 22 March is very important, although the timing just a week before the start of the Easter holiday is debatable,"" he said. ""Our exam-age pupils in particular have suffered a difficult and distressing year of disruption and lost learning. ""What is crucial is that pupils return in a way which is safe and sustainable, and which inspires the confidence of education staff and the public."" Mr Wilson also called on the executive to give teachers priority for Covid-19 vaccination. Teachers' union NASUWT said the phased return was ""the basis of a good plan to get children back to school"". However, Justin McCamphill told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme there are concerns over exam year pupils going into school. ""We see that the [education] minister has said that all exam year pupils go in, our view is they only really should be going in if they need to carry out assessments,"" he said. ""We want to know what the Department of Education is going to do to ensure all risk assessments in schools are updated, that control measures are reinforced, that we have proper ventilation, that we have social distancing in place and those measures should now be more achievable when there are fewer pupils in the schools.""

James Newman named as 2021 UK Eurovision entrant,"By Steve HoldenNewsbeat music reporter James Newman is getting another shot at Eurovision, after being reselected to represent the UK for the 2021 contest in the Netherlands.  The singer-songwriter was chosen last year but the pandemic forced the event to be cancelled for the first time. His new song will be revealed at a later date but he's promising something ""positive and upbeat"". ""I need to finish what I started,"" James tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I was so gutted when it got cancelled last year, and I didn't get the opportunity to go to Rotterdam and sing on stage. I instantly wanted to take part again."" The contest is due to take place 18-22 May at Rotterdam's Ahoy! venue. James joins loads of other competitors from Eurovision's class of 2020 who will be returning in 2021, including Iceland's Daoi Freyr (you can see the full list below). Eurovision bosses have a series of scenarios in place to make sure the event goes ahead this year, no matter how severely the pandemic is affecting the participating countries. It means James will definitely compete, even if any travel restrictions remain in place.  He'll either perform in person in Rotterdam or remotely from the UK.  James loves a ballad but he says it ""didn't feel right"" this year. The new song's expected to be revealed in a few weeks. ""I feel like everyone wants a party and to have some fun so when I was writing, that's what I had in my head. I wanted something people can dance to, even if it's just in their kitchen"". James is a successful pop songwriter and has written for acts including Ed Sheeran and Jess Glynne, and is the older brother of John Newman.  ""The whole songwriting process has obviously been a little bit different. I've had to adapt to writing in a slightly different way because everything has been online. ""I took it slowly over the summer and then started writing in the autumn, thinking about what to do after the hard times."" James says the best thing about his Eurovision experience last year was the ""fan community"" that surrounds the contest.  ""Those fans brought me into the Eurovision world. Everyone is so welcoming. I knew the basics of Eurovision but didn't realise how many people lived and breathed it."" Following a last-place finish in 2019, the UK's Eurovision team at the BBC embarked on a new strategy, partnering with record company BMG to help select the act and song.  The focus switched from a public vote to an internal selection. In 2020, James was the artist and My Last Breath was the song - but he never got to perform it.  After ruling out a full scale show, Eurovision bosses have certain scenarios in place to ensure the contest goes ahead. DaÃ°i Freyr was the overwhelming favourite to win last year's contest and is back to represent a country which has never won the contest.  His song, Think About Things, got spots on the Radio 1 and Radio 2 playlists and was used in Strictly Come Dancing's promo campaign.  DaÃ°i has already asked for members of the public to join a virtual choir on his 2021 Eurovision track, meaning he has his eyes on a win in 2021.  With Iceland being the focus of Netflix's Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga movie as well, there's a lot of weight on his shoulders to bring home the title.   Tears Getting Sober was another favourite to win in 2020. The low-key Billie Eilish-style ballad showcased Victoria's soft and subtle vocals, Her return to Eurovision was announced last March, and has continued to have success in her home country, scoring a number one with her track Ugly Cry. The Mamas won last year's Melodifestivalen (Melfest) - Sweden's legendary Eurovision selection show - and have entered again this year. The group, who started off as backing singers, won a close 2020 Melfest final. Their entry Move won by a single point.  To get their second chance at Eurovision (or third if you include their appearance as backing singers for John Lundvik), they will have to beat 27 other artists in the televised finals. They're competing against Dotter, who came second last year, as well as 1999 Eurovision winner Charlotte Perrelli.

Bass player 'who lost everything' opens cafe,"A bass guitarist turned pop-up cafe owner says she will solely employ musicians that have been affected by the pandemic. Bristol musician Lianna Lee Davies opened LD's CafÃ© for takeaways after she and her partner lost their livelihoods due to Covid restrictions. Music creators like Miss Davies have faced losses of up to two-thirds of their income during the outbreak. She said the cafe had helped her to ""take back control"" of her finances. After ""falling through the cracks"", unable to get Covid-related financial aid from the government, she began teaching online music courses. She started doing that to supplement her loss of income when Turbowolf, the psychedelic-rock band she plays in, had to stop performing because of Covid-related restrictions on live gigs.  However the bass guitarist said she found it ""stressful"" and had to stop that too, leaving her, her partner and her child without any funds coming in. She said: ""We couldn't get furlough or a government self-employment grant so we slipped through the cracks and lost everything. ""I just felt that there's no point in sitting around and waiting for the government to decide on what I can and can't do, so I took control of the situation for my family and it luckily worked. ""Because of Brexit, the likelihood of musicians being able to sustainably make money and tour is getting lower and lower.""  ""I want to be an employer where musicians have a job to come back to in between gigs and touring when everything starts up again,"" she added. Musician Blake Davies (no relation to Leanna Lee Davies) is a drummer from Bristol who said when the pandemic hit he took temporary jobs with Amazon and Tesco but was not getting paid ""anywhere near"" what he was earning when he was performing. He said working at the cafÃ© with other musicians has been a ""lifeline"" for him. He said: ""Now that I'm around like-minded people throughout the day it has definitely helped my mental health. ""At the start of the pandemic, I had completely written-off being able to play music again for a while so instead I wanted to help on the frontline but things just started getting harder and harder for me, it's definitely been a struggle.""

Do doctors and nurses have enough protective gear?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives.   With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling for more kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE.  The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk.  Guidelines say all hospital staff should wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering.  Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks, are not classed as PPE as they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection.  Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors.  That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing.  Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure.  Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations like cleaners, mortuary workers and members of the prison service may need to use PPE and should follow guidelines.  The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock.  The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE.  Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion itemshave been delivered to the health and social care system in England. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves.  A breakdown of PPE delivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: Since March, more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered in the NHS in Scotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: Since March, nearly 630 million items of PPE have been delivered to the health and social care sectors in Wales. In the week to 20 December, this included: In Northern Ireland, more than 376.5 million items of PPE were sent between March and the end of January 2021.  In the week to 27 November, this included: Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients.  All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages, guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit.  For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused.  The Royal College of Nursing and the British Medical Association say PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE.  UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care.  The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"".",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-52254745,1
Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.  With the UK having ordered more than 400 million doses of various coronavirus vaccines, it's expected to have many left over once all adults have been offered jabs. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson will pledge to donate a majority of that surplus to poorer countries in a speech to fellow leaders of rich nations in the G7 later. Primary pupils aged eight and over may be able to return to school in Wales from 15 March, if Covid cases continue to fall. Children aged between three and seven are due back in class on Monday and First Minister Mark Drakeford will later announce proposals for the return of more pupils. However, stay-at-home lockdown rules are expected to stay in place for another three weeks. Nearly 20 major healthcare bodies are appealing to the PM for better masks and other personal protection against coronavirus - saying current measures to stop airborne spread of the disease are ""inadequate"". They say at least 930 health and care workers have died of Covid-19 and more are experiencing long-term effects. The government says safety is a priority, it's monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and will update advice ""where necessary"". More than two million people have not been refunded for flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, and many may not be entitled to one, according to the Which? consumer group.

Health workers appeal to PM for better PPE,"Nearly 20 major healthcare bodies are appealing to the PM for better personal protection against coronavirus. They say at least 930 health and care workers have died of Covid-19 and more are experiencing long-term effects.  In a letter, they say measures to stop airborne spreading are ""inadequate"" and call for urgent improvement in masks and other defences against variants.  The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"". The organisations involved represent a wide range of health professionals, from doctors and nurses to dieticians and physiotherapists.  Their approach to Downing Street follows repeated efforts to raise the issue with others in government. With health and care workers at three to four times greater risk of becoming infected than the general public, the plea to Boris Johnson is to make an ""urgent intervention to prevent further loss of life"". It says current policies focus on contaminated surfaces and droplets - for which the best defences are hand hygiene and social distancing - but not on airborne transmission by tiny infectious aerosols. ""There is now no scientific doubt,"" the letter states, ""that Covid-19 spreads via the airborne route."" ""The evidence is clear - and lives continue to be put at risk."" The groups are demanding: Dame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that nurses needed better protection when working with patients outside of intensive care units - such as in homes and open wards. ""While we've taken care of one area, people are unnecessarily exposed,"" she said. ""We need a different approach that recognises the evidence. There is no point in [the UK's four chief medical officers] saying that 'we're writing this guidance all together' if the guidance doesn't adequately protect the people that are working on the front line day in and day out, and we believe it doesn't."" One of the organisations involved, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, says its members routinely have to spend time close to Covid patients.  Chief executive Kamini Gadhok told BBC News: ""I'm shocked. I feel quite distraught from it all. ""People are dying - and there is this stonewalling in the context of this being a life-threatening virus. ""Not being heard for so long is incredibly distressing."" It's hard to keep track of the number of appeals and letters leading healthcare organisations have produced in their efforts to secure safer conditions. And it's not often seasoned health professionals end up in tears when talking about this. But months of trying to persuade the powers that be to routinely allow a higher grade of personal protection equipment (PPE) for all staff dealing with Covid patients have got nowhere.  One result is an increasing sense among front-line staff of fear about the dangers they face, and of alienation from those deciding the policy on infection control. Another is that all over the UK, there are growing numbers of hospitals and ambulance trusts quietly going their own way, providing better equipment regardless of the official guidelines. There's a more fundamental point as well - with a division between those who insist the virus can be held at bay mainly by hand hygiene and droplet control, and those who look at the research into aerosols and judge enough is known to recognise a real risk.   Initially, the concern was many of the staff's tasks - assessing the ability to swallow, for example - were likely to cause coughs and therefore aerosols. But as the pandemic unfolded, and more research emerged into how the virus could spread, a broader worry surfaced about being in poorly ventilated rooms for long periods protected by only a surgical mask.  A government spokesman said the safety of NHS and social care staff is a priority and that because good ventilation can reduce the risk, there's guidance on it for businesses and health and care settings.  ""The government will continue to closely monitor new and emerging evidence on airborne transmission, and update our advice where necessary,"" he said.

Macron: Send 4-5% of vaccines to poorer nations,"French President Emmanuel Macron has called on Europe and the US to urgently send up to 5% of their coronavirus vaccine supplies to developing nations. Mr Macron told the Financial Times the failure to share vaccines fairly would entrench global inequality. The vast majority of vaccinations have been administered by high-income countries so far. Mr Macron proposed his plan to address the imbalance ahead of a G7 virtual summit of world leaders on Friday. The White House has said US President Joe Biden will announce a pledge of $4bn (Â£2.8bn) in funding for a global vaccine-sharing scheme, known as Covax. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson - who will chair the meeting - is expected to dedicate surplus doses to Covax. To date, at least 110 million people have been infected with the virus worldwide and more than 2.4 million have died, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. ""We're not talking about billions of doses immediately, or billions and billions of euros,"" Mr Macron told the FT.  ""It's about much more rapidly allocating 4-5% of the doses we have. ""It won't change our vaccination campaigns, but each country should set aside a small number of the doses it has to transfer tens of millions of them, but very fast, so that people on the ground see it happening."" Mr Macron said German Chancellor Angela Merkel supported a European vaccine-sharing initiative, adding that he hoped to win the backing of the US as well. In the absence of such a scheme, China and Russia were filling the gap, ""paving the way for a war of influence over vaccines"", Mr Macron said. On Wednesday, United Nations Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres denounced the ""wildly uneven and unfair"" global distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. He said just 10 countries had administered 75% of all vaccinations worldwide, while 130 countries had not yet received a single dose. Richer nations have been accused of hoarding vaccines at the expense of poorer ones. Some high-income nations, such as the UK and Canada, have ordered enough doses to vaccinate their populations more than once. Health experts say that, unless vaccines are shared more equitably, it could be years before coronavirus is brought under control at a global level. But at this week's virtual meeting of the G7 - a club of seven leading economic powers - world leaders are expected to acknowledge the vaccine deficit between high- and low-income nations.

"'There was no wildlife, there was nothing'","By Catherine LeeBBC News It was a rapidly-spreading virus, with stringent measures taken to contain its transmission. It delayed elections and had a huge economic impact. Sound familiar? On 19 February 2001 a case of foot-and-mouth disease was discovered at an abattoir in Essex.  By the time the outbreak was declared over it had spread across the British countryside and more than six million sheep, cattle and pigs had been slaughtered. There had been major disruption nationally and, although the disease did not leap to humans, the overall cost to the UK economy was estimated at Â£8bn. As with the current coronavirus crisis, there was criticism of the government for not shutting things down quickly enough, and in the early stages complaints of a shortage of equipment and resources.  Peter Frost-Pennington was a semi-retired vet who volunteered to help out in the unfolding crisis and was told to report to the operation centre in Carlisle. He said: ""I had my own boots, waterproofs and a thermometer, literally, there was nothing in stores. I had to bring my own bucket and brush; my own PPE effectively. ""It was only later [the government] opened the chequebook and also brought in the army."" He described aspects of his work as ""hugely upsetting"", having to slaughter animals when normally his job would be to save them. ""At one point I worked for 23 hours in a row culling infected animals"", he said. ""But I just took a deep breath and did my duty, like I'm sure people on the front line are doing now."" One incident stood out; an infected farm where the young son had hand-reared a Highland calf which he was hoping would win a prize at a show the following week. ""He was trying to hide it in his bedroom,"" Mr Frost-Pennington said. ""So I had to go in there and, as gently as possible, take it away from him.  ""And then I had to kill it."" The crisis brought out the ""best and worst of humanity"", the vet said. ""Sometimes it was a difficult job getting the message across to farmers that it was a very virulent disease and the infected animal was really dangerous. ""They might shout at me, and I can't say I'd blame them. ""But there was also this time when I'd been on a farm for three days, slaughtering their entire herd of lovely pedigree dairy cows, and amongst all that they sent a bouquet of flowers to my wife because they knew I hadn't been able to get home. ""I couldn't believe their kindness, it was a wonderful thing."" Then, as now, there was social isolation and a toll on people's mental health. Bruce Jobson, who was then a Northumberland dairy farmer, said: ""A lot of farmers have still not got over it. ""They refuse to talk about it because of the sheer horrendous conditions they endured.  ""Animals were culled and left lying dead in the farmyards and the farmers just had to stay there because they couldn't leave until everyone was gone and the animals had been taken away for disposal.  ""It was horrific."" Kevin Holliday, who farms near Calderbridge in West Cumbria, said: ""My children, then aged nine and 14, were unable to travel to school due to foot-and-mouth all around and we decided to send them away as full-time boarders. ""So we were on our own up here just [my wife] and I, and you know there's a saying 'a problem shared is a problem halved'? Well if you've got nobody to share it with because you're all alone and isolated then it takes some stomaching. ""You've got to have some bottle to keep things going."" His daughter Vicky added: ""I remember seeing on the farm next to the school people with the suits on obviously taking the animals away to kill them. ""It will haunt me for the rest of my life."" Penrith dairy farmer Claire Bland had to contend with the slaughter of all the farm's cattle.  She said: ""The army came in and began the killing. We heard the first cattle bolt go, and then we just went inside.  ""Afterwards, the countryside was just so quiet, there was no wildlife, there was nothing. ""It was a very dark time."" Of the effects on mental health, she said: ""I think I haven't explored it completely. There's a box in there with a lot of foot-and-mouth information that I haven't gone through and I don't think I ever will."" Farmers whose animals were culled were given payouts by the government, but those affected less directly were unable to claim compensation. Julie Eakes, from Shipley in West Sussex, was a tenant farmer and having been given notice to quit the land had to get rid of her stock in one of the first farm sales after the outbreak.  She said: ""In normal years you'd have a good farm sale which would have given us the ability to move on, but this year no-one wanted to buy anything. ""All that herd we'd built up over 18 years, rearing from calves, all the breeding ewes, we just got about 10% of what we would have."" The family built up a farm business again, only to see the catering side which provided a ""massive part of the income"" collapse due to Covid restrictions. They have been unable to access an insurance payout. She said: ""It's devastating, brings back memories of foot-and-mouth and losing everything you've worked so hard for."" The tourism industry was also hard-hit in 2001 as exclusion zones in affected areas meant swathes of the countryside was off limits and public footpaths were closed. Cumbria was one of the worst affected areas, with the industry losing an estimated Â£260m. Fast forward to the present day, where the impact of Covid has been described as the equivalent of ""three winter seasons in a row"", and revenue is down by Â£2bn so far. Jim Walker, vice chair of Cumbria Tourism, said: ""It was a dreadful time for those involved - the farmers I talked to had a deeply personal investment in that way of life. ""It's the same now in the tourism economy. A lot of businesses are very small and family-owned and people sink their personal savings into them. ""With foot-and-mouth it was 'stop until it finished', but there is a stop-start nature to [Covid] which presents more uncertainty, more of a unknown way forward."" However, he remains hopeful for the future. ""After foot-and-mouth tourism did bounce back. The industry is very creative and innovative and we know there is massive pent-up demand, so there are opportunities as well as challenges."" An inquiry into the foot-and-mouth outbreak criticised the government's slowness to respond to the unfolding crisis and led to a major policy change in favour of vaccinating rather than slaughtering and burning animals. Anthony Gibson, former SW regional director of the National Farmers Union, described it as ""the biggest crisis in the Devon countryside, literally since the Civil War"", but is hopeful that it would not be repeated. He said: ""If we ever have an outbreak on the scale of the 2001 outbreak then vaccination would certainly play a key role. ""That would mean the countryside would not then have to be shut down in the way that is was in 2001, with all the damage to the wider economy and to tourism in particular.""

"Two million not given flight refunds, Which? says","By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter Millions of people are out of pocket on flights they were unable to board due to coronavirus restrictions, according to consumer group Which?. Holidaymakers prevented from flying by travel restrictions or lockdowns may not be entitled to a refund. More than two million people have not got their money back, Which? said. Travel restrictions remain in place in the UK, with travellers arriving from ""high-risk"" countries having to stay in quarantine hotels. Most of the people who were unable to take flights were hit by circumstances which meant they reasonably, or in some cases, legally, could not travel to their destination, Which? said. It is warning people to be wary of booking flights for this summer and to wait until the situation around international travel becomes clearer. The consumer group said in the longer-term booking a package holiday rather than a flight-only booking should give stronger passenger protections. People should only book with a trusted provider with a generous and flexible booking policy, it said. Travel restrictions introduced at the Spanish border on Christmas Eve meant the Howe family couldn't take their trip to Lanzarote. They were able to cancel their accommodation free of charge, but it was a different story with their flights. ""We asked for a refund, but was told as the flight was still operating, we weren't entitled,"" Rebecca Howe told the BBC. It has left the family Â£980 out of pocket, and they're far from alone in losing cash paid for flights. Hopeful holidaymakers have been prevented from travelling because of local or national lockdowns and restrictions preventing entry at their destination, or the Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office advising against non-essential travel. But in cases where the airline did not cancel the flight, customers may not be legally entitled to a refund or guaranteed a successful claim through their travel insurance or bank. Which? said passengers in these circumstances would often have only been given the choice of rebooking their flight or losing their money. Rebecca Howe said she was offered the choice to rebook her Ryanair flights for free up until the end of March, but that was no good. ""For one thing all the Ryanair flights to Lanzarote between Christmas and the end of March were less than half the price as we paid a premium to travel over New Year.  ""If we'd accepted a cheaper flight, we would have lost the difference."" But with the only practical date available for the family to go was February half-term, even that was no good. ""Someone at my work had already it booked as annual leave so I couldn't take the time off as we are only allowed one person out."" They're now trying to reclaim the money via a chargeback request through their bank, ""But there's no guarantee it'll be successful so at the moment we're accepting we have lost the money."" Donna Smullen and her husband from Cheshire had booked flights to Spain with Ryanair in September 2019, long before the start of the pandemic. They were due to travel in August 2020, but at the end of July, the FCDO warned against non-essential travel to Spain. That warning invalidates most travel insurance. A two-week quarantine was also introduced for flights returning from mainland Spain. Due to their jobs, quarantining was not an option for the couple.  ""We were told by Ryanair we could change the date of our flights for a fee of â¬30 to â¬90 (Â£26 to Â£78) per person per flight, as long as we travelled before the end of 2020,"" she said.  That meant rebooking would have been more expensive than the flights themselves, so they took the hit and were left more than Â£500 out of pocket. Ryanair said that passengers who book non-refundable flights are not entitled to refunds if they choose not to travel on flights which have operated.  However, passengers can avoid being out of pocket by ""availing of Ryanair's change facility, even for bookings which were made prior to any Covid-19 flight restrictions being introduced."" Which? has shared its findings with the CMA to aid an investigation into whether airlines have breached consumers' legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully take. Rory Boland, editor of Which? Travel, said: ""With non-essential travel currently illegal, airlines must play their part in protecting public health by ensuring no-one is left out of pocket for abiding by the law and not travelling. ""All airlines should allow passengers the option to cancel for a full refund, as well as fee-free rebooking options, while these restrictions remain in place.""

No Covid variants found on London Tubes and buses,"Monthly tests have found no traces of coronavirus, including new variants, in air samples and swabs of London's Tube trains, buses and stations. But this does not mean none is circulating or commuters can let down their guard, the researchers, at Imperial College London, say.  There has been extra cleaning through the pandemic, to combat spread from contaminated surfaces and breath. But commuters should continue to wear face coverings. Every month, since October, the researchers swab heavily touched areas, such as ticket barriers, stop buttons on buses, rails and handles on Tube trains and escalator handrails, from: And a machine that draws in about 300 litres (66 gallons) of air per minute checks for airborne virus.   The samples are sent the same day to Prof Wendy Barclay's lab so her team can study the genetic make-up of any coronavirus to detect any of the variants found elsewhere in the UK.  Having undergone changes to their spike protein, the part of the virus that attaches to human cells, these seem to be better at infecting cells and spreading.  And they may be mutating in ways that could make vaccines less effective against them. There is no evidence they cause much more serious illness for the vast majority infected.  As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. But some research suggests the new variant identified in the UK may be associated with a 30% higher risk of death. And the government has stepped up screening in areas where variants have been found, offering people door-to-door tests. But the work by the team at Imperial suggests even with new variants circulating in the UK, the risk of infection can be mitigated. Dr David Green, senior research fellow at Imperial, said: ""During the early stage of the pandemic, everybody was very concerned about washing their hands and touching surfaces.  ""As we've moved on, we are much more convinced that the routes of transmission tend to be through the air - through breathing, through being in confined environments, not maintaining social distancing or not wearing masks.  ""If you think about the London Underground environment and other transport networks, they are being cleaned very regularly and very thoroughly at the moment. ""The occupancy level is much lower. ""And everybody is wearing masks.  ""All of these things will reduce the chances of the virus being spread in these environments. ""Once a month, we do a journey that we feel reflects the type of journey that a commuter would take. ""So we travel from one Tube station to another. ""And we get on a bus and travel.  ""We tend to do the same route every month. ""So we get an idea of how things change over time, rather than try a scattergun approach across the entire network.  ""All of the results have been negative so far, which is very reassuring for everybody travelling.  ""But if we did get a positive result, then we could do further investigations into which particular variant it was.""

Ireland's Covid-19 lockdown 'could extend to May',"Strict Covid-19 restrictions could remain in place in the Republic of Ireland until early May, an Irish cabinet committee has heard.  But the return of some students to the classroom by March is on track. A recommendation on whether to carry on Level 5 restrictions has not been finalised, with the committee likely to meet again on Monday, RTÃ reports.  On Thursday the NI Executive confirmed that restrictions would be extended in Northern Ireland until 1 April.  A further 47 coronavirus-related deaths and 901 new cases were recorded in the Republic of Ireland, bringing the country's total number of deaths to 4,082. The plan to return junior infants, senior infants, first class and second class plus Leaving Certificate students to the classroom at the start of March was still on course, the cabinet's Covid-19 committee heard. It is likely to be followed by a gap of two to three weeks before other classes return, according to RTÃ. The final decision on schools is expected to be made on Tuesday. Earlier this week it was confirmed Irish pupils preparing to leave secondary school will have the option of a calculated grade or a written exam, a move Education Minister Norma Foley TD said would give students ""clarity and choice"". On Wednesday the Irish Cabinet has also signed off on  legislation to introduce mandatory hotel quarantine for some travellers coming into the country.

Lockdown partygoers locked themselves into venue,"Partygoers in north Wales padlocked themselves into an industrial unit to have a party, police say. North Wales Police responded to calls of a party at the unit off Ernest Street in Rhyl, Denbighshire, at around 20:00 GMT on Wednesday. Once inside, officers found ""music equipment set up with professional lighting, sofas and fridges full of alcohol for a birthday party"".   North Wales Police said it could have had ""disastrous consequences"". Fifteen people have been reported for breaching Covid regulations, and the business owner has been reported for organising an indoor event. When officers arrived they said they could hear loud music and numerous people inside. The only entry and exit to the unit had been padlocked shut. Police said the business owner refused to open the padlock and said there were 16 people present from different households - none were social distancing or wearing PPE.

Party house hit with closure order,"A closure order has been placed on a house where police say four parties were held in breach of Covid-19 rules. Last month, 18 people at the privately rented Knoll House, on Bury Road, Sewardstonebury in Essex, were hit with a total of nearly Â£15,000 in fines. It followed three other events, including one on New Year's Eve when about 100 people were present and there was evidence of drug use, police said. The order means no-one can live in the house or even enter it. Fines of Â£800 for anyone attending a house party of more than 15 people were introduced in England in January. After the most recent gathering at the Epping Forest property, on 30 January, Essex Police labelled those in attendance as ""selfish individuals"". Commenting on the closure order, which police said was granted after they applied to the courts, Ch Insp Antony Alcock explained that officers first became aware of the issues at Knoll House after a member of public alerted officers about the New Year's Eve gathering.

What do NI’s latest lockdown rules mean for you?,"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter Northern Ireland has been in lockdown for almost eight weeks and restrictions have now been extended again until the start of April. Stormont ministers say they want to keep driving down infection rates so that the eventual reopening is much more sustainable. BBC News NI explains what's behind those decisions, and what is set to change soon. The Stormont Executive backed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann to extend the bulk of restrictions for another four weeks. The measures were already in place until 5 March, but following a review ministers agreed ""reluctantly"" to keep them in place until 1 April. For now, that means many family gatherings remain prohibited, people must continue to work from home - in many cases - and should not leave their home without a ""reasonable excuse"", such as to buy food, medical supplies or take exercise. Although daily case numbers have been falling and pressure within hospitals is reducing, ministers have been advised that lifting restrictions now would undo much of the progress made in the past two months. First Minister Arlene Foster said there is also a ""growing concern"" about new variants of the virus, with the more transmissible Kent variant now thought to account for about 70% of Covid-19 cases in Northern Ireland. Stormont sources point to the Republic of Ireland, where restrictions were eased before Christmas and the emergence of the new variant led to a huge spike in cases - something the executive wants to avoid. They also want to prevent a rise in infections that could be caused by allowing people to meet up over traditional holidays - Mother's Day (14 March) and St Patrick's Day (17 March). They will review the lockdown restrictions again on 18 March, and if progress has continued by then, there is the possibility we could see some more slight easements. The picture is complex, but ministers plan to begin a phased return of some students from 8 March. That day will see children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) returning to classrooms. Students doing qualifications including GCSEs, AS, A-levels (in Years 12 to 14) and other vocational qualifications will return to face-to-face teaching from 22 March. The executive said in order to ensure that two large cohorts are not back before Easter, pre-school nursery years children and those in primary 1 to primary 3 will then have remote learning during the week of 22 March, before the Easter break. Ministers say their ""clear intention"" is to get all remaining students back into classrooms after Easter but they warn it has to be balanced with public health advice. Mrs Foster said having looked at medical evidence, transmission of the virus was higher among older children, but she added that those students who were due to sit exams - which have now been cancelled - need to be assessed for replacement grades, and needed to be given priority to return.  Children of key workers and vulnerable children who have been allowed to attend school during the lockdown will be permitted to continue attending even when the first face-to-face teaching resumes. At the moment, very little is changing on that front. People still can't meet others outside their own household indoors, unless they are part of a support bubble. Meeting up in private gardens isn't allowed either, but people can still take exercise with one other person outside their household. Gatherings in an outdoor public space are currently limited to six people from two households. But from 8 March, the executive says that will rise to 10 people from two households. The executive has extended restrictions to 1 April, the day before Easter holidays begin - but they say people should not get their hopes up for any major relaxations that weekend. Rather, ministers have warned that although the numbers are going in the right direction this will be ""a slow re-entry into normal life"". Finance Minister Conor Murphy said he didn't believe there would be any serious easing of restrictions around Easter and he advised people not to make plans. ""I would advise people not to be booking anything, not to be looking at 1 April as when everything opens up again,"" he said. Non-essential retail shops have to stay closed during the lockdown. But contactless click-and-collect services are being restored for some retailers from Monday 8 March. Currently only essential retailers such as supermarkets are allowed to offer click-and-collect. The executive has agreed to extend it to baby equipment shops, clothing shops, footwear shops and electrical goods shops.  Economy Minister Diane Dodds said it was a ""cautious but welcome step"" that would provide a measure of protection to smaller independent businesses, while at the same time easing footfall within larger retail outlets. All eyes will be on the Stormont Assembly on Monday 1 March. First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill will lay out the executive's pathway-to-recovery blueprint. It is not expected to include indicative dates, with Mrs Foster saying it would be ""data-led"". The executive's priority is to maintain Northern Ireland's reproduction rate of the virus - or R-number - below one. They have said careful, slow steps will be required to ensure Northern Ireland can exit lockdown sustainably. Ministers will also have to consider the long-term effects of keeping restrictions in place on the economy and people's well-being. However, compared to last year's first lockdown - there is a major difference now - as Northern Ireland has a well-established vaccination programme. The key message from Stormont remains that the fight to suppress coronavirus must continue, with hope for a way out ramping up later in the spring.

Three in 10 care home staff not vaccinated,"By Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter Three in 10 care home staff have not been vaccinated against Covid-19 despite being in the top four priority groups, according to data from NHS England. More than 435,000 workers in care homes for older adults are eligible in England, but only 304,600 have received a first dose. In London, only 52% of staff have had a jab, rising to 75% in the South West. The UK target of vaccinating 15 million people was met at the weekend. But these figures, up to 14 February, suggest there are large groups of care workers, who are in the top four priority groups, who have still not come forward. Some care home staff have previously said they refused the vaccine because of ""cultural issues"", but organisations representing care providers say they must be convinced to have one - to protect them and the services they work in. Some 95% of care home residents in England - who are also prioritised - have been vaccinated, with all regions above 93%.  Four groups - care home workers and residents, frontline health workers, the over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable people - have been prioritised for vaccines since the UK's mass vaccination programme started in December. This data shows that 1.02 million health workers in England have been vaccinated with a first dose.  This figure, which does not include agency staff, is equivalent to 88% of patient-facing staff. And 1.8 million of those at very high risk of serious illness from Covid-19 (deemed clinically extremely vulnerable) have also been given a vaccine. People in this group have specific health conditions or are undergoing certain types of treatment which increases their risk from coronavirus. A total of 2.2 million people in England are currently in this group which has been asked to shield, although an extra 1.7 million are expected to be added to the list based on other factors. A campaign to persuade people belonging to ethnic minorities to have a Covid vaccine is being shown across the UK on TV channels on Thursday. Official figures suggest they are less likely to be vaccinated. The latest evidence comes from a study of GP records looking at vaccine take-up. How many people have been vaccinated so far?

What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs?,"Covid infection rates in school hubs equate to 0.025%, according to figures released by Public Health Wales (PHW). From Monday, some of Wales' youngest children will return to classrooms for the first time since before Christmas. Public Health Wales (PHW) figures show in the last three weeks 290 pupils and staff at hubs have tested positive for Covid-19. However they added they were unable to determine whether or not these were transmitted through schools. Scientific advisers have said schools are safe but parents must not mix when dropping off and picking up pupils. Only about 10% of pupils - the children of key and critical workers and those classed as vulnerable - are attending school hubs currently. According to the report, between 1 September and 17 February, 8,906 cases were reported in schools, with 4,816 pupils and 4,090 staff testing positive. This equates to 77.7% of schools having a positive Covid case in that time, with 219 of Wales' 1,573 schools having had only one case. However recent figures show there were only 44 new cases in staff in last week, 51 in pupils. The previous week it was 46 in staff and 60 in pupils. Hubs usually see around 39,000 pupils in school a day  - so that is about 10 cases a day in pupils - which equates to 0.025% of those attending. However, PHW said there were big caveats because these infections were not necessarily acquired in schools. Looking at the picture in the last 20 days, only one single school had either eight cases or seven cases or six cases; 32 had two cases.  Health officials believe Covid does not seem to disproportionately impact on children and that schools going back is a ""sensible small step"". But they want parents to realise it does not mean a return to normal. It is not a signal for children to mix outside schools, for pupils to share lifts between school and home or for play-dates. Data shows as community transmission goes up, so does school transmission and there will be a close watch to see if there are local issues.  NAHT Cymru director Laura Doel said: ""We want nothing more than a safe and sustainable wider return to school, but there is still a lot of anxiety amongst school leaders around the implications of welcoming back more learners. ""The revised operational guidance for schools on crucial areas of mitigation measures such as bubbles, face covering, capacity to support distance learning, key worker and vulnerable children on site alongside foundation phase are proving to be huge operational challenges. ""Schools are doing all they can to reassure staff and parents of the measures they are taking to support the wider reopening, but we need to look at the impact of foundation phase return before thinking of extending the onsite provision further."" The latest data comes as some councils choose to delay opening full-time for children under seven. Ceredigion is operating a phased return where children will attend for one day in the first week with a full return expected from 3 March. Wrexham, Anglesey, Denbighshire and Gwynedd are also delaying the immediate return of younger pupils. Ceredigion is using a delayed return to ensure routines such as hand washing can be re-established, it is understood. It is also hoped it can help young children ""be reassured and eased back into the classroom in small groups where they can be given significant attention"", especially with staff now wearing masks. Meanwhile, Flintshire council has confirmed that all of its primary schools will reopen as planned from Monday, 22 February and start to phase in foundation phase pupils until all have returned by Friday 26th. Wales' case rates for Covid in the past seven days have dropped from 86 cases per 100,000 people on Wednesday to 83.7 on Thursday, with 17 out of Wales' 22 local authorities now under 100. Flintshire has replaced Wrexham as the county with the highest case rate in Wales at 126.8, although it has dropped from 122.4 on Wednesday. This is followed by Wrexham (117.7), Anglesey (112.8) and Powys (111.8). The lowest case rates are seen in Ceredigion (26.1), Pembrokeshire (48.5) and Bridgend (49). The Welsh Government has published safety guidance for schools ahead of the return. Some of the guidelines include social distancing for older pupils and class sizes ""as small a group as possible"".  The Welsh Government says face masks should be worn by staff if social distancing cannot be maintained - it has acknowledged young children ""will not be able to maintain social distancing"". It says both staff and secondary school learners should wear face masks anywhere on the school estate, including in the classroom It recognises younger children ""will not be able to maintain social distancing"", adding it is ""acceptable for them not to distance within their group"".  Staff need to maintain social distance from other staff and also from learners ""as much as possible, recognising this may not be possible with younger learners"". Where children undertake desk-based learning, classrooms should have forward-facing desks, one metre apart, but that ""this may not be possible or appropriate in all schools and settings and particularly for younger learners"". Schools have been told to ensure enhanced cleaning takes place, including cleaning frequently-touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents and disinfectants.

Airbnb lockdown party leads to fines for 19 people,"Nineteen people face fines of Â£800 each after attending a house party in breach of coronavirus lockdown rules. Police officers were called to an Airbnb in Portsmouth after being told of a large gathering.   Hampshire Constabulary released body-worn camera footage which appeared to show revellers attempting to push past officers at the door of the property. Assistant Chief Constable Maggie Blyth said the force was receiving more reports of gatherings in homes.   ""This party is not a one-off,"" she said.  ""We're increasingly seeing reports of gatherings of people from multiple households as some members of the public are struggling to observe the national restrictions in place. ""It's actions like this that place increased and unnecessary pressure on the NHS. The message is simple, stay at home."" The force said the party, which was held overnight on 30 January, was attended by teenagers and people aged in their 20s.  The police footage shows people attempting to leave the property while an officer says: ""Everyone's going to be leaving one at a time so we can process you guys and get your details."" A 27-year-old man, from Portsmouth, was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker and has been bailed until 5 March. A spokesman for the force said 19 people were reported for summons for Â£800 fixed penalty notices for breaches of Covid-19 regulations.

How many people have been vaccinated so far?,"By Lucy Rodgers and Dominic BaileyBBC Visual Journalism team  More than 16 million people in the UK have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine - part of the biggest inoculation programme the country has ever launched. In a race against a faster-spreading variant of the virus, ministers have pinned their hopes of ending a third national lockdown on protecting the most vulnerable groups by spring.  But there are huge challenges, not least the unprecedented scale and supply demands, but also the need for rigorous safety checks and deep-freeze storage. The government had aimed to offer vaccines to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, care home residents, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by mid-February and millions more people aged 50 and over and other priority groups by spring.  These groups account for 88% of deaths so far. The UK has now delivered almost 16.5 million vaccinations and the government says it has met its pledge of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups. A small number of the people receiving a jab will have been outside these priority groups. The number of first doses administered each day has been steadily climbing since December - with an average of more than 416,000 a day over the past week. The campaign to reach as many people as quickly as possible was boosted by a shift in policy in early January - to prioritise the first dose of a vaccine, with a second dose up to 12 weeks later, a bigger gap than originally planned.

More than 573,724 of those have received a second dose.  This progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally. How many people have been vaccinated so far? The speedy rollout of the vaccine to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS.  The vaccine rollout is now being expanded to include over-65s and those deemed clinically vulnerable. The rest of the over-50s will follow. From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population, another 21 million people. Teachers, transport workers, supermarket workers and the military could be prioritised. Within the UK, there has been some regional variation in the vaccination rollout - in particular between the nations. All English regions except London have now jabbed more than 90% of people aged 70 or above with their first dose, a total of 7.1 million people according to weekly data released on Thursday. A further 452,008 people in the same age range have received their first dose in Wales (90%) and 676,325 people in Scotland (91%) - as of 18 February. No equivalent figure for Northern Ireland was available, but the Northern Ireland Health Department said 409,507 first doses had been given in total, including 94% of people aged 80 or older (67,824). There are also disparities between ethnic groups and poorer and wealthier areas. Analysis of NHS records by the OpenSAFELY group - a collaboration between Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine - shows that black people were the least likely to have received a vaccine among those aged 80 and over, while white people were the most likely. The study was based on more than 20 million patient records in England and covers people not living in care homes. Areas of London are under-represented in the data.    In addition, 85% of those aged 80 and over in the poorest areas had been given the vaccine by 11 February compared with 94% in the most affluent areas. The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator.  The Pfizer-BioNTech jab - the first to be given the green light in December - is being imported from Puurs, Belgium.  A second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, is being made in Britain by two biotech companies: Oxford BioMedica, based in Oxford; and Cobra Biologics, based at Keele Science Park, Staffs.  Another company, Wockhardt, based in Wrexham, fills the vials and packages them for use. Supplies of a third vaccine to be approved, made by US company Moderna, will come from Switzerland or Spain but are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. A jab manufactured by US firm Novavax will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England, while another by French company Valneva will be made in Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. The third, by Belgian firm Janssen, owned by Johnson & Johnson, should also be available later this year. People will be vaccinated in three main ways, at:  The government has urged the public to ""play their part"" in supporting ""the largest vaccination programme in British history"", including helping people attend their appointments. In England, more than 1,500 sites, including GPs' surgeries, community pharmacies and hospital hubs, are offering vaccination services.  They also include 90 major vaccine sites which have been set up in larger premises, such as sports centres, racecourses and showgrounds, which are capable of giving jabs to thousands of people a week. In Wales, the vaccine is being distributed at GP practices and by mobile units. And they hope to have 35 mass vaccination centres up and running in the coming weeks. In Scotland, as well as GPs surgeries, pharmacies and hospital hubs, there will also be a number of larger vaccination sites, including 16 in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. The UK has ordered 407 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines - three of which have so far been approved for use.  Among them are 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine - enough to inoculate 50 million people. This, when combined with the 40 million ordered Pfizer jabs, will cover the entire population, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. The UK also has significant orders of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved in January. But having vaccines on order is not the same as having them ready to go.  There have been a number of challenges in what is called the vaccine ""supply chain"" - the logistics of how the jab gets from manufacturers to people. Getting enough supplies in the first place, checking those supplies are up to scratch and transporting vaccines according to their requirements have all thrown up difficulties.

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer wants millions of savers to be given a chance to invest in the UK's recovery from the coronavirus crisis. His British Recovery Bond scheme is the centrepiece of his alternative plan for ""national recovery"", ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget on 3 March. The Conservatives said Sir Keir had stolen most of his ideas from them.  The Stormont executive has agreed  lockdown restrictions in Northern Ireland will remain in place until 1 April, but children aged four to seven will go back to school on Monday 8 March, BBC News NI understands. Another review of the measures will take place on 18 March. Health officials said they wanted to avoid a possible rise in cases around St Patrick's Day and in the run-up to Easter. It may be legal for companies to insist on new staff being vaccinated as a condition of their employment, the justice secretary has said. However, Robert Buckland added it was unlikely bosses would be able to make existing workers have vaccines under their current contracts. Downing Street said it would be ""discriminatory"" to order people to be vaccinated to keep their job. The number of people applying to study nursing at UK universities has risen by almost a third (32%). There were 60,130 applicants for nursing by the main 29 January application deadline, according to the figures from the university admissions service. ""Inspiring stories"" from wards over the past year have led to the surge, says Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant. In his 30s with no underlying health conditions, Liam Thorp was surprised to be told he qualified for a Covid vaccine. As suspected, a mistake had been made - the NHS had listed him as 6.2cm tall, giving him a worrying body mass index of 28,000. ""I've put on a few pounds in lockdown but I was surprised to have made it to clinically, morbidly-obese,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

Starmer targets savers in 'national recovery plan',"Millions of savers would be given a chance to invest in the UK's recovery from the coronavirus crisis, under proposals set out by Sir Keir Starmer. The Labour leader's British Recovery Bond scheme is the centrepiece of his alternative plan for ""national recovery"", ahead of 3 March's Budget. He also proposed start-up loans for 100,000 new small firms, especially in areas outside the South-East. The Conservatives said Sir Keir had stolen most of his ideas from them. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's plans to haul the UK economy out of the deepest recession in 300 years in his Budget speech next month. But Sir Keir said the Conservatives were ""incapable of seizing this moment"", adding: ""All we can expect from this government is more of the same. Labour would choose a different path."" The government said it has spent Â£280bn to help the economy through the pandemic, including tax breaks, grants and wage support for workers.  But Sir Keir told the BBC people would have to ""judge the government on its record"", with 10 years of ""weakening of our foundations, the pulling money out of our public services, the underfunding of the NHS and the failure to fix care homes"". In an interview with the BBC's deputy political editor, Vicki Young, the Labour leader said: ""You can't clap your keyworkers during a pandemic, then go back to business as usual and that is where this government will head. ""The first step has to be a recovery and a thriving economy, and if you put taxes up or you go for austerity, you will throttle that [before] you have even got to first base."" ""We have been through too much here and there is a parallel with [World War Two], where people have been through sacrifice and solidarity and they want a better future, and that is what I am setting out the path to."" Conservative Party co-chair Amanda Milling, accused Labour of stealing her party's policies, adding: ""After 10 months of Keir Starmer, all Labour has to offer is others' ideas, empty rhetoric and calling for things the government is already doing."" The main policy the Labour leader put forward was a British Recovery Bond. A Labour government would offer people a savings account with the government at a competitive interest rate - similar to the previous National Savings and Investments bonds. The cash raised would then be spent on rebuilding the country post-Covid.  It comes off the back of figures from the Bank of England, which showed households had accumulated over Â£125bn in excess savings by November 2020 - estimated to hit Â£250bn by June 2021 - but with only around 5% of the savings expected to be spent, with much of the rest sitting in savings accounts.  Sir Keir said this money could be used to ""invest in local communities, jobs and businesses"", as well as providing security for savers and giving ""millions of people a proper stake in Britain's future"". The Conservatives said the policy was the same as one proposed by the Northern Research Group of Tory MPs, although that group's ""Northern Recovery Bond"" plan is not government policy.  But speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir said the chancellor was instead ""pinning a lot of hope on the idea that those who have saved during the pandemic... are going to spend all that money in the short term"". He added: ""I don't think that is realistic and I don't think the Bank of England does. What the bond does is provide a way for people to invest in the future of their country in a secure way, and obviously then releases money for infrastructure projects."" The pandemic has blurred political lines over the last year. The Conservatives have been forced to become big-spending big government. Meanwhile, Labour has been stuck between being criticised for being too supportive and, when it has been critical, being accused of carping from the sidelines. The point of this speech was to take voters out of the extraordinary circumstances of the pandemic and remind them of the party politics of before. Although, of course, not exactly those politics, as this was also an opportunity for Sir Keir to address some of the pressure to start setting out his vision for Labour. So, there was a promise of continuing with significant government intervention in the economy but also of financial responsibility and of making business ""pivotal"". The big policy reveal of the speech -  British Recovery Bonds - neatly sums ups the aims Sir Keir set out of long-term investment, partnership and giving people a stake in society. But it relies on those who have been left better off from the pandemic, rather than the many who have not.  Saving bonds are also known for being pretty low risk. The choice of this as a policy to unveil is unlikely to pacify those who would like to see Labour being more radical. Sir Keir also proposed to provide an extra Â£1bn of funding for the Start Up Loans Company, which provides finance for people wanting to launch their own businesses. The Labour leader said the scheme had offered less than 9,500 loans per year since it started in 2012, with nearly Â£1 in Â£4 going into London - compared to just 5.7% going to the North East. Sir Keir said targeting existing funding and tweaking the scheme would help to create 100,000 small businesses across the country. The Labour leader also reiterated his party's calls for the government to: A Budget had been expected to take place in autumn last year, but it was delayed until next month because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Covid restrictions have prompted the government to spend billions in unprecedented interventions aimed at keeping the economy afloat during the crisis. This has pushed up UK debt to Â£2.13 trillion, equivalent to 99.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) - a level not seen since the early 1960s.  The chancellor is under pressure from MPs and industry groups to extend support measures, but also to spell out when and how the UK's debts can be paid down.

Vaccine uptake gap for BAME community,"The uptake gap in Covid vaccines between people in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities and white individuals has been revealed. Uptake in black, Asian, mixed and other groups was 71.5% between 8 December and 14 February, compared to 85.6% in the white ethnic group. A Public Health Wales (PHW) inquiry also found a gap between those living in the most and least deprived areas. It said the trends of ""emerging inequalities"" mirror those in the UK. PHW looked at data from the Welsh Immunisation System to assess inequalities in coverage of Covid-19 vaccination by sex, socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic group. Its publication comes after calls for such data to be made public in what Race Council Cymru chairman Ray Singh described as ""a race against time"". In addition to the 14 percentage point difference in uptake between different ethnic communities, the uptake gap between the most and least deprived areas is between 4.4% and 5.7%, depending on the age group. ""As Wales continues its journey to roll out the national Covid-19 vaccination programme, we can see from this report that vaccination uptake is currently lower in groups who are at increased risk of severe Covid-19 outcomes,"" said Dr Richard Roberts, PHW's head of the vaccine preventable diseases programme. ""The safety of Covid-19 vaccines is being confirmed by the experience of millions of people vaccinated in the UK so far, and it is important for all communities in Wales to be fully informed about the benefits of vaccination."" Dr Roberts said he wanted to make sure eligible people with concerns are aware they can still get the vaccine now or at a later date. Ray Singh, chairman of Race Council Cymru, said: ""This is what I suspected. It does not make good reading. Potentially, it is really serious. ""There are a number of reasons why the people in BAME groups are reluctant to take the vaccine. ""Social media has not helped. Also, older generations are still attached to their homeland and the myth that it has got human tissue and alcohol, especially Muslim communities from Bangladesh and Pakistan. ""We have tried to allay these fears, especially with older people who think 'we have lived a full life, we don't have to worry'. ""The tragedy of it is that if they could be spoken to so they understand this, they clearly love their families and by not having this they are not helping them at all. ""If they contract this virus, they can pass it on to other people, especially people living in overcrowded accommodation."" PHW will continue to monitor and report on uptake rates with the aim of reducing inequalities, added Dr Simon Cottrell, senior principal epidemiologist at PHW.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56114189,1
Mum's 'torment' at not seeing daughter with cancer,"A mother whose daughter has incurable cancer and was given just days to live at Christmas has said it is ""sheer torment"" not being able to meet up. Marion Thomas, from Cleethorpes, last saw her daughter Michelle Teale, in December, when they were told the cancer had spread. Despite her prognosis, Mrs Teale, 58, from Leicester, has not been able to see her mother again due to lockdown. Mrs Thomas, 85, said: ""I hope it goes off shortly and I can get to see her"". The mother and daughter, who live about 90 miles (145km) apart, were separated for 22 weeks last year as a result of the extended lockdown in Leicester. They were reunited in August but then came the news in December that Mrs Teale's secondary breast cancer had spread to her liver and lungs. ""I was rushed into hospital and sent home on 20 December and they gave me around three days to live,"" she said. ""It was so bad, I planned my own funeral."" But Mrs Teale, who was first diagnosed in April 2019, has defied doctors' expectations and said although she was never going to get any better, she was ""heading in the right direction"". She said without the support of her husband, Melvyn, and her mother she would not have been able to keep so positive.  ""It's always been Melvyn and my mum - the three musketeers - and without each other we would have faded by the wayside,"" she said. ""Every day is a challenge and if I get through each day, that's another day ticked off my list."" Mrs Thomas, a breast cancer survivor herself, said the main thing was ""Michelle was still here.""

"Waiting list hits record 538,861 amid pandemic","Numbers in Wales who are waiting for non-urgent hospital treatment have hit a record high of 538,861. More than 82,000 people have been added to the list since last March, latest NHS Wales figures show.  It comes after the number of those waiting more than nine months grew by eight times to 226,138 people, from 27,314 in January 2020. In-roads have been made on the longest waits, with nearly 5,000 fewer on the list in December than the month before. Waiting lists grew after most non-urgent treatment was postponed in March to prepare the NHS for Covid patients. But the NHS has been trying to continue with surgery in recent months, although continuing pressure has forced some postponements. Chris Jones, deputy chief medical officer for Wales, said it would be a ""mammoth task"" to clear the backlog.  He said: ""The backlog for some categories of patients has increased because it's still difficult, even though the number of people in our hospital with Covid has decreased.   ""We still [have] around 2,000 people with Covid-related problems in Welsh hospitals and of course those people would not have been there a year ago, so that is a big challenge but we do need to start getting other care, other services, online as quickly as possible. ""We don't have backlogs for cancer care [but] there are other huge backlogs for surgery, orthopaedic surgery, other types of surgery, endoscopy proceduresâ¦ and these have to be cleared but it will be a mammoth task and it will take a considerable period of time."" The Welsh NHS Confederation said in a statement the figures showed the ""scale"" of the task facing the health service.  It added: ""We know this is hard for people... but there is some hope on the horizon and the NHS will do all it can to deal with that backlog once we come through the pandemic."" We can now see all the figures for 2020 and they show: But the likes of hip and knee operations are where the numbers waiting the longest are the greatest. There are more than 80,340 people waiting for treatment to start. Nearly two thirds face a wait above 36 weeks. The overall list meanwhile has risen by nearly a quarter since January. Welsh Government targets state 95% of patients should be treated within six months and nobody should wait longer than six months. Experimental  performance measures, January 2021 44,500patients seen across  A&E units 16minutes average wait, time to triage  64minutes average wait, time to see clinician 43.7%no follow-up required  27.15%patient admitted to hospital Along with waiting times figures, the Welsh Government is now publishing three new ""experimental"" performance measures for A&E departments, for January: No targets have been set in relation to these measures and the Welsh Government said they were set with input from front-line emergency care staff. The current target is 95% of patients should spend no longer than four hours in A&E, but this has never been met since it was introduced in 2010. The waiting times for A&E in January showed 74.2% of patients were seen, transferred or discharged within four hours, a 4.2% improvement on December. The worst performance was only 42% seen within four hours at Glan Clwyd hospital. There were 5,462 patients across Wales who waited more than 12 hours, even though the targets state nobody should have to wait that long. This is 924 fewer patients than the month before. Other figures show: Teaching assistant Lorraine Ledwell has been waiting for a hip operation for almost two years. She tries to cope but her arthritis causes her constant pain.  The 53-year-old does not sleep well because she gets up every few hours to take painkillers.  She says she cannot do much on weekends as she spends the time catching up on sleep. ""I don't want to be that person that takes tablets every (few) hours, that can't sleep because of pain,"" she said. ""I don't want to be that person. I want to be the person that I was, that could sit on the floor with my children at work.  ""I can't do that anymore.  ""I'm still a good auntie and great auntie, but I want to be that one who can sit on the floor and really play with the little ones.""  She says she misses being active.  ""I want to be that person again without hurting."" Her condition causes her to suffer a constant dull ache.  When she walks pain ""radiates"" down her leg. ""At the moment there are times when I don't cope, and I know I'm not the only person that is like that,"" she said. So far Lorraine, from Bridgend, has been on the waiting list for 97 weeks. ""When I went for the initial referral they said it would be about a year,"" she said. ""I knew the waiting list was going to be that time, it's just a given.""  Having once worked for the NHS she knew it was busy.  Now she just wants to get back to ""normality."" She said: ""Physically I can cope to a certain point, there are certain strategies, certain things I can do to help with the physical pain day to day. ""I find it is tougher mentally because I am waiting for a call. Every time I hear a phone ring or see a number I don't recognise I think, 'That is them calling.' ""That is the point where they are going to say 'Right, your journey is starting.'  ""I want to start my journey.  ""I thought I had started it two years ago and nothing happened, it completely stalled. ""It seems funny to say that I want to go through that pain, that I want to go through having parts of my bone removed. ""But I want to go through that because I know that, at the end of that journey I am going to be a happier person, because I'm not in pain.""

Covid loss sees zoo halt 'vital' conservation work,"A zoo's ""vital"" conservation work in Africa and Asia has been halted because of Covid-19's impact on its finances. Chester Zoo said since March 2020, coronavirus restrictions had led to a Â£10m loss, which meant many projects had been ""put on hold"". A spokesman said projects supporting Nigeria's chimpanzees, Javan warty pigs and Uganda's rhinos had been affected. The government said support was available through the Zoo Animals Fund and other schemes. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spokesman added that the Â£100m emergency fund was there ""to ensure that those facing severe financial difficulties can continue to provide the best possible care for their animals"".  The Cheshire zoo's chief operating officer Jamie Christon said larger sites had been unable to access the financial support and only 10% of the promised relief had so far been distributed.  The zoo, which runs 80 conservation projects in 30 countries, is one of the largest in the country and is home to more than 35,000 animals from more than 500 of the world's rarest species. It costs more than Â£1.6m a month to run and usually receives 97% of its income from visitors. During the lockdowns, a fundraising appeal has seen it raise about Â£3m, after more than 130,000 donors from 90 countries sent money. The spokesman said the ""huge losses"" it had incurred had also seen it halt projects supporting other endangered species on the two continents, including schemes helping hornbills in Malaysia, songbirds in Indonesia, Uganda's giraffes and the east Javan banteng, though he added that ""happily"", some ""vital work"" was ongoing. Mr Christon said he hoped that the zoo would be able to reopen before Easter so it could raise much-needed revenue. ""We're saying to the government 'we're a safe, secure site'; we've already proven that last summer,"" he said.  A Defra spokesman said it had ""expanded the eligibility criteria from the previous Zoo Support Fund, increasing the amount of reserves that applicants must have from six weeks to 12 weeks"".

'Strong decline' in virus in England since January,"There has been a ""strong decline"" in levels of coronavirus infections in England since January, say scientists tracking the epidemic. Imperial College London's React study found infections have dropped by two-thirds across England since lockdown began, with an 80% fall in London. But virus levels are still high, with one in 200 testing positive between 4 and 13 February.  This is similar to levels seen in late September 2020. Although these are interim findings, based on more than 85,000 swab tests from randomly selected people, they suggest social distancing and restrictions are having an impact. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the programme at Imperial, said the drop in infection rates was ""really encouraging"".  It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepares to receive new data on the effect of vaccines on the spread of coronavirus, ahead of Monday's publication of a roadmap for easing the lockdown in England. Speaking on Wednesday he said it was ""absolutely right"" to take a ""data not dates"" approach to leaving lockdown, and stressed England would ease measures ""cautiously"". In Northern Ireland, ministers have agreed to extend lockdown restrictions to 1 April, although children in primary 1 to primary 3 (aged four to seven) will go back to school on 8 March. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will make an announcement next week on whether some pupils will return to school. The Welsh government is due to given an indication of its plans for coming out of lockdown on Friday. A further 12,057 Covid cases have been reported in the UK, and there have been another 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Thursday, 13,494 cases and 678 deaths were reported. The total number of people to have received the first dose of vaccine now stands at 16,423,082 - a daily rise of 482,110. According to the Imperial College London team, during early-to-mid-February 0.51% of people in the study tested positive in England, down from 1.57% in early January. In London, positive tests fell from 2.83% to 0.54% over six weeks. The study's author Prof Steven Riley described the fall in cases in London as ""dramatic"" and said there had been ""a strong downward trend since January - better than many hoped for"", which is equivalent to a halving of infections every 15 days. The researchers estimated the R number - the average number of people one infected person will pass the virus on to - was around 0.72. But more than 20,000 Covid patients are currently in hospital in the UK, and although new daily cases and hospital admissions are falling, they are still relatively high. NHS England figures show 80% of critical care beds were occupied in the week to 14 February, a slight fall from 83% the week before. There are just under 4,800 patients in critical care, with 6,000 beds available. Prof Elliott told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Nobody wants to be in lockdown any longer than they have to be but a note of warning - the prevalence rates are still very high. They are as high as they were in September when they were on the increase and the numbers of people in hospital currently are at a level that they were in the first wave so we really have to be cautious."" While the virus is declining in all nine English regions, and substantially in the capital, South East and West Midlands, it is falling less steeply in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and the Humber. This could be linked to tougher lockdown rules being introduced earlier in London and south-east England after a pre-Christmas surge in cases related to the more transmissible virus variant first discovered in Kent. The latest Public Health England surveillance data also shows case rates have fallen in every region. The East Midlands has the highest rate, 177 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 14 February, but this is down from 228 the previous week. The React report found falls in infections across all age groups, with 18 to 24-year-olds and five to 12-year-olds currently having the highest virus levels - although still below 1%. It estimates the over-65s have the lowest levels of virus at 0.3%. More young children have been attending school during this lockdown than in the last one, which may have helped keep virus levels slightly higher in these age groups. But the researchers stressed opening schools to all children was a high priority and there would have to be a ""trade-off"". Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said in a tweet that the results of the React study made ""the strongest case for a phased reopening of schools"".  A ""big bang"" reopening with the current high rates of infection and hospitalisation would ""jeopardise full and sustained school reopening"", she added. The study identified groups that were more likely to test positive - including people of Asian ethnicity, those working in healthcare or care homes, people living in the most deprived areas and those in larger households. Prof Elliott said the study had not seen an impact from the vaccination programme on infections yet, with all age groups seeing a drop in rates, but said the team would keep a ""close eye"" when it had an effect on transmission. The researchers say signs may be visible by the time the final report is released in a matter of weeks, when a larger proportion of people will have been given protection. The report is yet to be peer-reviewed or published.

US life expectancy falls by a year amid pandemic,"Life expectancy in the US fell by a full year in the first half of 2020, a change experts say was fuelled by the growing coronavirus pandemic. The life expectancy for the entire population dropped to 77.8 years, according to a report by the Centers for Disease Control. ""This is a huge decline,"" Dr Robert Anderson, the CDC's Chief of Mortality Statistics, told the Associated Press. But there were even greater changes among ethnic minority groups. Black men suffered the largest decline, with life expectancy dropping by three years between January and June 2020. And Hispanic men saw a fall in life expectancy of 2.4 years during that period. The fall among Hispanic women was lower, at 1.1 years. ""You have to go back to World War Two, the 1940s, to find a decline like this,"" Dr Anderson said.  Experts say that ethnic minority communities have borne the brunt of the pandemic, as they are more likely to work in frontline low-wage jobs and endure crowded living conditions. The decline means life expectancy at birth is now 75.1 years for American men - a decline of 1.2 years from 2019. For women, life expectancy is 80.5 years after it fell by almost a year. Deaths from coronavirus were a key factor driving the overall drop in life expectancy, according to the CDC report. They made up about two-thirds of excess US deaths in 2020. More than 490,000 people have died as a result of Covid-19 in the US, the highest death toll in the world. But analysts say the latest CDC figures reflected only the first wave of Covid deaths, including deaths from other causes which the pandemic has affected. The figures for the next six months are expected to be worse. Statistics have also shown how the pandemic is disproportionately affecting black and other minority communities in the US. Black Americans are three times more likely to die from the virus than white Americans, and the life expectancy of males has fallen by three years and females by 2.3 years. Analysis by the Brookings Institution published last year said: ""In every age category, black people are dying from Covid at roughly the same rate as white people more than a decade older."" Meanwhile the smallest decreases were among white men and women - of 0.8 years and 0.7 years respectively. The latest CDC data is based on death certificates processed during the first half of 2020. Given the six-month timeframe, the report notes that the estimates ""do not reflect the entirety of the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020"". It also makes clear that the virus affected different areas of the country at different times, with urban communities more likely to have been hit hard during the early months of the year. ""Life expectancy at birth... may be underestimated since the populations more severely affected, Hispanic and non-Hispanic black populations, are more likely to live in urban areas,"" the report says. But the virus was not the only factor behind the change. The CDC also notes ""increases in provisional drug overdose deaths through early 2020"". The current life expectancy remains lower than the peak US life expectancy of 78.9 years, from 2014, and is shorter than the average of 80 years in the OECD, an organisation of mostly-rich countries.

Covid variant surge testing to start in Leeds,"Surge testing is to be carried out in parts of Leeds after two possible cases of the South African variant of Covid-19 were detected in the city. People living in parts of the LS8 postcode area will be asked to take a test whether they have symptoms or not. Leeds City Council said there was ""no indication of live cases"" in the area, but that testing would help the city ""prepare for new variants"". The week-long programme of testing is due to start on Monday. Victoria Eaton, director of public health for Leeds, said: ""We want to reassure local residents that the extra testing being announced for people without symptoms is to help us better understand and prepare for new variants in our communities.   ""There is absolutely no indication of live cases of the South African variant in the LS8 area, and no evidence of a greater risk of transmission for local people.   ""This additional testing will allow us to find any potential asymptomatic cases of new variants and build a more detailed, comprehensive picture of where those cases may come from and how they might spread."" The additional testing will be taking place in parts of the Harehills and the area north of Easterly Road, where the suspected cases were found in January. Leeds City Council said both the individuals in the cases identified last month had made a full recovery and there was no evidence of transmission to the wider community. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said: ""People living within this targeted area are strongly encouraged to take a Covid-19 test when offered, whether they are showing symptoms or not.""

"Testing means 'staggered' school return, say heads","By Sean CoughlanFamily and education correspondent The return of secondary school pupils in England may need to be ""staggered"" to allow students to be tested for Covid, head teachers' leaders say. It will not be possible to carry out tests on every pupil if they arrive to start together on 8 March, says Geoff Barton, of the ASCL heads' union. ""It would make more sense for them to be brought back into school in phases and tested as they return,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is to set out plans for the return on Monday. The heads' leader says ""no final decision"" has yet been made about the reopening of schools, while England's Department for Education has said schools will open on 8 March ""at the earliest"". Ahead of Monday's announcement, Mr Barton says the practicalities of preventing pupils from mixing before they have all been tested meant accepting secondary schools would need to stagger the return. ""If they come back into the classroom all at the same time they would have to be taken out of class for the tests to take place, by which time they will have already mixed,"" he said. When pupils returned in the autumn term, some schools brought back year groups on different days. There has been a long-standing intention for all schools and all ages of pupils to return on 8 March. Plans for going back are still under discussion and there have been suggestions that, after an initial round of Covid testing in schools, further tests would be carried out each week at home by parents. Mr Barton says head teachers have ""urged the government to allow these Covid tests to be done at home using home-testing kits"" to lessen the pressure on schools. There are also suggestions that in secondary schools, where social distancing is not possible, pupils might have to wear face masks. The head teachers' leader says new guidance on safety measures in schools is expected next week, which will include face coverings. The decisions on England's return to school will be announced on Monday, when the prime minister will set out his ""road map"" for reopening after lockdown. This is expected to be accompanied by a series of announcements on schools in the following days - with funding for catch-up classes, details of how testing will work and how cancelled GCSEs and A-levels will be replaced this summer. There could also be a campaign to build parental confidence in the safety of the return to school, with many pupils having been at home and studying online since the start of the Christmas holidays. England's schools have been closed to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers since the Christmas break. Figures showed that last week, before half term, almost a quarter of primary school pupils were in class. A lower proportion, about one in 20 pupils, were going into secondary schools. A spokesman for England's Department for Education said: ""We know schools, parents and pupils need clarity on plans as soon as possible, which is why we have committed to providing two weeks' notice for them to prepare. ""The prime minister is due to set out plans for schools reopening on 22 February, and pupils will return from 8 March at the earliest.""

"Pupil catch-up money lower in Wales, report finds","By Bethan LewisBBC Wales education and family correspondent Cash to help Wales' pupils catch up is ""notably lower"" than in some other UK nations, according to new analysis. The Education Policy Institute found Â£88 per pupil in Wales had so far been allocated - less than half the Â£200 per pupil announced for Scottish pupils. But it also found that a bigger share of Wales' funding was targeted at poorer pupils. The Welsh Government said its priority was to enable pupils to return to face-to-face education. The report also found Wales' autumn term attendance was the lowest in the UK, dropping to 68% by mid-December. In July, a Â£29m fund to pay for the equivalent of 900 extra teaching staff and targeted at disadvantaged pupils and those in exam years was announced by the Welsh Government. Along with additional funding for post-16 pupils, the report calculated that about Â£40m had been allocated to help Welsh pupils catch up after losing weeks of face-to-face teaching due to the pandemic. The equivalent figure for Scotland is Â£140m - or Â£200 per pupil - and in England it is Â£1.2bn - or Â£174 per pupil. The report said while catch-up funding was ""clearly lower"" in Wales, about half was targeted at more disadvantaged pupils - higher than in England and Scotland. However, it said all four nations should invest more in order to address the scale of the challenge. The think tank said the nations' current plans ""offer only a fraction of the support that is needed to deal with the huge amount of lost learning time"".  The report also found attendance levels in schools before Christmas mostly reflected rates of coronavirus, which resulted in many pupils having to learn remotely. School attendance was generally lowest in Wales - often under 85% - over the course of the autumn term, while in Scotland it was 90-95%.  Figures were lower in disadvantaged areas and for older pupils, dropping to about 50% for Welsh pupils in Year 10 and above by the second week of December. Plaid Cymru said lower attendance in deprived areas when schools were open and difficulties in accessing online learning meant poorer pupils were at ""a double disadvantage"". The party's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said more clarity was needed about how money for extra teaching staff had been spent. ""Focus must be on being able to provide as much face-to-face learning as possible, targeted at those children who have lost the most learning, and this can only be obtained through a massive recruitment drive,"" she said. The Welsh Conservatives said the report showed the Welsh Government was ""letting down school pupils"". The party's education spokeswoman, Suzy Davies, said the government had underspent by Â£12m at a time when charities were ""running around looking for unwanted IT kit for learners"" and some children were without internet. ""If the [Education Policy Institute's] figures are right then this is an actual, copper-bottomed scandal,"" she added. The Welsh Government said it recognised pupils' attendance rate would have been affected by local school decisions and ""factors surrounding community transmission"". ""As our children and young people return, we'll continue to work with local authorities and schools to ensure education continues with as little disruption as possible,"" it added.

Record numbers apply to study nursing,"Record numbers have applied to study nursing at UK universities during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of people applying for nursing courses has risen by almost a third (32%), according to statistics from the university admissions service. ""Inspiring stories"" from wards over the past year has led to the surge, says Ucas chief executive Clare Marchant. The government says it is ""another step closer"" to delivering 50,000 more nurses for the NHS.  There were 60,130 applicants for nursing by the main 29 January application deadline, the Ucas figures show. The number of UK school-leavers opting for nursing increased by 27% from last year to a record 16,560. And more than 10,000 people aged 35 or over have applied to study nursing for the first time this year - a rise of 39% on 2020. Florence Reeve, 25, says the coronavirus pandemic gave her the motivation to apply to study children's nursing at the University of Plymouth in September, after seeing the experience of friends working in hospitals.  ""I've always been interested in healthcare, but I've never really had that push or drive to go for it,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Funnily enough, the pandemic has made me want to work in hospitals, despite what my friends who currently work at Derriford Hospital have said. And despite the news, it's actually made me want to go into hospital even more, and help even more, so it doesn't scare me at all. In fact, I'm really excited to just jump straight in and just do as much as I can. ""I think before the pandemic, people viewed nursing as quite a simple job, that [there] wasn't much to it and it was quite easy and everyone could do it. But during the pandemic, it has really shown everyone in the world how much nurses are needed."" Meanwhile, the figures appear to show that the number of EU applicants to all subjects at UK universities has fallen by 40% to 26,010 in the past year. Ucas suggests uncertainty surrounding Brexit at the end of 2020 and changes to student support arrangements have contributed to the drop.  EU nationals not covered by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement will no longer be eligible for home fee status and loans for courses starting in September. However, figures show a record 85,610 people have applied to study in the UK from countries outside the EU - a rise of 17% compared to last year. Ucas also said the latest statistics showed that a growing number of 18-year-olds from the most disadvantaged areas in the UK have applied to university. The largest proportional increase in UK applicants by their declared ethnic group came from black and mixed race students - both up 15% to 40,690 and 25,830 respectively. Overall, a record 42.6% of all UK 18-year-olds had applied to university by the main deadline last month, up from 39.5% at the same point last year. Ms Marchant said: ""The amazing work of our NHS continues to inspire people of all ages into fulfilling and rewarding careers, helping those in most need as we emerge from the pandemic. Overall, applications are buoyant as students plan their futures for life after lockdown."" The Royal College of Nursing has previously warned there is a widespread nursing shortage across the NHS - which could lead to staff burnout. A report by the Health Foundation released in December said the impact of Covid has brought the ""urgent need"" to deal with the shortage into ""sharp focus"". Speaking about the Ucas figures, director for England at the Royal College of Nursing Mike Adams said: ""This is a welcome boost in applications but follows a number of years of decline since the removal of government support for tuition fees and living costs."" He warned that the increase in applications is ""still not at the scale that is needed"" and said greater efforts are needed to fill thousands of vacant nursing jobs. The government has committed to adding 50,000 more nurses to the NHS workforce by 2025.  Last year, it introduced bursaries of at least Â£5,000 per year for nursing, midwifery and allied health professional students. Care Minister Helen Whately said: ""These figures are a testament to the work of Health Education England and Ucas in highlighting nursing as a rewarding and accessible career path, as well as the remarkable achievements of all health and care professionals over the past year. ""We're another step closer to delivering 50,000 more nurses for our NHS and providing better healthcare for everyone.""  Have you applied to become a nurse? Share your reasons.

"'No jab, no job' policies may be legal for new staff","It may be legal for companies to insist on new staff being vaccinated as a condition of their employment, the justice secretary has said. However, Robert Buckland said it was unlikely bosses could make existing workers have vaccines under their current contracts. Downing Street has said it would be ""discriminatory"" to order people to be vaccinated to keep their job.  But some firms say they will not hire new staff who refuse to have the jab. In an interview with ITV on Wednesday, Mr Buckland said compelling new staff to be inoculated could, in theory, be possible if it was written into their contracts.  However, employers would probably need to take legal action if existing staff refused such an order, he said. ""I think that has to be the case because we're dealing with existing terms of contracts of employment, thousands of existing contracts,â he said. He added that the legality of âno jab, no jobâ would depend âvery much on the terms of employment and the particular contractâ. ""Generally speaking I'd be surprised if there were contracts of employment existing now that did make that approach lawful. I think frankly the issue would have to be tested.â London-based Pimlico Plumbers is one company that has said it will not hire new staff who have refused the vaccination on non-medical grounds. Employment lawyers initially questioned the move, but on Wednesday founder Charlie Mullins said he had been advised it was legal. ""We've obviously been talking to lawyers and they're very happy that we can add this proposal to any new workers that start with us once the vaccine is rolled out,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  ""We'll be using the new contracts two to three months from now. When people come along for a job with us, if they're not happy to sign that, then again that's their choice, but they certainly won't be given a job with Pimlico Plumbers."" Care home operator Barchester Healthcare has also said all new hires will be obliged to get the jab.  ""With regards to our staff, we are doing all we can to reassure and encourage those who are a little more reticent to have the vaccination, and we are also ensuring that all new staff must have the vaccination (if they medically can) before starting work looking after our vulnerable residents and patients who are in our care,"" Barchester Healthcare wrote on its website.  David Samuels, legal director at law firm Lewis Silkin, said that there is nothing legally to stop a business from placing a ""no jab, no job"" clause in contracts for new hires. However, he cautioned that employers would need to analyse each job role and evaluate health and safety risks before introducing such a clause.  Failure to do so would make it possible to challenge a contract as being unfair or discriminatory, if a claimant can prove they are exempt from having the vaccine for some reason, or unable to access it.  There are concerns, for example, that ""no jab, no job"" policies would disproportionately affect young people who are last in line to get the jab.   ""It's going to be harder to justify - especially if they don't go through that process and document it, and it will be more likely that they will be challenged successfully through a legal claim,"" Mr Samuels told the BBC.  He added that his firm had received enquiries about whether such a clause could be put in place if the business necessitated some staff to work in the office or in a factory.

Coronavirus cases in London,"There have been more than 3.56 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in England and more than 111,000 people have died, government figures show.  London is under an England-wide lockdown, which prevents any social mixing between households.  Londoners are asked only to leave home for limited reasons such as shopping, going to work, seeking medical assistance, or avoiding domestic abuse. People in Tottenham Hale, Pollards Hill, West Ealing and West Norwood have been singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variant of coronavirus. People in these areas should further limit the time they spend away from home, according to government advice. Public Health England data shows six London boroughs have infection rates higher than the England average.  Infection rates are reducing in all boroughs.  Below is a table of local authority areas in London showing how many people have tested positive for coronavirus in the week leading up to 13 February and whether the number is on the rise. The chart below shows the changing coronavirus infection rate across London since the start of March.  A technical glitch meant 15,841 cases between 25 September and 2 October were originally left out of the UK daily case figures. Over that same week the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in London jumped by 1,461 confirmed cases to more than 4,800. The week before, cases had increased by 1,488 confirmed cases. Deaths linked to coronavirus in London are decreasing, following a spike in January. For a more detailed look at coronavirus where you live, use the BBC's postcode checker:

Women 'better at following coronavirus rules',"Research suggests that women are better than men and young people at following coronavirus rules. The findings are based on a survey of 7,000 people by a team at the University of Aberdeen. They said their results showed the majority of those who took part had adopted preventative behaviours such as wearing face masks and washing hands. However men and young people were identified as important groups to target for behaviour change. The preliminary findings are part of the nationwide Covid Health and Adherence Research in Scotland (CHARIS) project. During this stage of the project, the team from the university's Institute of Applied Health Sciences focussed on adherence - looking at how well people were sticking to the rules and identifying if there were groups of people less likely to comply. The team asked their Scottish volunteers if they were sticking to social distancing guidance such as the two-metre rule, wearing face coverings in public and washing hands regularly.    They said the results showed that while the majority of Scots were following public health guidance, women were better than men and young people at following the rules. Prof Diane Dixon said: ""These initial results are encouraging in the sense that the majority of people in Scotland are adhering to the behaviours designed to protect ourselves and others from Covid-19.    ""However, our work also found that there are groups of people - men and young people - for whom this behaviour change may be proving more difficult. ""Although preliminary at this stage, it does suggest that these groups may benefit from more targeted campaigns and messaging to promote this behaviour change."" The team said handwashing, physical distancing and wearing face coverings had been adopted with a ""high degree of automaticity"", with handwashing the most established behaviour of the three, followed by face coverings and physical distancing. Dr Chantal den Daas said of adherence scales: ""Having this measurement means that we have a way in which we can look at how things are going over time, as government directions change, or as sentiments change - as people get tired of the new restrictions. ""We are also able to use it to identify groups who adhere less and explore what predicts adherence"". She said ""underlying factors"" such as having confidence in being able to stick to the rules were important. ""It was particularly interesting to find that people have a personal style such that if they adhere to one of the behaviours they are likely to adhere to all three behaviours  - physical distancing, wearing face covering, and hand washing"", she said. ""Similarly, people who keep a two-metre distance, wash their hands frequently, and wear face coverings are also more likely to stay at home or only go out for the permitted reasons.""   Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said: ""We welcome the fact that the majority of people are following the rules and this research will help inform the Scottish government's approach when asking the public to stick with it in our ongoing effort to suppress this virus. ""It emphasises the importance of research in our decision-making. Adherence to guidance and rules is a collective effort and, while it has been an extremely difficult period for everybody, we will get there faster if we all stick together.""

Man offered Covid jab after height listed as 6.2cm,"A man in his 30s with no underlying health conditions was offered a Covid vaccine after an NHS error mistakenly listed him as just 6.2cm in height. Liam Thorp was told he qualified for the jab because his measurements gave him a body mass index of 28,000. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""I've put on a few pounds in lockdown but I was surprised to have made it to clinically, morbidly-obese. ""It really made me rethink what I was going to do for pancake night."" NHS Liverpool Clinical Commissioning Group said occasional errors could happen. Dr Fiona Lemmens admitted she could ""see the funny side"" but also recognised ""there is an important issue for us to address"".  ""There are millions of GP appointments taking place every day and while we take care to make sure records are accurate, occasional data errors do occur."" Mr Thorp, 32, said he was surprised to be offered the vaccine so called his GP to check. He was then informed he was in vaccine priority group six because of his weight. The NHS says a BMI of between 30 and 39.9 is classed as obese. ""Like most people, I've put on a few pounds in lockdown but I was surprised to have made it all the way to the clinically, morbidly-obese category,"" he said. ""Although my mum wasn't surprised by this. She said she'd noticed I'd put on a few and this was probably the wake-up call I needed."" It was only when he received a call back the following day that the mix-up became clear.  Rather than being listed at 6ft 2ins in height, he was registered as 6.2cm, which led to the error in his BMI.  ""I'm a bit on the chunky side, I weigh a good 17-and-a-half stone so to combine that with the 6.2cm in height and you get a BMI of 28,000,"" said Mr Thorp, who is political editor at the Liverpool Echo newspaper. ""I felt a bit uneasy about it because I know - having reported on this extensively - how many more people should be ahead of me in the queue,"" he said. Mr Thorp has now urged others who believe there has been a mistake to always check with their GP. ""I'd much rather somebody else who needs it earlier than me got that appointment,"" he said. ""I was completely cool with it. Mistakes are going to happen in such an enormous undertaking."" Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Jersey hotels to reopen from 22 February,"Hotels in Jersey will be allowed to reopen from Monday as the government announces further easing of lockdown restrictions. The accommodation will only be open to local residents and people who are required to isolate while border controls remain in place. It will coincide with the reopening of restaurants in the island next week. The government said it would ""continue to progressively open as many sectors as we safely can"". Ministers said the decision to reopen hotels had been made following a meeting with the island's Scientific and Technical Advisory Cell and representatives from the industry. ""Rigorous rules"" would be in place for those that wish to reopen next week, with further guidance expected shortly, the government added. Murray Norton, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce, said hoteliers were having to contact suppliers within the five days notice given. ""Opening a hotel is quite a complicated scenario,"" he told the BBC. ""It's good news for everyone that we're in this position, but there will be some that feel a little bit more notice to have got themselves ready would have been helpful."" However he said there was ""serious opportunity"" for hotels to benefit from local residents looking for a break after a ""very difficult time"". Chief Minister John Le Fondre said ministers would assess whether further activities, including singing and indoor sport, could be permitted after the school half term.

City bar loses license over Covid party breach,"A city centre bar has lost its licence after police said it ""blatantly"" broke Covid-19 regulations. Video footage shared on social media showed a crowd of people singing and dancing in Bedfords bar in Norwich. The party took place just before the November lockdown, but social distancing rules were in places for pubs and clubs. Michelle Bartram, Norfolk Police licensing officer, said the footage had ""outraged"" other licensees. ""We are in unprecedented times and breaching the coronavirus restrictions is a serious matter which threatened the lives and health of those at the premises and the wider public,"" said Ms Bartram.  The owner of Bedfords, Glen Carr, who attended the Norwich City Council licensing sub-committee meeting on Wednesday, said: ""In hindsight, it probably was the wrong decision, but I think you all need to afford me a little bit of respect in that I run one of the busiest bars in the city centre. ""I've never once in my seven years had the police at my doors for trouble."" Norfolk Police said it did not take action to revoke licences lightly, adding it had worked with the night-time economy over the implementation of Covid restrictions ""to make everyone safe"". On Facebook, Mr Carr said: ""We are not done yet. We will be meeting with our legal team and barrister next week to decide what course of action we will take."" The council's public protection officer, Richard Divey said Mr Carr does have the right to appeal the revocation.  ""It doesn't mean that another management team can't come forward and reapply... to take the bar on,"" he said.  Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

Man jailed for killing wife during lockdown,"A man has been jailed for five years for killing his wife during the first coronavirus lockdown in March. Anthony Williams, 70, was found not guilty of murdering his wife Ruth, 67, at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen, after a trial at Swansea Crown Court.  But Williams, of Brynglas, Hollybush, who had anxiety and depression, admitted to manslaughter by diminished responsibility. Judge Paul Thomas said it was a ""tragic case on several levels"". During the trial, the court heard Williams had not slept for several days due to worries over money, coronavirus and his health.  A psychiatrist told the jury Williams's mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019, and the coronavirus pandemic had made things worse. He told police he had ""choked the living daylights"" out of Mrs Williams after an argument on 28 March. Mr Thomas said: ""The overwhelming greatest tragedy is that a lady of 67 years who was in good health had her life ended at the hands of a man she had loved for nearly 50 years.  ""It is also a tragedy that an act of a couple of minutes and one you immediately repented will define you for the rest of your life. And tragic that you have now left your daughter without her beloved mother.""  Mrs Williams was found slumped in the porch of their home with keys in her hand - she was later pronounced dead at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.  While being driven to the police station, Williams told officers: ""It wasn't murder and I didn't mean to murder her. ""I just flipped, it wasn't me. I wouldn't hurt a fly, it wasn't me, I'm not like that and I don't know what came over me."" During the trial, the couple's daughter, Emma, said she had told her father she feared he was ""spiralling out of control"".  She said her father told her he thought he was going to ""lose the house and not be able to pay the bills"" despite having no mortgage on their house and Â£148,000 in savings. Plaid Cymru politician Helen Mary Jones and domestic abuse campaigner Rachel Williams have been ordered to attend the same court on Thursday over Twitter messages posted during the trial. Ms Jones retweeted a post from Ms Williams which said: ""As so many of us will know, there would have been history of domestic abuse. I hope this jury finds him guilty of murder."" No evidence was heard during the trial that Williams had a history of domestic abuse and the tweet was deleted by Ms Williams on Monday.

Is vaccination slowing Scotland's Covid death rate?,"By Christopher SleightBBC Scotland news First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says that falling Covid-19 deaths in care homes and among the oldest Scots is the first ""hard evidence"" the vaccination programme is working. So, can this drop in deaths be attributed to the vaccine? First, it's worth looking at the progress made in vaccinating the oldest people in Scotland. And in short, progress has been good. All residents in care homes for older people have now been vaccinated with a first dose - more than 30,000 people - according to Scottish government figures. First doses for this group were completed last week, with the bulk of the vaccinations being done in late December and the first half of January. Using Public Health Scotland data, we can also see how many people in each age group have been vaccinated. The Scottish government is vaccinating groups of people in line with the priorities set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, so older people have been first in line for the jab. Neither the Pfizer nor Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have an immediate effect. The jabs will take two to three weeks to provide some level of protection, with maximum protection following administration of the second dose several weeks later. Because of that, an instant drop in care home deaths would not be expected. However, the latest National Records of Scotland data shows that Covid deaths in care homes are falling as a proportion of the total number of deaths. In the week beginning 28 December, 33% of all Covid deaths were in care homes. This figure has fallen every week since and last week reached 13%. There were 42 Covid-19 deaths in care homes between 8 and 14 February, out of a total of 323 deaths. Using NRS data, we can also see the number of deaths in each age group. Looking at the older age groups only, there are rises across all ages from late December, with a marked decline in deaths in the oldest age group towards the end of January. The NRS counts all death certificates that mention Covid-19 and weekly deaths seem to have risen to a peak in mid-January. Since then, weekly deaths have fallen by about 29% overall, whereas deaths in the 85+ age group have seen a 45% cut. BBC News analysis, using data from England only also suggests the vaccine is starting to push the numbers down. Coronavirus deaths are falling faster for vaccinated than unvaccinated groups. On average, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s. At this stage, it's difficult to say for certain if the data shows ""hard evidence"" that the vaccination programme is working. Referring to the English figures this week, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: ""The earliest indications would imply there is some effect. ""But I think it's too early to put a number on that. We would expect to see some evidence that is strong enough to put into the public domain in the next few weeks."" Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, strikes a similar note of caution. ""The care homes data is really good. It's the first signs that the vaccination is doing in the wild, what it did in the trials,"" he told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland. ""It's a little bit too early to say that's going to happen across all ages and all populations. So we have to be cautious."" The suppression of the virus by the current lockdown will undoubtedly be having an effect on the number of deaths. As the number of cases goes down, so the number of hospital admissions and deaths will fall. This is exactly what happened in the spring, when deaths reached very low levels following the restrictions introduced in March. Since most of Scotland has been in full lockdown since the beginning of January - with a corresponding cut in case numbers - it is hard to disentangle this from the vaccine effect. But the marked fall in care home deaths and in the over-85 age groups is encouraging, and as in England, gives some indication the vaccination programme is working.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56097899,1
Virus elimination in Scotland would 'come at cost',"Scotland could ""strive"" to eliminate Covid-19 - but at the cost of isolation, the national clinical director has said. Prof Jason Leitch warned an elimination strategy would prevent international travel to Scotland ""for some time"". He also said that elimination was not the same as ""global eradication"" of Covid-19, which would take many years. A public panel has urged the Scottish government to pursue a Covid elimination strategy. The body of 19 people was set up by Holyrood's Covid-19 Committee to provide the public's view on the government's approach to coronavirus restrictions and strategy. It has called for a plan that would try to gradually reduce the number of cases to zero. Prof Leitch told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that it was ""possible to strive"" for elimination. ""You can see countries striving very hard for elimination and getting there,"" he said. ""You might compare yourself perhaps with Norway... [It has] land borders in Europe, northern Europe, and has strived for elimination. ""You cannot travel to Norway unless you are exempt for oil and gas reasons or you have another reason for an emergency or something and they have pretty low numbers."" Prof Leitch said any ""domestic normality"" achieved by elimination would come at the cost of international travel, but told BBC Scotland it could be possible to set up ""travel corridors"" between countries that had eliminated the virus. He added: ""Elimination is not eradicating the virus. In order to be completely eradicated, we need a smallpox-style, many-years project - and the virus would probably have to help us, but we can strive for elimination."" Public health expert Dr Christine Tait-Burkard, from the University of Edinburgh, said an elimination strategy was possible in countries such as Australia and New Zealand because international travel could be more easily controlled. But she said it would be hard to achieve similar results in the UK. ""It is a very difficult strategy to pursue and in my opinion it's near impossible, just because we live in a very multi-cultural society and have very close links to the continent. ""That's a bit different from Australia and New Zealand, where these strategies are indeed quite feasible because the only ports are by air or by boat. ""With the UK those links are very close and people can travel very easily."" Dr Tait Burkard said that ""very stringent lockdowns"", as seen recently in Melbourne and Auckland, were also a key part of any elimination strategy. She told Good Morning Scotland that vaccination offered another route out of lockdown. ""We are on a good way to having vaccinated,"" she said. ""So, potentially, in my opinion, we just have to start to live with the virus, carefully weighing out all the negatives. ""But the reality of the virus being so widespread across the globe means that this virus is here to stay.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56110282,1
Almost 2 million 'have not worked for six months',"Almost two million people have not worked for at least six months due to the economic impact of the pandemic, according to a report. Those people affected were either unemployed or fully furloughed, the Resolution Foundation think tank said. It is calling for the furlough scheme to remain in place for several months after lockdown restrictions are eased. The Treasury said the government would continue to invest in protecting and creating jobs.  The Resolution Foundation said that of the nearly two million people affected, the majority have been on full-time furlough or have gone from furlough to unemployment and back, while another 700,000 have been officially unemployed. Among those workers currently employed, 8% either expect to lose their jobs in the next three months, or have been told that they will be made redundant, the think tank added. Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""While the UK's economic prospects are finally looking up, job insecurity remains high, particularly among those who have spent long periods not working, or who are currently furloughed."" The furlough scheme, which partially covers the wages of people placed on leave, has already been extended through to April.  The Resolution Foundation called on the government to keep the scheme in place for several months after public health restrictions have been lifted, giving employers time to recover and bring staff back. It said support should be tailored to sectors of the economy which have been the hardest hit, such as hospitality. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""Throughout this crisis, we have done all we can to support jobs and livelihoods, spending over Â£280bhn in response to the pandemic."" ""We will continue to invest in protecting and creating jobs through the remainder of the pandemic and through the recovery, and we will set out further details via the next stage of our plan for jobs at the upcoming Budget."" The Resolution Foundation's recommendation echoes calls made earlier this week by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) and Citi Research. The IFS warned that lower-income households faced a higher risk of unemployment this year, as ""deferred"" company failures take place after the furlough scheme ends. It said that it was vital to ensure that the furlough scheme and other government support was unwound gently, rather than coming to an abrupt halt. However, IFS and Citi also said that the economy would not be able to adjust properly as long as the furlough scheme is still in place. How high could the unemployment rate go?

The bank reported a 30% fall in pre-tax profits to Â£3.1bn for 2020, down from Â£4.3bn in 2019. It was forced to set aside Â£4.8bn to cover loans unlikely to be paid back amid the economic fallout of Covid. Despite that the bank announced it would resume dividends, with a payment of 1p per share to shareholders. The bank has been one of the biggest providers of emergency loans during the coronavirus crisis, having given some Â£27bn worth to businesses. It has also provided more than 680,000 payment holidays globally for customers with mortgages, credit cards and loans. Barclays warned that pandemic-related costs would remain high throughout the coming year, but that it expected loan loss charges to be ""materially below"" last year's hit. Some Â£492m was set aside to cover expected defaults by borrowers in the final three months of 2020, but that was down nearly a fifth on the previous quarter. Barclays added that investment banking trading had helped to offset the impact of the Covid crisis on its retail arm, with its ""best ever year"" for markets and banking income helping to keep the group in profit. ""We expect that our resilient and diversified business model will deliver a meaningful improvement in returns in 2021,"" group chief executive Jes Staley said. Banking analyst Philip Augar told the BBC's Today programme that ""it's clearly not great news"" for the bank. ""I suppose the consolation for the economy and for Barclays shareholders is that it could have been worse. ""The amount that they've been providing against bad loans has been less, quarter by quarter, and that might be a sign that we're past the worst, but they're pretty cautious in what they say."" He added that he felt it was ""prudent"" for the bank to resume dividends payments to shareholders, after regulators permitted this in December. Banks had been told to stop making the payments in March last year in order to build up capital to absorb potential loan losses caused by the pandemic. In addition to the dividend, Barclays is also set to return cash to investors via a share buyback (where companies listed on the stock market purchase some of their own shares) of up to Â£700m. In its annual report published alongside the results on Thursday, Barclays revealed its staff bonus pool was 6% higher than the Â£1.5bn shared out in 2019. It said this represented a ""relatively modest increase across the investment banking businesses, reductions for all other businesses and appropriate recognition for the contributions of our more junior colleagues"". Mr Staley took home Â£4.01m last year, although that was down on the Â£5.9m paid out in 2019. Dividends and bonuses against the backdrop of the coronavirus crisis will remain in sharp focus this week. State-backed banking giant NatWest is also set to report its annual results on Friday. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said that coronavirus vaccine developments had boosted the outlook for the economy and banks. ""Should the rollout of the vaccine lead to a quicker than expected economic recovery, it could even result in provisions for bad debts being significantly lower than the ones the banks announced last year."" But he warned: ""Headwinds remain for the sector in light of historically low interest rates, which put severe downward pressure on margins.""

"Don't abandon 'long Covid' key workers, MPs say","Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to compensate key workers suffering from ""long Covid"". A total of 65 MPs and peers have signed a letter to the PM, asking for it to be recognised as an occupational disease. Layla Moran, who chairs a committee of MPs looking into coronavirus, said the government should not abandon ""the true heroes of the pandemic"". The government has said it will invest Â£18.5m into four studies looking at the longer term effects of Covid. Long Covid presents as a range of different symptoms suffered by people weeks or months after being infected with the virus - some of whom weren't seriously ill when they had it.  According to the British Medical Journal, it is thought to occur in approximately 10% of people infected - but that number only represents those who have been tested, meaning some who caught the virus in the early stages of the pandemic will be missing from the figures. Ms Moran said many key workers who were suffering from long Covid now found returning to work ""nearly impossible"". The Liberal Democrat MP suggested they should receive regular monthly payments, but said the amount should vary according to individual circumstances. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""These are people who we went out to clap for every Thursday evening... and find themselves unable to do their work, having spent their time saving lives. It is entirely right to protect their livelihoods."" Ms Moran said there were ""205 identified symptoms that go with long Covid"", and that it affected all parts of the population, including healthy adults and children. She and other MPs are calling for a ""symptoms-based"" national register to document how many people in the UK are living with long Covid - which would help estimate the cost of the scheme.  The letter to Mr Johnson, organised by the All Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus - led by Ms Moran - says approximately 390,000 people will have long Covid in the UK. The cross-party group of MPs - backed by the British Medical Association and members of the House of Lords - wants the government to follow the example of countries including Spain, France, Germany, Belgium and Denmark, which formally recognise Covid as an ""occupational disease"". By defining it in this way, employees and their dependents would be entitled to protection and compensation if they contracted the virus while working.  They first made the call in January and wrote to the PM again last week to push forward the campaign, saying any delays to such a scheme would be a ""dereliction of duty and amounts to abandoning the very people to whom we owe the most"" - but they are yet to receive a reply. Iona Fabian loves her job as a secondary school teacher. But after contracting Covid in March 2020, she fears for her future. ""Like many people who got it in March, I didn't know that is what I had,"" the 52-year-old said. ""I mostly had a very sore throat and just felt very, very tired, so I just took to my bed for three or four days."" Iona felt like she had recovered but gradually her symptoms got worse, and come June, she ""suddenly went down like a ton of bricks"" and could not get out of bed for weeks.  ""I was just staying alive at that point,"" she said. ""As the weeks went on it felt like being slowly erased, all your plans and all the things you normally do in your life being taken away one by one."" Doctors told her it was long Covid and the impact on her life, and her work, has been stark ever since. ""I tried to do a phased return to work in September, but realised I could barely stand up and I was white as a sheet,"" she said.  ""It is one thing going back to work in lockdown, but different than it will be in real life because of the physicality of standing up, as breathing and walking is really, really difficult."" Iona is now joining the calls to make long Covid an occupational disease and to give those key workers with it more support. Ms Moran said long Covid was ""the hidden health crisis of the pandemic"". ""When it comes to frontline NHS, care and key workers, they were specifically asked to go to work and save lives while everyone else was asked to stay at home,"" she said. ""They are the true heroes of the pandemic and, sadly, many have developed the debilitating effects of long Covid, meaning that they are unable to return to full time work.  ""The government cannot abandon them now or ever."" Tory MP and doctor Dan Poulter, who is the vice-chair of the group, added: ""The government asked frontline medical staff and key workers to look after us during the pandemic. ""Now it is government's turn to look after the heroes of the pandemic by launching a comprehensive compensation scheme for those of them living with long Covid."" The campaign has the backing of the British Medical Association, with the chair of its council, Dr Chaand Nagpaul, saying the ""debt of gratitude"" owed to key workers ""cannot be underestimated"". He said: ""While the government and employers must increase efforts to protect staff now and stop them contracting Covid-19 in the first place, for some it is already too late.  ""So it is only right that ministers urgently provide a compensation scheme to support healthcare staff and their families who are now living with the devastating after-effects of Covid-19."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said the ""indiscriminate and lasting impact"" Covid-19 can have should act as a ""clear reminder to everyone"" to follow the guidance and restrictions. ""We are grateful for the hard work and dedication of our health and social care staff throughout the pandemic and it is important that staff are treated fairly, and employers make full use of the existing sick pay provisions on offer to support staff,"" he added. ""We are continuing to work with our outstanding scientists to improve our collective understanding of the impact long Covid has on people of all ages - making sure we deliver the best support possible to affected individuals.""

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening.  There has been a ""strong decline"" in levels of coronavirus infections in England since January, according to scientists working on Imperial College London's regular React study. Tests among 85,000 randomly selected people between 4 and 13 February suggest infections have dropped by two-thirds across England since lockdown began. However, the study indicates virus levels are still high, with one in 200 testing positive. Boris Johnson is facing pressure to compensate key workers suffering from ""long Covid"", with 65 MPs and peers signing a letter to the prime minister calling for it to be recognised as an occupational disease. Layla Moran, who chairs a committee of MPs looking into coronavirus, says ministers should not abandon ""the true heroes of the pandemic"". The Department of Health says employers should ""make full use"" of existing support for staff. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says falling numbers of Covid-19 deaths in care homes and among the oldest citizens provide ""hard evidence"" the vaccination programme is working. Can this drop in deaths be attributed to the vaccine, or could there be another cause? We examine the data. The pandemic has transformed the working world for many of us, forcing companies and employees to adapt. We hear from a single mum juggling work with home-schooling and a supermarket manager who says he suddenly took on responsibilities for health and safety, crowd management and even counselling staff. A video with celebrities including Romesh Ranganathan, Meera Syal and Sanjeev Bhaskar (below, from left) urging people from ethnic minority communities to get the Covid vaccine will be shown across the UK's main commercial TV channels. It will be screened on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 at 21:56 GMT, as well as on STV and various Sky channels.

"Aviation factory could close, threatening 99 jobs","By Garry OwenBBC News Almost 100 jobs could be lost at a factory in south Wales which makes passenger aircraft cabin interiors. AIM Altitude said it was consulting with 99 employees who work at its Dafen site in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire. The firm, based in Bournemouth, said closing the factory was an option as it responded to ""unprecedented and major challenges"" to the sector. The Welsh Government said it had ""been in touch"" with the company with a view to keeping jobs in Llanelli. ""The coronavirus pandemic has created unprecedented and major challenges for the airline industry and, in line with other companies in the aerospace sector, AIM Altitude's production has been adversely affected by the situation,"" the company said. It pointed out it had already taken other measures, including making use of the UK government furlough scheme, reducing overhead costs and receiving support from shareholders. The statement added: ""Unfortunately, there is a need to reduce the workforce to reflect the fall in demand and address the cost base."" Its consultation will consider the ""possible closure"" of the factory, and ""consolidation"" to its main manufacturing base in Dorset. Lee Waters, who represents Llanelli in the Senedd and is deputy minister for the economy and transport, said it was important to keep the jobs in the area. ""These are good quality jobs and I'm keen they are not lost to the area,"" he told the BBC Radio Cymru Dros Frecwast programme.

Key worker virus testing programme starts,"A programme to test if key workers with no symptoms of Covid are unknowingly spreading the virus has been launched.  Swindon Borough Council is testing carers and other people who cannot work from home in an attempt to break chains of transmission.  All 1,500 appointments at Foundation Park and Waterside Park are by appointment only. About one in three people who have the virus display no symptoms.  Steve Maddern, Swindon Borough Council's director of public health, said of about 100 tests undertaken since Monday none had shown a positive test. He said that was ""really positive to see"" and that shows that community transmission was declining.  The tests generate results within about half an hour and do not require laboratory equipment.  All people with forthcoming appointments have been contacted but the council said it was hopeful of offering more tests as capacity increases.  Tim Saint, 51, from Swindon, who works helping carers, said he was happy to be able to give people ""reassurance"" after he tested negative. Brian Ford, Swindon Borough Council's cabinet member for adults and health, said: ""It's been all hands on deck to get the symptom-free testing programme up and running over the last few weeks.

Artist says his mental health was 'saved' by music,"A musician who had severe anxiety and depression has said music ""saved"" his life during the pandemic. Tom Corneill was made redundant just before the first lockdown and restrictions meant he could not perform leaving him in a ""dark place"". He said: ""It got to the point where I had to answer questions about suicidal thoughts and that's a scary place."" He has launched a new band and mental health podcast and wants to ""tell the world"" how art can help wellbeing. The Somerset musician worked in investment for 12 years before being made redundant in January 2020 while he was struggling with his mental health. He had also just quit the band he had been in for 11 years and describes the onset of the pandemic as feeling like he had ""lost everything"". He said: ""I couldn't do anything, I was becoming more and more locked into some really dark days. ""I got to a point thinking how much further will this go before something terrible happens to me?"" Towards the end of 2020, Mr Corneill started a new band called Young Martyrs and released his podcast on mental health called Everyday Problems. He said it ""massively helped"" him and his band members, who had also been affected by the events sector shutting down, with their well-being. ""Rediscovering I had music saved my life and I'm now doing music full-time and have turned my life around, I have a new lease of life."" The coronavirus pandemic has led to concerns about how people's mental health has been affected. Many of those who work in the events sector and have lost their livelihoods have been struggling as a result. Mr Corneill added: ""I'm on a mission to let the world know how important it is to do something everyday that means you're being true to yourself and for me that was music.

Alderney cafe 'excited' to reopen for takeaway,"Alderney has begun to relax lockdown rules as it enters stage one of the Bailiwick of Guernsey's exit strategy. The change means takeaways and non-essential delivery services can open, bubbles of two households are allowed and up to five people can meet outside. One cafe owner said she was ""very excited"" to serve customers again. Jade Maguire, who runs The Moorings, said: ""I'm looking forward to a break from the monotony and getting stuck back into things."" Alderney's lockdown began after the bailiwick was put into a lockdown on 23 January, following an outbreak of Covid-19 in Guernsey. The island recorded its first case of the virus since the pandemic began on 5 February. Guernsey is due to enter stage one on Monday. The easing of lockdown will also mean an increase in the amount of time people are allowed to exercise outdoors. The restriction will move from the current two hours of exercise time to four. Ms Maguire's business will reopen for deliveries on Friday, rather than the first day possible, in order to prepare and ensure they can comply with public health rules to keep staff and customers safe.  She said: ""It's good not to rush these things. We've been shut for a month now. ""We want to make sure everything is spick and span and 100% ensure that we're adhering to the guidelines before we get any staff into the building."" Ms Maguire said she was ""slightly concerned"" about the number of people who might want their first takeaway since January. She said the current plan to ""manage expectations"" and any potential rush on the menus was to have people pre-order their food in advance and book a time slot for delivery on the day.  ""There's probably a lot of people on the island wanting a good pizza or burger and not needing to cook,"" she said. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Lockdown diaries: 'I'm not achieving anything',"Single mother-of-four Vicky Price lives in Henleaze, Bristol and has been juggling running her own business with home-schooling and somehow maintaining a home life for the past three lockdowns. Now she says she has ""totally had enough"" and feels like she is ""not achieving anything"" any more. This is lockdown in her own words. ""I've had lots of 'not-so-good' days.   ""I've been up since five working because I'm just so behind, and the house is a mess because I'm so behind.

Ethnicity vaccine gaps persist in over-70s,"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  Black and mixed heritage people in their 70s are being vaccinated against Covid-19 at much lower rates than white people, GP records suggest. And fewer Bangladeshi and Pakistani people had been jabbed by 11 February. This follows data from earlier in the vaccination programme showing similar gaps among the over-80s. A discrepancy was not seen in the over-70s at that point, but this is most likely because very few were being vaccinated at that stage. The findings come from a study called OpenSafely, run by the University of Oxford and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  The team has access to completely anonymised medical records covering 40% of GP practices in England.  It comes as a star-filled video urging people from ethnic minority communities to get the Covid vaccine is set to be shown across the UK's main commercial TV channels. The GP records reveal differences in vaccination coverage between people with different ethnic backgrounds, levels of deprivation and health conditions.  Among those aged 70 to 79 - who began receiving the jab from mid-January - white people were most likely to have been vaccinated, with 86% jabbed by 11 February. By comparison, only 55% of black 70- to 79-year-olds, 68% of people with mixed heritage and 73% of people from South Asian backgrounds had received the jab by that point.  These records covered people not living in care homes.  Within those broad categories there were further differences, for example 49% of people describing their ethnicity as African had been vaccinated compared with 59% from Caribbean backgrounds.  And among South Asian people in this age group, 60% of those who described themselves as Pakistani or British Pakistani had been jabbed compared with 64% of Bangladeshi people their 70s and 80% of Indian or British Indian people.  However, much of that gap closes once you look at people living in care homes. There, 87% of white people, 70% of black people and 79% of South Asian people had been vaccinated by about the first week of February.  Ethnicity was the most significant factor in people's likelihood of having received the vaccine.  Prof Stephen Evans, one of the scientists leading the project, said it was not possible to say what was behind these differences - to get at that, you'd have to know who had been offered vaccines as well as who had received them. This coverage data ""mixes up"" vaccine hesitancy with people who hadn't received an invitation and those with issues accessing a vaccine centre once invited, he explained. ""We can't distinguish between these things,"" Prof Evans said.  He pointed out the vaccination programme was moving very quickly and the picture might change.  While the study has an unusually large sample, its coverage of London GP practices is considerably lower at 17%. But the study leads said this was unlikely to affect the overall picture, which was weighted to adjust for different population sizes. There were also differences in vaccination coverage between people from the most and least deprived areas, but that gap was smaller - ranging between 79% and 89% coverage.  In general, people with health conditions were as or more likely than their peers to have been vaccinated. This included people taking medication for common mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. But people aged 70-79 with psychosis, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were less likely (74%) to have received the vaccine compared with those without one of these diagnoses (85%).

'Clothes should float in and out of our lives',"By Katherine LathamBusiness reporter The coronavirus pandemic has badly damaged economies across the world. Could an increased move towards a ""circular economy"" model aid the recovery? That is the suggestion of a new report by academics from five countries around the globe. But what exactly is a circular economy? In simple terms, it means that products are made from recycled materials, and they themselves are intended to be easily reused or recycled. Hence a circle is formed. ""Products float seamlessly in and out of our lives as needed, without creating waste,"" says Kristy Caylor, founder of US clothing firm For Days. That is how she describes the economic model. Her Los Angeles-based company is a zero-waste firm. Its customers are encouraged to mail in their old clothes (either from For Days, or their wider wardrobe) for money-off vouchers on new items. For Days then recycles all the material, turning the cotton into its new clothes. Nothing ends up in landfill, and the company is carbon neutral too. ""We believe that the circular economy provides an opportunity to innovate, driving superior business results, and better customer loyalty,"" adds Ms Caylor. ""If we can align incentives for customers, business and the planet - that's the win."" UK think tank, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, has been a leading proponent of the circular economy model since it was founded in 2010 by the former sailor of the same name. Last year it published a study saying that countries moving towards circular economies could drive the post-pandemic recovery. It points to investment opportunities across five sectors - buildings, fashion, food, plastic packaging, and cars.  Specific projects highlighted include using more recycled steel in construction that it says would reduce material costs by 25%, and a big increase in the use of returnable packaging. It forecasts the later could become a $50bn (Â£36bn) global industry by 2026. ""We have an opportunity to usher in growth,"" says Jocelyn Bleriot, the foundation's executive officer. ""Now is the time to move away from a system that creates value by consuming finite resources."" Swedish furniture giant Ikea says it aims to become a purely circular business by 2030. Last November it opened its first second hand-only store in a shopping centre in the Swedish city of Eskilstuna. The ""pop-up"" shop will be open until May. Jonas Carlehed, Ikea's sustainable manager for Sweden, says the firm's long-term aim for the business is ""raw materials recycled, remanufactured, refurbished, reused"". He adds: ""Our second-hand store is a wonderful example of our goal to become circular. We aim to create an attractive and profitable business model."" Last month's academic report into circular economies was co-written by researchers from universities in the UK, Japan, Malaysia, Nigeria and the United Arab Emirates. Co-author Dr Khameel Mustapha, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Nottingham University, says those who adopt circular economies will have an advantage as the benefits ""become supremely obvious"". In the US, one firm aiming to harvest this advantage is Empire State Greenhouses. It is building a solar-powered greenhouse or ""organic crop factory"" in upstate New York. The facility will also turn manure from local cows into C02 to fertilise the plants, and natural gas for home heating ""Energy is the elephant in the room,"" says the firm's fonder Louis Ferro. ""Energy usage throughout the food value chain accounts for 34 cents of every dollar spent by consumers. ""By eliminating energy costs we can achieve extraordinary margins that traditional growers cannot compete with."" So are we on the verge of a seismic shift? Dr Ross Brown, lecturer in entrepreneurship and small business at the University of St Andrews, is not convinced. ""While it [a circular economy model] is feasible for certain aspects of modern-day economies, it is highly unrealistic for others,"" he says. ""In many instances firms just do not have the logistical capabilities of coordinating mass product reuse or remanufacturing."" For this reason he believes that the model will remain niche: ""I seriously doubt it will ever become fully mainstream."" New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. Another pitfall could be if the price of recycling is higher than the value of recycled goods. ""In today's environment, recycling is indeed very costly and for most applications it cannot compete,"" says Jessica Stewart, associate at global sustainability consulting and investment firm SystemIQ. She says recycling costs would fall significantly if more firms adopted a circular model, ""driving massive economic benefit"". SystemIQ argues that an industry-wide circular approach to the global plastics sector has the potential to create 700,000 jobs, and generate savings of $200bn per year. ""How to reduce the cost of recycling? By designing for recycling, scaling recycling infrastructure and investing in research and development, for example in advanced or automated sorting,"" says Ms Stewart. ""And how to increase the value of recycled content? Through regulation that incentivises recycled content either by setting minimum recycled content requirements or providing tax incentives. And through better design - for example, removing pigments."" An increasing number of firms both large and small are taking the circular economy message on board. For example, fast-food giant Burger King is soon to allow customers in New York, Tokyo and Portland to buy burgers and drinks in reusable packaging. And thousands of miles way in Kenya, a firm called Safi Organics is turning food waste into fertiliser, which is helping to reduce the volume that the country has to import. Matthew Banton, global head of innovation and sustainability at Burger King, says: ""We've experienced challenges during the pandemic that have taught us to think smarter and more efficiently."" Back at clothing retailer For Days, Ms Caylor hopes the pandemic will result in a sea change: ""We are at a very early stage, but circular economy is finally a topic making main stages globally. and I hope the attention leads to investment and adoption more broadly.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56083625,1

But she was unable to return to Liverpool at the beginning of January, because travel was restricted from Tier 4 areas, as the capital had become. ""We've been expected to pay Â£1,897 for January and there is another rent instalment of Â£1,541 due in April,"" the second year student tells the BBC. ""I told my accommodation I was unable to travel back as my course is not essential and there will be no future face-to-face teaching for this academic year. ""But they just suggested: 'You can return to use your accommodation for personal study'."" Even though people are receiving fines for travelling for non-essential reasons, she says the landlord insists it isn't against the law. ""They expect my flatmate and me to pay the full amount without any reductions, which is causing me stress and anxiety, especially as I am also having to help with rent and bills at home,"" Ms Cooper says. According to government guidance, most students will not be able to return to university until at least 8 March, with the exception of groups including medical, education, and policing students. Ms Cooper is not alone in being put under financial pressure during these difficult times. Only about one in 20 students with private landlords has got a refund for accommodation they haven't been able to use, according to campaign group Save The Student. Its research suggests students have been forced to fork out nearly Â£1bn for accommodation they've been unable to use during the 2020-21 academic year. On average they've lost out Â£1,621, the group reckons. ""Â£1bn is a huge price for students to pay and the total will keep going up, making it clear once again that students are among the worst affected by the coronavirus pandemic,"" says Jake Butler, Save the Student's money expert. ""A lot of accommodation providers, particularly universities, have reacted well but many students, mostly those renting from private landlords, have been left without a leg to stand on."" Student and freelance journalist Josh Sandiford is from Birmingham and in his third year at Manchester University, studying politics and economics. He told BBC Radio 4's You & Yours programme that he has lost about Â£4,500 in rent in the current academic year. He and his friends signed for the student property during the first national lockdown in 2020, expecting to return to university in September. But due to coronavirus restrictions, Josh hasn't been back since. And as he wasn't available for the original viewing, he's never even seen the property. ""I'm now in the unfortunate position of having to pay thousands of pounds for a property that I've never even been to,"" he says. Having contacted his landlord, he was offered the opportunity to find someone to take up his room rental instead - rather than a rent reduction. Although he says the conversation was ""positive"", he feels it's ""unfair"" he's still having to pay for a room he has never used. ""Students have been consistently exploited and ignored during this pandemic,"" said Hillary Gyebi-Ababio, NUS vice president for higher education. ""We are seen as cash cows, with many stuck paying extortionate rents for properties they either cannot use or cannot afford."" Campaigners say the government has promised to look at the poor situation students are in ""but we're yet to see any effective action"", said Mr Butler.  ""I would urge the government to work with landlords and universities to offer students financial support to cover any rent payments for accommodation that cannot be accessed,"" he said. Maya Cooper is also looking to MPs for help. ""My flatmate and I have contacted the shadow minister for Further Education and a local MP about the issue.  ""We've even offered for my dad to remove my belongings from my room as he lives in Liverpool but even after that, my accommodation said they wouldn't allow any reduction to the rent.""

Covid and suicide: Japan's 'disappearing' women,"By Rupert Wingfield-HayesBBC News, Tokyo Japan reports suicides faster and more accurately than anywhere else in the world. Unlike most countries, here they are compiled at the end of every month. During the Covid pandemic the numbers have told a disturbing story.  In 2020, for the first time in 11 years, suicide rates in Japan went up. Most surprising, while male suicides fell slightly, rates among women surged nearly 15%.  In one month, October, the female suicide rate in Japan went up by more than 70%, compared with the same month in the previous year.  What is going on? And why does the Covid pandemic appear to be hitting women so much worse than men?  Warning: Some may find the content of this story upsetting Meeting face-to-face with a young woman who has repeatedly tried to kill herself is a troubling experience. It has given me new respect for those who work on suicide prevention.  I am sitting in a walk-in centre in Yokohama's red-light district, run by a suicide prevention charity called the Bond Project.   Across the table is a 19-year-old woman, with bobbed hair. She sits motionless. Quietly, without any emotion, she starts to tell me her story. It started when she was 15, she says. Her older brother began violently abusing her. Eventually she ran away from home, but it didn't end the pain and the loneliness.  Ending her life seemed the only way out.   ""From about this time last year I have been in and out of hospital many times,"" she tells me. ""I tried many times to kill myself, but I couldn't succeed, so now I guess I have given up trying to die."" What stopped her was the intervention of the Bond Project. They found her a safe place to live, and began giving her intensive counselling.  Jun Tachibana is the founder of the Bond Project. She is a tough woman in her 40s with relentless optimism. ""When girls are in real trouble and in pain, they really don't know what to do,"" she says. ""We are here, ready to listen to them, to tell them - we are here with you."" Ms Tachibana says Covid seems to be pushing those who are already vulnerable closer to the edge.  She describes some of the harrowing calls her staff have received in recent months.   ""We hear lots of 'I want to die' and 'I have no place to go',"" she says. ""They say 'It is so painful, I am so lonely I want to disappear'.""   For those suffering physical or sexual abuse, Covid has made the situation much worse.  ""A girl I talked to the other day said she is getting sexually harassed by her father,"" Ms Tachibana tells me. ""But because of Covid her father is not working so much and is at home a lot, so there is no escape from him."" If you look at previous times of crisis in Japan, such as the 2008 banking crisis or the collapse of Japan's stock market and property bubble in the early 1990s, the impact was largely felt by middle aged men. Large spikes were seen in male suicide rates.  But Covid is different, it is affecting young people and, in particular, young women. The reasons are complex.  Japan used to have the highest suicide rate in the developed world. Over the last decade it has had great success in reducing suicide rates by around a third.  Professor Michiko Ueda is one of Japan's leading experts on suicide. She tells me how shocking it has been to witness the sharp reverse in the last few months.  ""This pattern of female suicides is very, very unusual,"" she tells me.  ""I have never seen this much [of an] increase in my career as a researcher on this topic. The thing about the coronavirus pandemic is the industries hit most are industries staffed by women, such as tourism and retail and the food industries."" Japan has seen a large rise in single women living alone, many of them choosing that over marriage which entails quite traditional gender roles still. Prof Ueda says young women are also far more likely to be in so-called precarious employment.  ""A lot of women are not married anymore,"" she says. ""They have to support their own lives and they don't have permanent jobs. So, when something happens, of course, they are hit very, very hard. The number of job losses among non-permanent staff are just so, so large over the last eight months."" One month really stands out. In October last year, 879 women killed themselves. That is more than 70% higher than the same month in 2019.  Newspaper headlines sounded the alarm. Some compared the total number of suicides by men and women in October (2,199) to the total number of deaths in Japan from Coronavirus up to that point (2,087).   Something particularly strange was happening.   On 27 September last year, a very famous and popular actress named Yuko Takeuchi was found dead at her home. It was later reported that she had taken her own life.  Yasuyuki Shimizu is a former journalist who now runs a non-profit organisation (NPO) dedicated to combatting Japan's suicide problem. ""From the day the news of a celebrity suicide is reported, the number of suicides increases and stays that way for about 10 days,"" he says.  ""From the data we can see that the suicide of the actress on 27 September led to an extra 207 female suicides in the next 10 days."" If you look at the data for suicides by women around the same age as Yuko Takeuchi, the statistics are even more stark.  ""Women in their 40s were most influenced out of all the age groups,"" Mr Shimizu says. ""For that group it (the suicide rate) more than doubled.""  Other experts agree that there is a very strong connection between celebrity suicides and an immediate uptick in suicides in the days following. This phenomenon is not unique to Japan, and it is one reason why reporting on suicide is so difficult. In the immediate aftermath of a celebrity suicide, the more it is discussed in the media, and on social media, the greater the impact on other vulnerable people.  One of the NPO's researchers is Mai Suganuma. She is herself a victim of suicide. When she was a teenager, her father took his own life. Now she helps to support the families of others who have killed themselves.  And just as Covid is leaving relatives unable to grieve for those who have succumbed to the virus, so it is making life for the families of suicide victims much more difficult.  ""When I talk to the family members, their feeling of not being able to save the loved one is very strong, which often results in them blaming themselves."" Mai Suganuma tells me. ""I too blamed myself for not being able to save my father.  ""Now they are being told they must stay at home. I worry the feelings of guilt will grow stronger. Japanese people don't talk about death to begin with. We do not have a culture to talk about the suicides.""   Japan is now in a so-called third wave of Covid infections, and the government has ordered a second state of emergency. It is likely to be extended well into February. More restaurants and hotels and bars are closing their doors. More people are losing their jobs.  For Prof Ueda there is another nagging question. If this is happening in Japan, with no strict lockdowns, and relatively few Covid deaths, then what is happening in other countries where the pandemic is much worse?

How many people have been vaccinated in Scotland?,"In Scotland 1,320,074 people have officially received the first dose of the Covid vaccine and 20,409 have received a second dose, according to Scottish government figures. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said this week that there was now ""hard evidence"" that vaccinations were reducing the Covid death toll. This page looks at the key vaccine data in Scotland. Figures were last updated at 14:00 on 17 February. In Scotland 47,800 people per day were vaccinated over the week to 16 February. The Scottish government said it was satisfied it had met its target to vaccinate 1.1 million in the four highest priority groups by 15 February. By then all people aged over 70, care home residents, front-line health and social care staff and the clinically extremely vulnerable should have been offered a first dose. The first Covid-19 vaccinations in Scotland were given on 8 December 2020.  The vaccination rate was lower in December and early January when the jab was prioritised for care home residents. The Scottish government said this made initial distribution slower. This rate increased in late January and February when the vaccination programme expanded into communities. Vaccination progress is changeable, and can be affected by available supplies and additional capacity as new vaccination centres open. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are being distributed. Both require two doses.  Scotland has given a first dose to 1,320,074 people. This is 29% of the population aged 16 and over. A second vaccination dose has been given to 20,409 people. This is 0.45% of over-16s. For the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the second dose can be given between three to 12 weeks after the first dose.  For the AstraZeneca vaccine, the second dose can be given four to 12 weeks after the first dose. According to the Scottish government's weekly figures, 94.2% of people over 80 had been vaccinated by 14 February.  Over-70s vaccinations had reached 88.9%. Other age groups remained much lower as older people were prioritised. The priority groups have been set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). When those most at risk have been vaccinated, the Scottish government vaccine deployment plan will then move on to younger age groups. The Scottish government set a 5 February target for the top JCVI priority groups covering care home residents, frontline health workers and the over-80s. A target of mid-February was set for the over-70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable. People aged over 65 have a target of early March. People over 50 and anyone over 16 with underlying health conditions have a target of early May. The vaccine will then be rolled-out to Scotland's remaining over-18 adult population. NHS Western Isles has vaccinated the highest percentage of its population with 44% of over-16s given a first dose by 14 February.  Lothian has vaccinated the lowest percentage, covering 21.9% of people.

Mass vaccination centres at Edinburgh International Conference Centre (EICC) and Aberdeen's P&J Live opened on 1 February. Edinburgh EICC can vaccinate more than 21,000 people a week, while the Aberdeen facility will vaccinate about 6,000 every week.

Quarantine hotel rooms are 'like a prison',"By Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent, BBC News Quarantine hotels in the UK opened to their first guests on Monday, but some guests staying in them have expressed concerns about their safety, the cost and whether the system works.  Everyone who has visited or transited through 33 countries on the UK's ""red list"" who arrive in England must stay 11 nights in a quarantine hotel.  One guest said it was ""like prison"". People travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England. In Scotland, any international arrivals have to stay in a hotel, regardless of which country they arrive from and there are currently no international flights into Northern Ireland or Wales. Wilber Santos was among the first passengers to arrive in the UK on Monday morning from a red list country. He had travelled from Brazil, where he was looking after his elderly parents, via Madrid and on to Heathrow.  Although he says he is not against quarantine hotels and fully understands the need to isolate, he felt that the system was flawed: ""On board the plane from Madrid I was sitting with people who had not been in a high-risk country. 'When we arrived, I had to board a crowded transit shuttle to the terminal. It was absolutely packed with people, some from high-risk countries, others from lower risk. It is a frustrating system, it doesn't follow logic."" Heathrow airport says the process the government has designed ""triages passengers at Heathrow between aircraft gate and the immigration hall, where those from the red list are directed into a dedicated channel"". Mr Santos says he ran into problems with the system before his journey began.  All arrivals to the UK must fill in a passenger locator form stating their contact details and whether they have been in a red list country in the last 10 days. But while filing out the form, Mr Santos said the system was caught in a technical loop which meant he wasn't able to complete all his details. ""When I arrived at the border, the immigration staff were very aggressive. I tried to explain the situation, but was repeatedly told 'you have to pay a fine'. It was the first day of the policy, I understand they need to do their job, but there has to be some humanity in the system.""  The government said in response that ""the pre-departures website is clear that anyone experiencing difficulties with the passenger locator form can call the form and self-isolation helpline for guidance"".  It added: ""Every step is taken to reduce risks throughout the journey, including Covid-19 tests prior to departure, mandatory mask wearing, social distancing and regular cleaning of facilities."" After an hour of discussion, Mr Santos says that he was given an iPad and able to complete the form. ""There was a lot of confusion at the border. Some people didn't know about the policy. One man was crying as he said he had no money to pay for the hotel."" Others arriving in the UK were taken by surprise by the measures. Mohammed Mostafa travelled to London after visiting family in Bangladesh. While the country is not on the red list, Mr Mostafa transited through the UAE which is: ""It was absolutely shocking and I felt quite intimidated as well,"" Mr Mostafa told AFP news.  ""It's such a big mess. I came from a country that's not on the red list, so why should I be in this situation? I don't get that. ""I do completely agree with the idea as a theory but the way it has been implemented is utterly incompetent."" An 11-night stay in a quarantine hotel costs Â£1,750 for a single person in one room and is paid for by the passenger.  Around five hours after landing in the UK, Mr Santos arrived at his hotel, the Radisson Blu: ""I don't think the staff at the hotel have had enough training to handle this operation and that makes me feel very unsafe.  ""On Tuesday morning, I was handed my breakfast by a member of staff not wearing a mask. I am surrounded by other guests on this corridor and if each one opens the door to him, the virus could spread."" The Radisson Hotels group have said ""all staff at our properties have been trained in the Radisson Hotels Safety Protocol which includes mandatory use of PPE along with sanitation and hygiene procedures, as well as regular training for all staff on these procedures"".  It said it would investigate the incident, and, in the ""unlikely event this would have been the case, rectify any reported issues as quickly as possible"". Mr Mostafa is staying at the Holiday Inn hotel: ""[My hotel room] is simply like a prison,"" he said.  He said he had been allowed out for short walks due to health issues, which include diabetes and high blood pressure.  Although the government's guidelines on quarantine hotels do allow for exercise at the discretion of security, some unions have previously expressed concern about the safety measures in place to protect staff working in the hotels and in particular those who may have to accompany guests on walks or cigarette breaks.  Bryan Simpson, hospitality organiser at the Unite union, said: ""It must not be ignored that workers are in as great a danger of transmitting the virus between each other as being exposed to it from quarantining passengers. ""Unite will be assisting our members on a hotel by hotel basis. If safety measures are insufficient Unite will demand immediate changes."" What is your experience of staying in a quarantine hotel?

Irish pupils given calculated grade or exam option,"Irish pupils preparing to leave secondary school will have the option of a calculated grade or a written exam. The proposal was approved by the Republic of Ireland's education minister on Wednesday. Irish broadcaster RTÃ reported that the option of calculated grades would be available in all subjects.  The calculated grade would also be issued at the same time as exam results. The Irish Leaving Cert exams are similar to A-Level qualifications taken in Northern Ireland whereby they are the final set of formal exams taken by pupils in schools. Earlier this month, Northern Ireland Education Minister Peter Weir confirmed schools would calculate GCSE, AS and A-Level grades to be awarded to their pupils in 2021. This ruled out the kind of statistical process used by CCEA which proved controversial in 2020. The Irish government hopes the proposal will be an incentive to get students to sit the written exam. Leaving Certificate exams were cancelled last year because of Covid-19. Non-exam assessments, including orals and practicals, will also go ahead, with some changes due to public health requirements.   Speaking to RTÃ's Six One, Irish Education Minister Norma Foley TD said that students now have ""clarity and choice"". She said the calculated grades will be overseen by the State Examination Commission. On orals and practicals, Ms Foley said it was ""very important"" that accommodations were made to allow them to happen.  She said the written exams would begin on 9 June 2021. On Wednesday, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin also said that the beginning of March is likely for the phased reopening of schools in the Republic, RTÃ reports.

More antidepressants prescribed but therapy down,"By Lucy Ballinger & Alex JenningsWales Live Antidepressants should not be used as a ""sticking plaster"", a charity has warned, after prescription numbers ""accelerated"" during the pandemic. While use of the drugs has increased, the number of people referred to talking therapies is down, official figures showed. Mind Cymru said antidepressants could be helpful for short periods but failed to address any long-term issues. The Welsh Government said it was investing in mental health support. More than 3.2 million antidepressant items were prescribed by GPs in Wales in the six months after the Covid pandemic started - an increase of 115,660 compared to the previous year. But in the same period the number of people referred for talking therapies fell by a third to 25,520, the figures showed. The number of antidepressants prescribed has been increasing during the last 20 years and GP prescribing data analysed by BBC's Wales Live showed that trend has continued. Father-of-two Luke Jones, 33, from Merthyr Tydfil, had previously been put on antidepressants after being diagnosed with clinical depression. When he started to struggle during the first lockdown he said his dosage was increased by the GP after a short phone call. The same thing happened when he called again in November. ""There was no trying to find out 'well why are you feeling like this?'. There was no thought to after-care either,"" Mr Jones, a student support worker, said. ""I think medication is just your foot in the door, really, or your first rung in the ladder to getting support. I would definitely have wanted to be offered talking therapies."" Aneurin Bevan University Health Board said it was ""sorry"" to hear of Mr Jones' experiences and a range of non-pharmacological interventions are available for patients. Sara Moseley, director of Mind Cymru, said: ""Antidepressants themselves can be helpful for short periods of time. ""But just prescribing antidepressants or only prescribing antidepressants is absolutely not the right thing to do. We know that there are so many other things that help and support people.  ""I think that very often antidepressants are used as a sticking plaster to alleviate distress in the short term but what they fail to do is to get to the bottom of sustainably, for the rest of that person's life, how do we deal with this person's issues?"" She said people were ""having to wait"" if they were referred and there were ""barriers"" to accessing talking therapies which were ""limited"". ""We'd like to see rapid access to advice, support and early intervention and talking therapies and we'd like to see that in communities the length and breadth of Wales,"" she said. In England, people can refer themselves through the NHS's Improving Access to Psychological Therapies service. But in Wales, services like counselling can only be accessed through the NHS with a referral from a GP.  Nearly 4,000 people have signed up to a six-week programme, Active Monitoring, launched by Mind Cymru last summer with Welsh Government funding. Through it, people worried about their mental health can self-refer for a weekly phone counselling session and access other resources, but funding is due to end in March and referrals close this week. Nursery assistant Gemma Crocker, 37, from Cardiff, signed up last year when she started having panic attacks. She was also prescribed antidepressants by her GP. She said: ""The minute I started talking to the counsellor there was these little waves of relief, little bits started to fall off and I started to understand what was actually going on."" ""I needed to be able to talk to someone who didn't know a lot about me and I needed the medication to bring me back - that's just the two. I could have tried one without the other but I don't know where I would have gone."" Dr Peter Saul, a GP in Wrexham and joint chair of the Royal College of GPs in Wales, said: ""We're seeing increasing numbers of patients with mental health issues as the pandemic itself has increased stresses and worries. ""The easy option is to give some medical treatment - an antidepressant or possibly something to help with anxiety. If we were in a more normal time we would be having a more balanced discussion with that patient to discuss what they wanted and what was available."" He called for a dedicated mental health worker for each GP practice in Wales to help balance talking therapies, self-help measures with anti-depressants.  A Welsh Government spokesman said mental health support had been essential during the pandemic and it was working closely with partners to respond to changing needs. ""We have also invested almost Â£10m to provide support for low level mental health issues and to prevent the need to access more specialist services,"" he said. ""Responding to the mental impact of the pandemic requires a multi-faceted and multi-agency approach and we are committed to work with partners to do this.""

Senedd member due in court over murder trial tweet,"A Plaid Cymru politician has been ordered to appear in court after she retweeted ""highly inappropriate"" comments about a murder trial. Helen Mary Jones MS shared a tweet from a domestic abuse campaigner expressing ""hope"" that a man would be found guilty of murdering his wife. The tweet was posted on Saturday and shared by Ms Jones the same day. It related to the trial of Anthony Williams, 70, who killed his wife during lockdown in March. The tweet was written by Rachel Williams, who was shot at her Newport hair salon by her estranged husband Darren Williams in 2011.  He was found hanged in a woodland hours after the attack, and six weeks later her 16-year-old son took his own life in the same area. Ms Williams went on to become a prominent anti-domestic violence campaigner and pioneer of the Ask for Ani [Action Needed Immediately] scheme, of which the Duchess of Cornwall is a patron. Her tweet included the comment: ""As so many of us will know, there would have been history of domestic abuse. I hope this jury finds him guilty of murder."" The issue can only now be reported after reporting restrictions were lifted on Wednesday. Both Ms Jones and Ms Williams have been ordered by Judge Paul Thomas to appear at Swansea Crown Court on Thursday. Ms Williams deleted the tweet on Monday, after being contacted by Gwent Police officers on the instruction of the judge. No evidence was heard during the trial that the defendant had a history of domestic abuse. In England and Wales, jurors are meant to deliver verdicts solely based on evidence heard in court, and told to ignore any information or commentary from external sources, including on social media. The Contempt of Court Act makes it an offence to publish anything which could prejudice or impede a trial. The tweet was posted after the jury in the murder trial had adjourned their deliberations for the weekend. On their return to court on Monday, Judge Thomas drew their attention to the social media commentary, saying: ""It's come to my attention that, over the weekend, there have been some highly inappropriate comments made on social media about this case. ""I should make it abundantly clear that those comments have not come from anybody connected with the case and, having been shown the contents of one such piece of social media, they clearly don't have any idea about the evidence in this case or the issues in this case."" The judge said domestic violence ""is a terrible scourge"", but added that a ""one-size-fits-all approach is highly inappropriate, particularly in this case"". Addressing both prosecution and defence, Judge Thomas said: ""This case will be before me on Thursday. Those involved will have to make themselves available on Thursday, and they should be told that forthwith."" No jury members said they had seen the Twitter posts, and resumed their deliberations before finding Williams not guilty of murder on Monday afternoon. He will be sentenced for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility on Thursday after previously admitting the charge. A spokesman for Plaid Cymru said ""it is not appropriate for the party to comment"" about Ms Jones' summons to court. Ms Williams confirmed she has also been asked by the judge to attend the court on Thursday, but declined to comment.

Surge testing identifies more Covid cases,"More than 50 Covid-19 cases have been found in south Manchester as surge testing continues. Testing has been planned after four cases of E484K, a mutation of the Kent strain, were discovered in Moss Side. The city council said people who tested positive for coronavirus had showed no symptoms.   A similar approach has been adopted in north Manchester after the mutation of the Kent variant was found in Moston and Harpurhey. The Local Democracy Reporting Service reports all of the people who tested positive in and around Moss Side showed no symptoms of having the virus. Almost 3,000 tests have been given to people living in the area, as well as the neighbouring Whalley Range, Hulme and Fallowfield, since 8 February.Â  Councillor Bev Craig, executive member for adult health and wellbeing at Manchester City Council, said: ""We've been able to identify over 50 cases of people without symptoms who have come back positive. ""We'll be able to share this for genomic testing so we can better understand across the country the implications of this strain."" Surge testing is the rollout of additional community testing of people who do not have any coronavirus symptoms. It aims to help scientists and public health officials learn more about mutated Covid-19 variants. It will also help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic cases and prompting people to self-isolate. Manchester's infection rates have fallen to 190 cases per 100,000 people - but it is still higher than the English average of 142 per 100,000. Covid-19 prevalence among the over-60s has also fallen to 170 cases per 100,000. More than 97,000 people in the city had received their first dose of the vaccine by 16 February. The council is working towards delivering 214,000 vaccines by mid-April. Councillor Craig said there are challenges to vaccination uptake which can differ ""in terms of geography"" but the council is working with those communities to ""make sure they have the information and confidence they need.""

Four more cases of South African variant in Wales,"Four more cases of the South African variant of Covid have been found in Wales, says Public Health Wales (PHW). It brings the total number of cases of the variant found in Wales to 17. Three of the new cases - found in west Wales - have been linked to international travel, while the fourth was linked to a previously identified case in Neath Port Talbot. PHW said there was no evidence of wider community transmission. It continues to investigate cases with no travel links. Scientists fear vaccines may be less effective against the South African variant of coronavirus, although there is no evidence it causes more severe illness. PHW had previously announced 13 cases of the variant, three of which had no links to travel to the region, sparking fears over community transmission. But the public health agency said one of these three cases, found in Anglesey, had now been linked back to international travel, while it had not found evidence of further transmission of another case in Conwy. The third of these early South African variant cases, found in Neath Port Talbot, has been linked to one of the new cases announced on Wednesday. Dr Giri Shankar, Covid-19 incident director for Public Health Wales, said: ""The identification of these cases demonstrates that well-established processes under the Test, Trace, Protect strategy are proving to be effective. ""Public Health Wales is working in close partnership with the Welsh Government, local health boards and local authorities to find out where the virus was acquired, and if any onward transmission has occurred. ""This is a small number of cases and there is no evidence at the moment that sustained community transmission has occurred.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56104046,1
Carers and vulnerable to receive vaccine jabs,"Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccination programme has been extended to include carers and more people with underlying health conditions. The vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres. Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said.  On Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015. People aged 18 to 64 with underlying health conditions - as well as their carers - will now be contacted by GPs for their jab.  This extended target group largely mirrors those who receive the winter flu vaccine each year because of their medical conditions.   Carers aged 60-64, anyone aged 65-69 and those who received a shielding letter because they are Clinically Extremely Vulnerable (CEV) will now be able to receive the vaccine at a regional vaccination centre.  In addition, anyone over 70 who has not yet had their first dose from their GP will have the option to book a vaccination appointment at one of the seven regional centres. The timing of vaccination jabs for people with asthma depends on the severity of their condition, and is based on an assessment from their GP, said the health department.  Health Minister Robin Swann encouraged anyone eligible for vaccinations to book as soon as possible. ""It had been planned to begin vaccinating carers in early March,"" he said.  ""I am delighted that we are now able to bring this forward, on a staggered basis.  ""As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,"" added Mr Swann. There are currently 434 Covid inpatients in Northern Ireland's hospitals, with 53 being treated in intensive care, 44 of whom are on ventilators. The Department of Health said there were currently 53 active outbreaks in care homes. In Wednesday's figures, the largest increase in cases came in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon area, where 75 extra cases of Covid-19 were reported in the last 24 hours.  The council area has also seen the biggest increase in new cases of the virus reported over the last seven days.  The Republic of Ireland reported 650 new cases on Wednesday, and 57 Covid-19 related deaths, bringing the country's death toll to 4,036.  So far, more than 2,800 people in Northern Ireland who are clinically housebound have received their first Covid-19 jab. Clinically housebound patients have been receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The department began vaccinating that cohort of patients on 6 February. While just under 16,000 people are registered to receive the flu vaccine at home according to the Department of Health, a number of housebound people have been receiving their Covid jab at their GP practice as well. #Covid19 vaccination programme extendedRead more â¡ï¸ https://t.co/Rm42FxqS72 pic.twitter.com/hbmljLUq4J The Northern Ireland Executive is due to meet on Thursday to review the ongoing coronavirus restrictions.

Ian Rankin's son 'forgotten' by vaccine programme,"Scottish crime author Ian Rankin says his son Kit has been ""forgotten"" as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. Rankin told the BBC he believes those in Kit's circumstance ""should have been prioritised"". The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. Itâs #InternationalAngelmanDay so hereâs a photo of me with son Kit at Christmas - the one day weâve had him home in a very anxious year. pic.twitter.com/hGKv0ekV8z People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disability are in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine.  This means Kit will receive his vaccine after his father. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Rankin said people who have family members with special needs feel ""let down"" by the programme. He said: ""Our son has severe learning difficulties, he has suffered epilepsy in the past, he can't look after himself in any way, shape or form, and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 60 to 65-year-olds. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" A previous BBC investigation heard that not enough consideration was given to disabled people and their complex needs when lockdown came into effect - and this had a continued impact over the summer. Rankin said he had not spoken to an MP or MSP about his family's circumstance, believing they would ""just pass the buck"". While he has sympathy for the government dealing with the pandemic, he said more could have been done earlier to ensure people who are learning disabled were not as badly affected. ""The families and the carers have been kept out the loop,"" he said.  ""Life's hard enough for them. This year has been tough without any of the usual services, treatment, education they usually get.  ""The idea they're just being forgotten about sitting in isolating in their care homes.  ""Both governments keep telling us it's wonderful they've got all the care homes done. No, you haven't. You've got care homes for the elderly done. There's more care homes than that out there."" Rankin also shared his frustration over how his son's residence was classified as a care home during lockdown but not for the vaccine programme. ""The disabled don't have a voice,"" he added. ""They've never had a voice and laterally we're starting to hear their representatives, their family and friends, yelling"". The Scottish government said evidence suggested risk of serious Covid-19 was associated with age and that mortality is low in those aged under 40, ""even for individuals with clinical risk factors"".  A spokesman said: ""We have rightly focused first on the people who are the most vulnerable losing their life, to stand the chance of saving as many lives of possible with the vaccine, in line with JCVI priorities.  ""We have now given first doses to more than a million people, including elderly care home residents and staff, frontline health and social care workers and those who are at risk of serious harm and death from this virus.""

Zanzibar vice-president dies after getting Covid,"The vice-president of Tanzania's semi-autonomous islands of Zanzibar has died, nearly three weeks after his party said he had contracted Covid-19. No official reason has been given for the death of Seif Sharif Hamad, popularly known as Maalim Seif, at the age of 77. He was the most prominent politician in Tanzania to have openly declared that he had the virus. Health experts have accused the authorities in Tanzania of downplaying the threat posed by Covid-19.   Tanzanian President John Magufuli has called for prayers and herbal remedies to counter it.   Mr Hamad was a senior member of the opposition ACT Wazalendo party, which has been critical of the government's policy on Covid.  The BBC's Aboubakar Famau looks back at Mr Hamad's life. Thousands of supporters of Mr Hamad would flock to political rallies in Zanzibar just to catch a glimpse of him.  His eloquence, charisma and obvious power while on the political stage made him a force to be reckoned with. This former teacher - hence his name, Maalim, meaning ""teacher"" in Swahili - would attract both men and women, young and old,  rich and poor, to his rallies. They would all be clad in party regalia, chanting political slogans. ""We are where you are,"" they would shout in a demonstration of their unwavering loyalty and dedication.  But they regarded him as more than a politician. They saw him as a fatherly figure who relentlessly fought for their rights.  And they were loyal to him rather than to his party, which was evident last year when Mr Hamad decided to leave the Civic United Front (Cuf), in which he had served as general secretary since its formation in 1992. His departure was over an internal wrangle and thousands of his supporters followed him to the ACT-Wazalendo party.  He started his political life as a member of the governing Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) party, but was expelled in 1988 after falling out with the leadership. While with CCM, he served as Zanzibar's chief minister between 1984 and 1988. The position was later renamed vice-president.   In opposition he ran unsuccessfully for president of Zanzibar six times.  Some of the polls were marred by irregularities and gross human rights abuses.  The worst post-poll violence was in January 2001 where more than a dozen of his supporters were shot dead in the island of Pemba as they were protesting against results of the 2000 election.   Nevertheless, it was obvious that time was running out as illness and age were both taking their toll on Mr Hamad. Unlike in other general elections, in the 2020 campaign he was visibly frail, asking for physical support from his bodyguards as he climbed on stage.  He was detained several times, most recently in October on the eve of the general election. He was later released. In the wake of this defeat in the election, in a reconciliatory move by Zanzibar's President Hussein Mwinyi, he was appointed as first vice-president for a second term.  He may never have achieved his dream of winning the top job, but joining President Mwinyi's unity government would have probably been some consolation to him.

Charles says country owes NHS 'debt of gratitude',"The Prince of Wales has told NHS staff the country owes them ""an enormous debt of gratitude"" for their efforts in the coronavirus pandemic. He unveiled a plaque to say thank you to workers on a visit to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham with the Duchess of Cornwall. The hospital trust is thought to have treated the most Covid-positive patients of any NHS trust in the UK. Prince Charles added: ""We are very lucky indeed to have you."" ""There are masses of people who are unsung and unseen heroes and heroines but we owe them such an enormous debt of gratitude and so many of you particularly.  ""The pressures are huge,"" he said. The University Hospitals Birmingham Trust also runs Good Hope, Heartlands and Solihull hospitals in the West Midlands. It is thought to have treated 12,500 Covid-positive patients, with 10,000 of those being discharged. Nathan Samuels, a consultant nurse at the hospital, said Prince Charles spoke to him on the visit about his admiration for their efforts. ""He showed a great deal of empathy, which was really refreshing and he seemed very genuine,"" he said. The royals, who got their first vaccine dose last week, also met, at a distance, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, in their first joint official public event for two months. Mr Hancock told staff in the vaccine programme: ""From the bottom of my heart, from everybody across Birmingham, across the country, we are really grateful and it is so wonderful, the spirit that there is in this programme.""  The hospital trust has also recruited 1,000 patients for the vaccine trials. They started a trial in February to see if giving people different Covid vaccines for their first and second doses works as well as the current approach of using the same type of vaccine twice. Consultant Christopher Green, principal investigator for the trial, said he hoped their work would help people in their choice over having the jab. ""As we go through the trials, as we accumulate reliable data, hopefully that will help people come to a decision about whether to accept a vaccine in the future,"" he said.

Muslim minicab drivers forced to pray in bus stop,"Muslim minicab drivers working at Heathrow Airport have described feeling ""humiliated"" after being forced to pray in a bus stop car park.  Drivers said they have prayed on the kerb of the road due to a lack of facilities for more than a year, but conditions have worsened recently.  The App Drivers and Couriers Union (ADCU) said workers were put in danger by the airport's services. Heathrow Airport said it remains ""committed"" to improving services.  It added it would reopen prayer rooms in the terminal when it was ""safe to do so"". There are two car parks outside Heathrow Airport, one is designated for black cab taxi drivers, while the other on North Perimeter Road is for minicab and private hire drivers.   The ADCU said there was an increase in drivers waiting in the minicab car park area due to fewer passengers travelling during the pandemic.  Private hire driver Zamir Dreni, who uses the bus stop to pray, said the facilities are ""inhumane and degrading"". ""Recently, conditions have deteriorated to the point that I believe they are dangerous,"" he said. ""I feel that the airport authorities treat us with complete contempt.  ""We have tried to talking them, we even prepared a petition, but they have refused to listen to us or to take responsibility for the problems here,"" the 40-year-old said.  Mr Dreni added he pays about Â£20 per day to the airport in parking charges.  The ADCU said drivers also reported no hot water and soap in the toilet facilities in recent weeks.  The union's general secretary, James Farrar, said workers felt ""upset, humiliated and angry"" after conditions came to a ""disgusting crescendo"". ""People are praying in close proximity to moving traffic, it becomes a real risk for them.  ""If you are a devout Muslim, you must pray and too often it is inside that car park. What can we do? The union added it was calling for ""safe, sanitary and dignified working conditions"". A Heathrow Airport spokeswoman said it was not able to provide facilities in the car park due to ""health and safety concerns"". ""The airport's cleaning contractors regularly inspect and clean the facilities during peak periods, but we also expect the drivers using the site to keep the facilities in good condition,"" they said.

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  The prime minister has stressed England will ease its coronavirus restrictions ""cautiously"" and it is ""absolutely right"" to take a ""data not dates"" approach to leaving lockdown. Boris Johnson's comments come just days before he is expected to set out a road map on Monday for easing measures. He said relaxation of measures would be done in ""stages"" and that the reopening of hospitality was one of the last things to return after the first lockdown. Speaking at a mass vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to be ""going one way from now on, based on the incredible vaccination rollout"". Healthy, young volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first Covid-19 ""human challenge"" study. The study, which will take place in the UK and has received ethics approval, will start in the next few weeks and recruit 90 people aged 18-30. They will be exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment while medics monitor their health. The trials will help scientists work out the smallest amount of coronavirus needed to cause infection, and how the body's immune system reacts to it. This will give doctors a better understanding of Covid-19, which will feed into the development of vaccines and treatments. Fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the existing three symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers have suggested. Currently, government guidance states anyone with a cough, fever or loss of smell or taste qualifies. Testing for the additional four symptoms could pick up 40% more cases, according to King's College London and the Zoe Symptom Study app. The government said an expert scientific group keeps the virus symptoms under review and ""the main symptoms have been carefully selected to capture those most likely to have Covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who do not"". The charity Pregnant Then Screwed has lost its legal challenge against the government for indirect sexual discrimination over the amount of support self-employed mothers received. The group said women who had maternity leave got less money from a fund set up to help those hit by the Covid pandemic and lockdown restrictions. But a judge ruled the chancellor had properly considered the women's situation. Pregnant Then Screwed said the judgment was ""fundamentally flawed"" and was considering its options for appeal. More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries on his way to help campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown rules. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). His colleagues have described the fundraising efforts as ""phenomenal"". ""What's really struck me is the number of people who have donated. The fact more than 20,000 have contributed is remarkable,"" said Mike Blakey, a fellow volunteer with the team. The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester, have both been fined Â£200.

PM to focus on 'data not dates' in lockdown easing,"Boris Johnson says it is ""absolutely right"" to take a ""data not dates"" approach to leaving lockdown, stressing England will ease measures ""cautiously"". The prime minister said he would set out ""what we can"" in a road map for easing restrictions on Monday.  ""We want to be going one way from now on, based on the incredible vaccination rollout,"" he said. It follows a call from scientists for a data-led approach to lifting measures.  Speaking at a mass vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales, Mr Johnson said relaxation of measures would be done in ""stages"" and that the reopening of hospitality was one of the last things to return after the first lockdown. ""You have to remember from last year that we opened up hospitality fully as one of the last things that we did because there is obviously an extra risk of transmission from hospitality,"" he said. Asked whether he agreed with a data-led approach, Mr Johnson said ""I do think that's absolutely right"" and said the relaxation of measures will be ""based firmly on a cautious and prudent approach"", in such a way as to be ""irreversible"". Official figures show the UK has recorded a further 12,718 Covid cases and another 738 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Last Wednesday, 13,013 cases and 1,001 deaths were reported. A total of 15,940,972 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine. At the weekend ministers were hopeful that schools could reopen from 8 March, with non-essential shops to follow and later pubs and restaurants. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said he expected ""gradual easing"" to be the approach from when restrictions were reviewed but the government needed to ""do more to stop the spread"". ""We have to be driven by the data, but we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,"" he said. Prof Dame Angela McLean, deputy chief scientific adviser, earlier told the Commons Science and Technology Committee that each step of easing measures should be ""irrevocable"", adding ""that means we have to be extremely careful, before we add another unlocking"". ""We want to understand the impact on each step before taking the next steps,"" she said, adding that required a ""large gap"" after children go back to school. Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious diseases from Edinburgh University who advises the government, said it was right to be cautious. But he said it must also be recognised the falling rates of infection seen during lockdown were more encouraging than many thought they would be. He said schools were not a ""significant driver of infection"" and there had never been a surge in cases seen across western Europe after reopening schools - although the new UK variant, which is more contagious, needed to be considered. On Tuesday, Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the phased return of primary school pupils from Monday, while in Wales pupils aged three to seven will return to school after half-term. They remain closed to most pupils in Northern Ireland. Infection rates are coming down - more quickly than many thought they would given the new more contagious UK variant. The vaccination programme is also going well, providing protection to the most vulnerable. And the arrival of spring should be expected to help keep rates low. So why the caution? While most believe Covid will become seasonal, a bounce-back in the summer is not being ruled out.  And even if rates rebound only a little, there are still large numbers of vulnerable people. Nearly half of hospitalisations have been in the under-70s. What is more, high levels of infection at a time when vaccines are being rolled out and immunity being built provides the perfect breeding ground for new variants. Mutation may be unavoidable in the long-term, but encouraging them at this point would, many experts believe, be foolish. It means the government is likely to be more cautious than some would want - and indeed maybe need to be given the cost of lockdown. But the judgement being made is it's better to go slowly and surely rather than having to take any more steps back. Also speaking at the committee earlier was Prof Sir John Bell, Oxford University's regius professor of medicine, who said it was ""not plausible"" to expect people to comply with major curbs after they have received two doses of vaccine. ""It's better to plan for that than to assume you can hold back the water with a dam, because you won't be able to,"" he said. The committee heard that ministers may need to consider what society sees is an ""acceptable"" level of Covid infection and deaths as restrictions are eased. Asked about this on BBC Radio 4's World At One programme, Prof Peter Openshaw, from the government respiratory virus threats advisory group Nervtag, said some ""hard-nosed... calculations are going to be done"". NHS Providers, which represents health managers, has suggested the number of new daily cases should be below 1,000 before restrictions are lifted. The average is currently above 10,000. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said the end of April, once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated, was the ""logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions"". Meanwhile, healthy volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first ""human challenge"" study which will take place in the UK.

What can you learn from giving volunteers coronavirus?,"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent A group of volunteers in the UK are going to be deliberately infected with coronavirus in what's known as a ""challenge trial"". It will be the first such trial in Covid anywhere in the world. The study has been given ethical approval and is expected to start soon, with around 90 people being infected.   The volunteers come into hospital and will spend the whole time in a single room, and come into contact only with people running the trial. On the third day, a small syringe filled with live virus will be squirted up their nose.  They will be monitored in hospital - including regular blood samples - for at least the next two weeks, after which they can go home if they are free of the virus.  The volunteers will continue to be followed up for a year. Initially the challenge trials will be focused on crucial scientific questions that are almost impossible to answer in the real world. This will give us a better understanding of coronavirus.  The attention will eventually turn to vaccines too, but this could still be months away. People would be given a Covid vaccine and then, after immunity has built up, they would have the virus squirted up their nose.  This will help assess the effectiveness of the next generation of Covid vaccines, and the same techniques can also be used to test-research new drugs or to develop tests for Covid. Both play an important role, but there are some advantages to challenge trials.  The main one is they get results - including on vaccine effectiveness - incredibly quickly.  This is because everyone is deliberately infected, whereas a ""real world"" trial would have to wait for people to catch the virus in their day-to-day lives.  At the moment, the challenge trials are using the form of the virus that was circulating in the summer of 2020. It will take three to four months to switch the trials to one of the newer variants that have since emerged.  But in the future, this will be an important way of assessing whether vaccines work against the new variants. The risk is low, but a challenge trial is not completely risk-free. The trial is focusing on young people (aged 18-30) with no health problems, who we know are very unlikely to have any health problems from a coronavirus infection, and they will be closely monitored in hospital. They are not ""paid"" but they are ""compensated"" for the time commitment. People are given about Â£4,500 across the whole of the year-long study. Yes. The idea is not new and research on vaccines for malaria, cholera and flu have all been aided by challenge trials.  Doing challenge trials for Covid was raised right at the start of the pandemic. However, it would not have been ethical to go ahead back then, when we had so little information about what coronavirus did to the body.

"Devolution not an overall disaster, says PM","Devolution has not been an ""overall"" disaster, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking on visit to a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, Torfaen, he said ""it depends"" what the devolved authorities do. Since 1999, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have had more control over their own affairs. The comments come amid debate within the Conservative Party itself about the future of devolution and the union itself. A group of Conservatives were recently selected to stand for the Welsh Parliament after telling members they would support abolishing the institution. Plaid Cymru Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Johnson's defence of devolution was ""lukewarm"". Mr Johnson's visit also took him to South Wales Police's headquarters in Bridgend, although a Senedd minister questioned whether he should have travelled to Wales given the current lockdown rules. Asked if he thought devolution had been a disaster, Mr Johnson said: ""Certainly not overall, absolutely not overall."" He said he had been a ""proud beneficiary"" of devolution when he was mayor of London. ""I think that devolution can work very well, but it depends very much on what the devolved authorities do,"" he added. Also while on the visit, Mr Johnson said the UK and Welsh governments were working to ""concert"" their messages on lockdown.  In Wales, the National Assembly was set up following a referendum in 1997. Its powers grew and, after a further referendum in 2011, it gained law-making powers and has since changed its name to the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru. Elections to the Senedd determine what ministers form the Welsh Government, which is a separate body currently led by First Minister Mark Drakeford. Mr Drakeford has been in charge of Covid-19 restrictions in Wales and has been free to vary the rules from the UK government. The two governments chose to go into lockdown at different times during the winter months and have, at times, disagreed on the messaging to the public. The whole of the UK is now under lockdown, however. Mr Johnson said UK ministers were having ""continuous conversations"" with Mr Drakeford and the two sides tried ""to make sure we concert our approach and concert our general messaging"". ""Overall, if you look at infection rates across the UK, they are coming down a bit now, that's very encouraging.""Mr Johnson added that while there were ""some encouraging signs"" this could be driven by vaccination and it was ""still early days"". The prime minister said a ""data not dates"" approach would be ""absolute right"" in exiting restrictions in England. Mark Drakeford recently partly blamed the UK government's programme of austerity as being behind high rates of coronavirus deaths in parts of the south Wales valleys. Mr Johnson said he would be ""reluctant to ascribe a single cause like that"". ""Yes, sadly, some parts of the UK have been worse hit than than others,"" he said. ""I think that there will be a time where we go over everything and when the pandemic has really come to an end then we try to isolate all the particular causes, but I think it is multifactorial."" The UK government was recently warned to avoid ""complacency"" over the Welsh independence movement. Mr Johnson told journalists that he was ""confident"" about the future of the union, although he said he wasn't complacent. ""I believe passionately in the Union. And I think that its, its advantages are clear.""

She told a press conference: ""Of course he is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and has to make his own judgement on that.

Tourism industry's shock at Easter break warning,"Tourism businesses say they have been left reeling after a warning from the first minister that it was ""highly unlikely"" holiday accommodation would reopen for the Easter holidays. Nicola Sturgeon has advised people against booking a break in Scotland or overseas at the start of April. In her Covid update statement to MSPs at Holyrood on Tuesday, she said it was ""hard to overstate the necessity of being careful, cautious and gradual as we exit this lockdown"". Ms Sturgeon said this meant continuing to abide by ""stay-at-home"" rules.  She said the possibility of summer holidays would depend on infection rates and the risks posed by new variants of the virus. The Scottish government hopes to publish a ""revised strategic framework"" next week which will set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased. Willie Cameron, of Loch Ness Marketing, said local tourism businesses had ""more or less"" accepted there would be no overseas visitors this Easter. But he said they had been ""cautiously"" organising bookings from within Scotland, and first minister's statement had come as a shock. Mr Cameron said: ""Our businesses were getting all prepared for some form of localised home-stay holidays. ""I fully sympathise with, and I realise the government has got to be cautious, but to say don't book, well that is it. It's (Easter holidays) scrapped.  ""It has completely taken the guillotine down on it."" Mr Cameron said there was also uncertainty now over short breaks in May - the next opportunity for tourism before the summer holidays. He said he hoped the Scottish government's revised strategic framework would provide the industry with some optimism. Nicola Sturgeon has urged people in Scotland to not book Easter holidays as it is ""highly unlikely"" that hotels or self-catering accommodation will be open by then.Read more â¡ï¸ https://t.co/tRoXUEKqZG pic.twitter.com/UUT4yC3IWv Anne MacDonald, co-owner of The Spey B&B in Grantown on Spey in the Cairngorms, said her business had bookings for April and May - many of them carried over from last year when the start of the pandemic shut down the tourism industry. Mrs MacDonald said the biggest shock from the first minister's statement was that there was no guarantee of staycations even in the summer. Last summer, following a relaxation of restrictions in July, some parts of the Highlands saw a return of some tourism. Mrs MacDonald said: ""2020 was a bad enough season as it was. 2021 is just going to be terrible. ""We had hoped it was going to be better. We added a self-catering apartment because so many people were self-catering last year and we thought it would supplement our business."" Tamasina Cassidy, who runs the Rowan Tree Hotel and Restaurant in Aviemore, said she also had bookings for Easter. She said: ""We are really disappointed. We were hoping to be open for 1 April."" But she added: ""If it means a relatively restriction-free summer and we can trade as we did last summer that would be amazing."" Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance, said many businesses were ""extremely anxious"". He said: ""I know of numerous businesses who are wholly reliant on being able to trade again at Easter in order to stay solvent; today's indication that this is highly unlikely will I know serve as a crushing blow to many."" Mr Crothall said businesses appreciated the need to supress Covid-19. He said: ""Scotland's tourism industry continues to be 100% aligned to the health agenda. ""Our businesses are committed to opening in a safe and secure way, giving customers confidence as a result of the level of financial investment which has been adopted across the sector."" Ms Sturgeon told MSPs on Tuesday: ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels or self-catering accommodation by then.

"Devolution not an overall disaster, says PM","Devolution has not been an ""overall"" disaster, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking on visit to a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, Torfaen, he said ""it depends"" what the devolved authorities do. Since 1999, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have had more control over their own affairs. The comments come amid debate within the Conservative Party itself about the future of devolution and the union itself. A group of Conservatives were recently selected to stand for the Welsh Parliament after telling members they would support abolishing the institution. Plaid Cymru Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Johnson's defence of devolution was ""lukewarm"". Mr Johnson's visit also took him to South Wales Police's headquarters in Bridgend, although a Senedd minister questioned whether he should have travelled to Wales given the current lockdown rules. Asked if he thought devolution had been a disaster, Mr Johnson said: ""Certainly not overall, absolutely not overall."" He said he had been a ""proud beneficiary"" of devolution when he was mayor of London. ""I think that devolution can work very well, but it depends very much on what the devolved authorities do,"" he added. Also while on the visit, Mr Johnson said the UK and Welsh governments were working to ""concert"" their messages on lockdown.  In Wales, the National Assembly was set up following a referendum in 1997. Its powers grew and, after a further referendum in 2011, it gained law-making powers and has since changed its name to the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru. Elections to the Senedd determine what ministers form the Welsh Government, which is a separate body currently led by First Minister Mark Drakeford. Mr Drakeford has been in charge of Covid-19 restrictions in Wales and has been free to vary the rules from the UK government. The two governments chose to go into lockdown at different times during the winter months and have, at times, disagreed on the messaging to the public. The whole of the UK is now under lockdown, however. Mr Johnson said UK ministers were having ""continuous conversations"" with Mr Drakeford and the two sides tried ""to make sure we concert our approach and concert our general messaging"". ""Overall, if you look at infection rates across the UK, they are coming down a bit now, that's very encouraging.""Mr Johnson added that while there were ""some encouraging signs"" this could be driven by vaccination and it was ""still early days"". The prime minister said a ""data not dates"" approach would be ""absolute right"" in exiting restrictions in England. Mark Drakeford recently partly blamed the UK government's programme of austerity as being behind high rates of coronavirus deaths in parts of the south Wales valleys. Mr Johnson said he would be ""reluctant to ascribe a single cause like that"". ""Yes, sadly, some parts of the UK have been worse hit than than others,"" he said. ""I think that there will be a time where we go over everything and when the pandemic has really come to an end then we try to isolate all the particular causes, but I think it is multifactorial."" The UK government was recently warned to avoid ""complacency"" over the Welsh independence movement. Mr Johnson told journalists that he was ""confident"" about the future of the union, although he said he wasn't complacent. ""I believe passionately in the Union. And I think that its, its advantages are clear."" ""When you see vaccination being rolled out by the NHS invented in the UK, it's impossible not to be very moved and also very confident about the future of our of our country."" Welsh Government Wellbeing Minister Eluned Morgan said she was not sure Mr Johnson's visit could be classed as essential travel.

What does surge testing mean for IP22?,"Surge testing - or mass testing - for the South African variant of Covid-19 is being expanded in several areas across England, including the IP22 postcode in Norfolk. What does this mean to the area? The IP22 postcode straddles part of the Norfolk/Suffolk border, and a ""very small number of cases"" of the South African variant have been found there, according to public health officials at Norfolk County Council, although they would not provide a precise figure. The surge testing will only target Diss and Roydon. Diss is a small market town about 20 miles south of Norwich, while the village of Roydon lies about a mile west. Together they have a population of about 11,200 residents.  A council spokesman says it is ""government policy to bring in surge testing for any cases that can't be linked explicitly to foreign travel, regardless of how small the number is"". He adds that all those who tested positive are self-isolating.  Further lockdown restrictions are not being proposed for the area.  Dr Louise Smith, Norfolk's director of public health, says they have been working with the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and Public Health England ""on tracing cases of this variant, and have agreed a programme of local testing"". ""Thanks to our close working with the Quadram Institute in Norwich, we've been able to detect the variant originating in South Africa here in Norfolk,"" she said. Door-to-door testing of adults will be carried out from Friday. John Fuller, leader of South Norfolk District Council, said: ""Last year our residents worked together to turn the tide of rising numbers in Wymondham.  ""Now we need to pull together again and I am asking every resident in Diss and Roydon to help us by taking a test."" A county council spokesman said: ""Every person living in Diss and Roydon over the age of 16 is strongly encouraged to take a PCR Covid-19 test this week, even if they are not showing symptoms."" Tests can be booked with mobile units which will be deployed at: Households will receive a letter in the next few days telling them how they will be tested.  People can book tests via the government's testing website. Vulnerable people can request to have a test delivered and collected from their home. Working with the Department of Health we will be testing all adults in Diss and Roydon from Friday. This is a precaution to find South African variant virus. Overall numbers in area are going down. No need for people to worry.https://t.co/7tpD8IEbOM Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, says the testers will collect as many swab samples as possible from local people. ""The idea is to see how widespread the South African variant is within the local communities, and try and work out where that person they know about got their infection, and make sure the currently-infected person hasn't spread that to their neighbours and friends,"" he says. The South African variant of coronavirus carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread.  On 1 February, an urgent programme began offering about 80,000 people across England a test for the variant.  It is hoped the roll-out of additional community testing will help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic people who will then self-isolate. When outlining the surge testing programme, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was no evidence the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. But there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. The DHSC said positive cases will be sequenced for genomic data to help scientists and public health officials improve their understanding the South African variant and its spread. ""Further data on surge testing will be provided in due course,"" a department spokesman said. According to the latest government figures, in 11 people in the Diss and Roydon area tested positive for all variants of Covid-19 in the seven days to 11 February - a decrease of two on the figure for the seven days to 4 February. In the wider South Norfolk district, the Covid-19 rate had gone down from 176 cases per 100,000 people in the week to 5 February, to 101 cases per 100,000 in the week to 12 February. Since the start of the pandemic until 5 February, there had been 200 deaths of people in South Norfolk within 28 days of having a positive Covid-19 test, according to the government.

New York sues Amazon over 'deficient' Covid response,"New York's top prosecutor has accused Amazon of falling short of health and safety laws in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a lawsuit, Attorney General Letitia James said Amazon had displayed a ""flagrant disregard"" for the rules and illegally retaliated against workers who raised concerns. Amazon last week attempted to block the lawsuit with its own legal action.  It said Ms James was applying ""an inconsistent and unfair"" standard. ""We care deeply about the health and safety of our employees, as demonstrated in our filing last week, and we don't believe the Attorney General's filing presents an accurate picture of Amazon's industry-leading response to the pandemic,"" spokeswoman Kelly Nantel said in a statement. Amazon faced criticism from workers around the world last year over its response to the coronavirus pandemic. In France and Spain, officials forced the firm to make changes after unions filed complaints.  Ms James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York City found Amazon implemented a ""deficient"" programme to trace the contacts of infected workers and did not follow rules requiring companies to shut and disinfect areas that had been visited by a sick person, among other violations. She said the firm ""cut corners"" when it came to steps that would have hurt its sales volume - and profit. ""Amazon's flagrant disregard for health and safety requirements has threatened serious illness and grave harm to the thousands of workers in these facilities and poses a continued substantial and specific danger to the public health,"" she said in the filing. Ms James launched her investigation last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers n New York, then the epicentre of America's coronavirus outbreak. The probe later expanded to include concerns about retaliation after Amazon fired some of the workers, including Christian Smalls, who spoke out about the issues. ""While Amazon and its CEO made billions during this crisis, hardworking employees were forced to endure unsafe conditions and were retaliated against for rightfully voicing these concerns,"" she said.  ""Since the pandemic began, it is clear that Amazon has valued profit over people and has failed to ensure the health and safety of its workers."" In its complaint last week, Amazon said Ms James lacked oversight over the workplace issues, which it said are governed by national labour laws. It also accused her of ignoring the steps the company has taken to protect its workers, pointing to a 30 March city inspection inspection of its warehouse in Staten Island, New York, which concluded that ""there were absolutely no areas of concern"". The rate of infection among Amazon staff in New York is half that of the area's general population, it added. Amazon said that it fired Mr Smalls for violating requests that he quarantine after being exposed to the virus.

Covid deaths falling as vaccine 'having an effect',"The vaccination campaign is starting to reduce the Covid death toll in Scotland, the country's first minister has said.  Nicola Sturgeon said that there was now ""hard evidence"" that the vaccinations were having a positive impact.  The number of deaths has fallen for three consecutive weeks, with deaths in care homes reducing by 62% in that time.  Deaths at home have fallen by 29% and in hospitals by 11%.  Older residents in care homes were treated as the top priority when the vaccination programme rollout began.  The first minister told MSPs that with the exception of one week in August - when only two deaths were registered - care homes accounted for a smaller proportion of overall Covid deaths last week than at any time since March last year.  Ms Sturgeon went on to say that a breakdown of deaths by age showed a 45% drop over the past three weeks among the over-85 age group, according to National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures.  People aged over 80 living in the community had been the next priority of the vaccination programme, after care home residents. The first minister said the latest NRS report contained the ""first hard evidence of the positive impact of vaccination"". She added: ""It is reasonable to take some heart from this because it strongly suggests the vaccine programme is having the hoped for effect of reducing the death toll from the virus."" Ms Sturgeon was speaking at first minister's questions, which saw heated exchanges with opposition leaders over an Audit Scotland report that found the Scottish government had not been adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic. The watchdog found that not all of the actions identified during pandemic planning exercises between 2015 and 2018 had been implemented.  These included measures to ensure access to enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and to quickly address social care capacity. Opposition parties said the failure to heed warnings and prepare better had cost lives, and claimed that either ""negligence or incompetence"" was to blame. Ms Sturgeon said there were ""lots of lessons to learn"" from the report, but insisted that ""the steps we have taken are the right ones"". It comes as the latest NRS statistics showed that more than 80% of deaths over the most recent week occurred in hospital (266), while 42 were in care homes and 15 at home or in non-institutional settings. The figures also showed that in the most recent week, February 8 to 14, deaths of those aged 85 and over were lower than those aged 75 to 84 for the first time since November. The deaths of a further 64 people who had tested positive for the virus in the previous 28 days were recorded on Tuesday - bringing the total by that measure to 6,828 A further 1,121 cases of Covid were identified through testing in the last 24 hours, and the daily test positivity rate was 5.2% - down from 6% the previous day.  There were 1,317 people in hospital confirmed to have the virus, down 66 from the previous day, and 99 patients were in intensive care - a reduction of one.  A further 32,070 people were given their first dose of the vaccine on Tuesday - about half of the number from the same day last week - bringing the total to 1,320,074. The Scottish government had previously warned that the vaccination programme would slow down in the middle of this month because of supply problems with the Pfizer vaccine.  After complaints from opposition politicians that the Scottish programme was lagging behind the other UK nations, it had been speeding up the number of first doses over the past fortnight. But the country has given a second dose of the vaccine to a much lower percentage of its population a  than England has.

"Ministers not fully ready for Covid, says watchdog","The Scottish government was not adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report by the public spending watchdog. An Audit Scotland report said ministers had been planning for a pandemic - but had based their preparations on flu. The watchdog also found the government acted quickly to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed by coronavirus.  Opposition leaders said the failure to heed warnings and prepare better had cost the lives of care home residents. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon there were ""lots of lessons to learn"" from the report, but insisted that ""the steps we have taken are the right ones"". The watchdog found that despite a number of pandemic planning exercises - in 2015, 2016 and 2018 - not all the actions identified in these projects were fully implemented.  These included measures to ensure access to enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and to quickly address social care capacity. The report said the government had been ""slow"" to implement suggested changes in areas that would later become a ""significant challenge"" during the pandemic. It stated that ministers ""could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic"" and said lessons must be learned. However, auditors also found that actions such as cancelling non-urgent operations and increasing intensive care capacity had stopped the NHS from being overwhelmed in the first wave of Covid.  There were heated exchanges about the report during Ms Sturgeon's weekly question session at Holyrood, where she defended her government's response. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said Audit Scotland had set out ""in black and white"" that the government was ""less prepared that it should have been"". She said: ""Mistakes were made by this government, mistakes that cost the health of frontline workers, mistakes that cost the lives of care home residents, mistakes that built up over a decade of delay. ""The report makes it plain that her government was warned again and again, there were years where this first minister could have acted."" Ms Sturgeon said ""a range of national and local pandemic guidance and plans"" had been updated in light of the planning exercise - but stressed that they had focused on a flu pandemic rather than the ""different beast"" of Covid-19. She said: ""However well prepared we were for flu, it became clear quite quickly that we were dealing with something of a completely different nature. ""If I reflect back on the last 10 months I actually think the more valid criticism of the Scottish government and other governments across the Western world is that in the early stages we maybe relied a bit too much on flu preparations, and perhaps hadn't done enough to prepare for the experiences of SARS-type outbreaks."" The first minister also said had ""sought to do nothing over the past 10 months other than every single day to do my best and make sure the government was doing its best to steer this country through the pandemic as safely as we could"". Scottish Labour group leader Jackie Baillie said the report ""makes clear a pandemic should have been anticipated"", and said ""lives could have been saved"" had warnings been heeded. She said: ""The government knew it could threaten the lives of people across Scotland, they were told the social care system would struggle to cope, and they were warned that access to protective equipment for doctors and nurses simply wasn't good enough. Now we know they didn't act on any of those warnings."" Ms Sturgeon replied that Scotland had ""never once run out of PPE"", and that her government had ""shown leadership"" throughout the pandemic. She said she would look to learn lessons ""every day"", adding: ""Let's engage properly on these things, not just chuck soundbites across a parliamentary chamber."" It is estimated the pandemic will cost the NHS Â£1.67bn in 2020-21 alone.  The knock-on effects mean there is a ""substantial backlog of patients"" waiting to be seen in the NHS, according to Audit Scotland. Stephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, praised the ""extraordinary commitment"" of NHS staff but said the pandemic had ""highlighted the need to deal with long-standing health inequalities"".  He told Good Morning Scotland that the financial sustainability of the NHS had been under threat for years.  Mr Boyle said auditors had emphasised in a number of reports the importance of longer term planning, and shifting the balance of care away from large hospitals to community-based care.  The government was expecting a pandemic.   It had rehearsed scenarios, carried out table-top exercises and simulations, all of which identified the need to better prepare care homes and to improve stockpiles of PPE.   And despite assessing a flu pandemic as a high risk, the government did not identify it as a stand-alone factor when considering the biggest challenges to the health service.   Scotland is not alone in being caught off guard, and the report points to some of the things that went well.   Speedily increasing the capacity of intensive care and hospital beds for example, and rapidly rolling out the use of digital technology. But this is the first time we've seen in black and white from an independent body that there were shortcomings in the preparations.   A public inquiry will later look at the decisions that were made. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said there was ""some concern"" that the government could have been better prepared, especially when it came to PPE for doctors.  He said pre-existing challenges for the NHS had been ""exacerbated by Covid"", and that restarting services was going to be a ""substantial challenge"". Covid has caused or contributed to the deaths of about 9,000 people in Scotland so far, with those from the most deprived areas or ethnic minorities among the worst affected.  The forecasted Â£1.67bn cost of Covid in 2020-21 includes Â£324.5m on PPE and a near 10% rise in staffing costs.  Responding to the report, the Royal College of Nursing said lessons needed to be learned and the ""immense pressure"" staff had faced for sustained period should be recognised.  It said nurses were concerned about potential long-termâ¯risks to their physical and mental health,â¯including PTSD and long Covid.â¯  'Shocking' to see more people in 30s in ICU Planned operations down 35% in December How do hospital numbers compare with April's peak?

Lockdown 'vloggers' fined over prison trip,"Two men, who claimed to be ""vloggers"", have been fined Â£200 each for breaking lockdown rules after travelling from Leeds to Lincoln to film at the prison. Lincolnshire Police said the men, aged 28 and 44, also filmed at a local police station after making the 130-mile round trip to the city on Monday.  When challenged, one of the men told officers he was the director of a media company and was entitled to work. However officers said their trip did not count as an essential journey. Ch Insp Andy Morrice said: ""With a virus spreading so rapidly through contact with others we should all be asking ourselves whether our reason to leave home is truly essential. ""In this case travelling was not deemed essential."" He added that ""personal decisions are critical"" in order to protect people who could ""needlessly"" die from the virus. However, the men claimed they had done nothing wrong. In a video posted on YouTube, they can be heard remonstrating with police about their rights and telling officers they had not broken any rules as they were ""working"". When asked why they were out filming, one said: ""This is my job and it's what I do for a living.  ""I am the director of a media company.""

Apple revamps syringe emoji for Covid vaccines,"Apple is changing its syringe emoji to remove the dripping blood, as it becomes widely used to talk about the Covid-19 vaccine. Apple's new version has nothing inside the needle. ""This makes the emoji more versatile when used to describe Covid-19 vaccination,"" explained Emojipedia, a site that catalogues the icons. The site reports a surge in the use of the syringe emoji last year to talk about the Covid vaccine. Emojipedia said that while the syringe was once associated with blood donation, it saw a noticeable shift to it being used for vaccinations, alongside  other emoji such as a face mask or a microbe. By December, the icon had become associated with words such as ""vaccine"", ""Covid-19"", ""Pfizer"", and ""Moderna"", it said. ð Syringe emoji is now more popular than ever. Previously commonly used for blood donation, this emoji has had new life as a COVID-19 vaccine emoji https://t.co/wxuh0NouK7 pic.twitter.com/HQ4LTDBf6n Apple has not officially made any comment on the revised graphic. But the change was discovered in the beta version for Apple's latest mobile operating system, iOS 14.5, which is likely to be available to ordinary users soon. New emojis must be approved by industry body the Unicode consortium - but existing ones are designed slightly differently by companies such as Apple, making tweaks possible. Google's Android has not announced any similar changes, but the major software makers usually converge on a similar design. In 2016, Apple changed the pistol emoji from a handgun to a water pistol, with Google, Samsung, Microsoft and others eventually following suit. The move was welcomed by the Royal Society for Public Health. It said Apple could play a part ""to increase confidence in Covid-19 vaccines"". ""We applaud everyone who joins in the global effort by doing what they can to reassure those who may be scared of needles or unnecessarily concerned about the vaccinations,"" chief executive Christina Marriott said. The change comes as Apple also placed limitations on developers building ""vaccine passport"" apps - ones that entitle the bearer access to somewhere based on a Covid test or vaccine. It said it had noticed an increase in such apps that generate ""passes"" used to access locations or services. But such apps will no longer be allowed unless they are working with recognised public health authorities or companies associated with them. That includes ""test kit manufacturers, laboratories, or healthcare providers"" as well as government and medical institutions, Apple said. The change is designed ""to ensure these apps responsibly handle sensitive data and provide reliable functionality"". It is the latest hurdle for so-called vaccine passports, which have long been proposed as an eventual alternative solution to lockdowns. But on Wednesday, UK think tank the Ada Lovelace Institute, which looks at how big data affects society, warned that such a system could present a host of issues. There appears to be growing momentum for a ""no jab, no job"" policy among some employers, but it's quite unlikely to happen in the short term and here's why.  There are a host of technical, legal and political challenges for any company wanting to know about the vaccine status of their staff or customers. First, there is no officially recognised vaccine passport or certificate out there - and there is unlikely to be one until the government gives the go-ahead for any scheme to get access to NHS records.  The Ada Lovelace Institute's report today warns against rushing out vaccine passports before there is clear evidence that a vaccinated person cannot pass on Covid-19 to someone else. Even when there is evidence, the report warns such a scheme could exacerbate mistrust in vaccines by making them appear mandatory.   Lawyers say that treating employees who haven't been vaccinated differently could amount to discrimination, and data protection specialists say demanding to know someone's vaccine status may be against the law.

South Africa rolls out vaccination programme,"By Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check South Africa has started Covid-19 vaccinations following the suspension of an earlier plan to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. More than a third of all Covid-19 cases in Africa have been in South Africa, with a new variant of the virus accounting for most of the new cases there. South Africa is using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine which is administered as a single dose. The country has received 80,000 doses of this vaccine, which has been shown to be effective against the variant first identified in South Africa. President Cyril Ramaphosa says the country has secured nine million doses in total, and more doses are expected.  Pfizer has also committed 20 million vaccine doses, with deliveries expected at the end of the first quarter of this year. Early in February, the country received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from India. However, it put the roll out of these on hold, following a study that showed ""disappointing"" results against the country's new Covid-19 strain. The country is now considering administering the vaccine to 100,000 people to monitor its impact before deciding if it should be used more widely. South Africa says it has so far secured enough doses for the target population of 40 million. However, there has been criticism that the government was too slow to act. Apart from bilateral deals with manufacturers, South Africa is sourcing vaccines from the World Health Organization-backed Covax scheme, as well as through an African Union programme. Covax is a global initiative in which countries pool their resources to support the development of vaccines with a view to ensure that all countries receive a fair supply of effective vaccines. South Africa expects to acquire doses for around 10% of the population - 12 million vaccine doses - through Covax and has been told it will receive them from April through to June. The African Union established the African vaccine acquisition task team last year to source vaccine doses for the continent. There's been concern that many poorer, less-developed countries are being left behind in the global competition to secure vaccine supplies. However, critics suggest that South Africa - as the richest country in Africa - should not have been in this position.  ""The stunning reality is that [South Africa] has neither a secured vaccine supply nor a plan for mass inoculation in the foreseeable future that can withstand scrutiny,"" the Progressive Health Forum, a group of leading medical experts in the country, said in January. The opposition Democratic Alliance had earlier called on the government to give full details of its negotiations with vaccine suppliers, accusing the government of ""dropping the ball"". It claims the government only started to talk to vaccine suppliers in early January. And it's also emerged that South Africa will pay more than twice the price for AstraZeneca vaccines than countries in Europe. Dr Anban Pillay, deputy director-general at the Ministry of Health, says the country was in touch with manufacturers as far back as last September. ""The vaccines that most of the other countries have procured are vaccines that may not be ideal for South Africa from various perspectives,"" he has said. He said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine wouldn't be appropriate for mass vaccination, often in remote rural areas, due to its storage requirements of -70C. And he added that the ministerial advisory committee advised against using this vaccine. ""We were waiting for the other vaccines that we can use as a mass rollout campaign, and those vaccines had not come through the production line yet,"" he said. He also said some countries have gone ahead with some vaccines without completed clinical trial data, which wouldn't be allowed by the regulator in South Africa. The government says it couldn't have signed deals early without knowing whether the vaccines were safe and effective, as this would have been in contravention of national financial laws. Wealthy countries, such as the UK and others, signed deals for prospective vaccines as early as July last year while they were still in development and undergoing trials. And countries who can afford to pay most at the earliest stage of development and production can often secure an advantage, according to experts. South Africa did take part in a trial for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine starting in July last year, and involving some 2,000 people. It's unclear whether or not the authorities used this to begin negotiating for supplies from the manufacturer. Research by Duke University in the US tracking advance vaccine commitments by country shows that the majority of doses purchased so far have been for high income countries.

Partygoers' £600 fines for double Covid breaches,"Two people have been fined Â£600 each for twice breaching Covid rules after being caught at two separate parties on the same night. The pair were first fined after being found at a gathering in Scarborough at 22:00 GMT on Saturday, according to North Yorkshire Police. Officers then discovered them again three hours later at another party four miles away. The force said it had issued 186 Covid penalty notices over the last week. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, SuptÂ MikeÂ Walker told a meeting of the North Yorkshire Local Resilience Forum that it was the highest number of fines issued since the new coronavirus lockdown began.  Supt Walker said some people ""did not care"" they were breaking the rules. ""For the reckless minorityÂ who think the regulations do not apply to them, we will continue to actively target those blatant breaches while providing a highly visible and reassuringÂ presence for the wider community who are doing the right thing,"" he said. Of the 186 penalty notices issued in the last seven days, 64 were in the Scarborough district and 55 were in York. A total of 48 of the Scarborough fines were given to residents and 16 to visitors. Supt Walker said 15 people from Manchester had been fined after they visited Whitby, with one group telling officers they had come to the resort to ""look at the sea"". Other incidents included a couple from Hull who went to Grosmont for a walk and three people from Leeds who went to Selby to look around a derelict building. Supt Walker added: ""These are clearly blatant breaches of the health protection regulations.

Disney-mad family embark on stay-at-home 'holiday',"A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey.  Taking time out from their mid-week getaway, the Disney-mad family from Leeds said it had lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet.  Scarlett, four, said they arrived and found ""leaves and flowers everywhere"". The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, with husband Dom kept in the dark about the itinerary along with their daughter.  Their adventures were widely shared on Twitter, with Mrs Hodgson praised for her ""creativity and attention to detail"". The Hodgsons had saved for a ""trip of a lifetime"" involving visits to all six Disney resorts during 2020, but soon realised the holiday needed to be put on hold. Weâve all been feeling a bit down recently and so my wife decided we were going on holiday. I was told that I was taking Tuesday and Wednesday off and sheâs been working on a secret plan ð§µ Mrs Hodgson said the inspiration for the housebound holiday came from seeing videos of people mocking up the experience of being on an aeroplane using a tablet computer and a washing machine.  ""I started planning it two to three weeks before, most of that was list-making, itinerary-building and buying the occasional decorations,"" she said. Scarlett said: ""I loved being on the aeroplane with the snacks and watching a film, then we came home and there was leaves and flowers everywhere."" Mr Hodgson said his expectations were ""blown out of the water"". ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room,"" he said. He continued: ""This lockdown has the combination of being cold and wet so walks aren't as easy. ""Scarlett is now at school rather than nursery so having to manage us both working full-time and managing the education and entertainment of our daughter has led to lots of late nights and team work."" The family said the remainder of the holiday would include family games, time by the ""pool"" and getting a takeaway to sample ""some of the local cuisine"".

Takeaways and deliveries to restart from Monday,"Takeaways and non-essential deliveries will be allowed in Guernsey from Monday as the island enters stage one of its exit from lockdown. Bubbles of two households and outdoor gatherings of up to five people will also be permitted. Anyone meeting outdoors not in a bubble must maintain social distancing, the States of Guernsey said. Some businesses can return to work, with up to 10 staff allowed on outdoor sites and five in indoor spaces. Alderney will move into stage one earlier - from Thursday - and Sark has already relaxed restrictions. Non-essential businesses in the islands were closed on 23 January when the island went into lockdown after new cases of Covid-19 were identified. Under stage one, non public-facing businesses will be allowed to operate, including non-essential shops where goods can be sold online and delivered, estate agents, construction, garages and catering services. Some businesses have already reopened if they can be staffed by one person, including non-essential delivery services. Two metre (6ft) social distancing at workplaces will be mandatory and hand washing facilities must be provided, according to the States' three-stage exit from lockdown framework. Businesses planning to reopen must inform the States, maintain records and show what steps they have taken to mitigate risk of coronavirus transmission. The move comes as the bailiwick's active cases fall to 123, with 496 coronavirus infections identified since the outbreak began.  Chairman of the Civil Contingencies Authority Peter Ferbrache said islanders have done a ""tremendous job"" getting the more transmissible variant of the virus under control. He said: ""But as we continue to see cases, including those where the source is not clear, we need to tread very carefully."" Deputy Ferbrache acknowledged stage one was a ""very limited"" release of lockdown rules, which was to ensure the island does not ""see another sudden rise in cases"".  ""But it's a positive step forward and does allow us to see some of our loved ones again, and allow some parts of the economy to get back to work in a careful, controlled way."" Stage two - for which no date has yet been set - will permit gatherings of up to 30 people, restaurants, hotels and pubs operating with table service only and the reopening of non-essential shops. However, nightclubs will remain closed and public singing, or playing of woodwind and brass instruments will still be banned. The criteria for entering the second stage includes there being no new clusters of infections or individual cases that cannot be controlled by testing, contact tracing and self-isolation, having adequate health care capacity and the continued roll-out of the vaccine.

World's first human Covid trials to start in UK,"Healthy, young volunteers will be infected with coronavirus to test vaccines and treatments in the world's first Covid-19 ""human challenge"" study, which will take place in the UK. The study, which has received ethics approval, will start in the next few weeks and recruit 90 people aged 18-30. They will be exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment while medics monitor their health. The UK has given doses of a Covid vaccine to more than 15 million people. Human challenge studies have played a vital role in pushing the development of treatments for a number of diseases, including malaria, typhoid, cholera and flu. The trials will help scientists work out the smallest amount of coronavirus needed to cause infection, and how the body's immune system reacts to it. This will give doctors a better understanding of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, which will feed into the development of vaccines and treatments. The Human Challenge study is being delivered by a partnership between the UK government's Vaccines Taskforce, Imperial College London, the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust and the company hVIVO, which has pioneered viral human challenge models. Clive Dix, interim chair of the Vaccines Taskforce, said: ""We have secured a number of safe and effective vaccines for the UK, but it is essential that we continue to develop new vaccines and treatments for Covid-19.  ""We expect these studies to offer unique insights into how the virus works and help us understand which promising vaccines offer the best chance of preventing the infection."" We have hugely effective Covid-19 vaccines already so why do we need challenge trials? First, they tell us things that are almost impossible to discover in the real world. How much virus does it take to start an infection? How does the immune system mount its initial defence? Can you tell which people will develop symptoms or not? The trials in the UK will start off by focusing on these fundamental scientific questions. But there are also new vaccines in the pipeline and the virus itself is evolving.  Later this year it will become almost impossible to run large-scale Covid vaccine trials in the UK because so many people will have been immunised.  But challenge trials involving just a small numbers of volunteers will still give the answer to crucial questions - from how second-generation vaccines compare, to whether vaccines protect against new variants.  Chief investigator Dr Chris Chiu, from Imperial College London, said: ""We are asking for volunteers aged between 18 and 30 to join this research endeavour and help us to understand how the virus infects people and how it passes so successfully between us."" Volunteers will be screened to check they are healthy and have not been infected by the virus before. They will have the virus squirted up their nose and then spend 14 days quarantining in hospital, while being closely monitored by a medical team. Finding out how the virus grows in the nose and analysing the very early stages of infection in people before symptoms develop are two main aims. Volunteers will be compensated for their time, to the tune of around Â£4,500 over the course of a year, which will include follow-up tests. Initially, the study will use the virus that has been circulating in the UK since the pandemic began in March, which is of low risk to healthy adults, to deliberately infect volunteers. In time, a small numbers of volunteers are likely to be given an approved vaccine and then exposed to the new variants, helping scientists to find out the most effective jabs - but this phase of the study has not yet been given the go-ahead.

'Self-isolation cost my family £700 in a month',"By Paul MartinBBC News Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. The Welsh Government announced on Wednesday it is expanding the scheme to make more people eligible. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Since the coronavirus self-isolation support programme opened in November, 27,209 applications have been made in Wales. Of those, 8,421 were approved, 15,772 rejected and 3,016 had a decision pending as of 2 February. The Welsh Government said feedback from councils suggested rejected applications were mainly due to individuals being ineligible or not providing the necessary evidence. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The government is now expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Ministers said the changes would make an additional 170,000 people potentially eligible for the grant, with the scheme extended to June. The new rules will not be backdated.  Ms Moore, from Holywell, saw her household income drop by about Â£700 when her husband Jason and son isolated last month. They work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days. But when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect. Another 111 call handler later said they should not have been told to isolate. Ms Moore is disabled and does not work, so the household income took a hit. ""The bills have all been paid but it was not very nice. The way the system works is disgusting and wrong,"" she said. Lynette Jackson, from Wrexham, lost about Â£400 when she isolated in the run-up to Christmas after a colleague at her factory tested positive. When she applied for a discretionary payment she was told she was too late as 17 days had passed since her isolation ended. ""I did what I was meant to do. I think people will stop doing it if they're losing money,"" she said. ""I would only isolate again in the future if I'm ill, I can't afford to do it again."" One self-employed woman from Cardiff said she would not qualify for the grant so is avoiding getting tested and will ignore calls from contact tracers. ""I've done everything to avoid being told to isolate,"" she added. ""If it's a choice between paying rent and bills vs self-isolating I'm going to pay the bills."" But Helen Harris, from Newport, did receive the payment and said it was a ""such a relief"", with her baby Arwen currently in hospital for heart treatment. Helen is on maternity leave and her husband Andrew lost about Â£700 when they had to isolate. ""I've been completely worried anyway... and then obviously we had the financial worries about if we could keep the house, if we could pay the bills,"" she said. ""It's just a massive weight off our mind, it's just something we don't have to worry about because it means that the money's now there for us to pay the bills that we need."" Ms Harris said she felt for people who are not given the grant. ""The government should definitely be supporting people because people are struggling with mental health and everything, they need to know they can pay their bills,"" she added. A Swansea University study of people asked to self-isolate in Wales found more than a quarter of those surveyed said it negatively affected their income. Local government minister Julie James said feedback from councils showed the scheme was working well, but lack of income was still being reported as a barrier for self-isolating. ""Self-isolation is key if we are to stop the spread of coronavirus and with more community testing programmes planned in the coming months it is vital we enhance the scheme to help more people self-isolate and receive the financial support they need,"" she said. Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for finance and health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said: ""Self-isolation remains a vital part of stopping the spread of coronavirus, and fear of financial hardship is one of the barriers to effective self-isolation.  ""If support isn't sufficient, and isn't reaching the right people, our efforts to tackle the pandemic suffer."" He called for the payment to be brought up to Â£800 and said it will be an ""important step"" in tackling the virus as we come out of lockdown. The pandemic has had a huge impact on people's day-to-day lives in Wales, with mental health problems worsening across different age groups in the past year.  In adults, the proportion of individuals showing symptoms of depression has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics says. And Covid-19 has had a ""crushing impact"" on the lives of children and young people, according to the Children's Commissioner for Wales.

Blended learning to continue for 'some time',"Some Scottish school pupils could be partly taught from home indefinitely, the education secretary has acknowledged. John Swinney said that physical distancing would continue to be needed in secondary schools, meaning fewer pupils in classrooms at one time. Children in pre-school and P1-P3 are to return for face-to-face teaching from Monday, as well as some senior pupils. Other age groups will continue to learn from home. Following the announcement about early years pupils on Tuesday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest. It comes as the Welsh government said children aged three to seven would also return to school on Monday. However, the prime minister has yet to announce plans for the reopening of schools in England, but said they would not return before 8 March. The Northern Ireland Executive is also yet to decide if some or all pupils can return on 8 March. Teaching unions in Scotland have said that some schools will need to follow a blended learning model for a ""considerable"" period of time to maintain social distancing. When asked on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme if this was a picture he recognised, Mr Swinney responded: ""Yes. The scientific advice that I have available to me just now recognises that physical distancing will be required for at least senior phase pupils within our secondary schools. ""That obviously means that we can only have fewer pupils in schools at the same time. So, there is every possibility that unless that advice changes, that we will have to operate on such a model."" Mr Swinney said he could not be ""definitive about timescales"", but said the government would return pupils to classrooms full-time ""as soon as it was safe"". Scotland largest teaching union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), has expressed reservations about any return to the classroom. General secretary Larry Flanagan said teachers would be ""understandably nervous"" about the return of some pupils given infection rates remained above the World Health Organisation's definition of ""under control"". He also urged the Scottish government to reconsider backing medical grade face masks for staff ""as a matter of urgency"". Mr Flanagan said: ""Against this backdrop, the EIS continues to believe that a blended learning model, with around half of pupils in classes at any one time to allow for physical distancing, would have provided a more cautious and more appropriate basis for pupils returning to schools."" Seamus Searson, general secretary at the Scottish Secondary Teachers' Association, said it important that social distancing was enforced in secondary schools. He added: ""We also would like to see that pupils wear face coverings at all times. And equally and more importantly for us is that when youngsters refuse then they shouldn't be allowed to be in school."" As well as the youngest pupils, a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work will return to schools from Monday. There will also be a limited increase in the provision for vulnerable children - specifically those with the most significant additional support needs - where schools believe this is essential. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney also responded to criticism from one of the architects of the Curriculum for Excellence, Dr Keir Bloomer, who said he could see ""no reason"" why a review into Scotland's secondary education system had been delayed. Dr Bloomer had suggested the government was trying to get the review's author's, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to ""alter what it says"". However, Mr Swinney rejected that and said the delay was because of the ""thoroughness and the scale of the work"" that had to be done during a pandemic. He said: ""The report is not finished. The OECD will share draft findings in March with stakeholders in Scotland to develop their thinking and the report will be published in June. ""The criticism that was made by Keir Bloomer is unsubstantiated and unwarranted and it has no place in the debate on such important issues.""

Seven symptoms 'should trigger Covid test',"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  Researchers want the government to add fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea to the existing three symptoms which trigger a Covid test. Currently, anyone with a cough, fever or loss of smell or taste qualifies. Testing for these additional symptoms could pick up 40% more cases, King's College London and the Zoe Symptom Study app have suggested.  However, this would mean many more people who don't have the virus being tested. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""An expert scientific group keeps the symptoms of Covid-19 under review.  ""The main symptoms have been carefully selected to capture those most likely to have Covid-19, while not capturing a great number of people who do not."" The Zoe team was the group to first identify loss of smell and taste as a symptom of Covid, leading to it being added to the official symptoms list. They spotted this by looking at the symptoms reported by people using their Covid Symptom Study mobile app, who went on to test positive.  By analysing data from more than 120,000 adults logging potential symptoms on the app, of which 1,200 reported a positive test, the team identified seven common symptoms. The classic three, any of which already qualify people for the more sensitive PCR test which is processed in a lab, are: And the further four already mentioned, including a sore throat and diarrhoea. Anyone reporting one of this wider group of symptoms was invited by Zoe to take a PCR test. While the seven symptoms suggested by the Zoe app may be features of early-stage Covid, they are also extremely common and may have many other causes. The concern is that if everyone with a headache goes for a Covid test, it could overwhelm the system.  GP Dr Margaret McCartney told BBC Radio 4's Inside Health programme that a ""pragmatic"" approach was needed, with those living in areas with high levels of the virus treating those wider symptoms with more suspicion than those in low-Covid areas. The Zoe team does acknowledge the strategy would increase the number of people without the virus being tested - rising from 46 negative tests for every positive to 95 negatives for every case identified if the seven symptoms were used.  But Dr Claire Steves, lead scientist on the app, said, ""When PCR testing was scarcely available, it made sense to restrict it.  ""Now in the UK we have plenty of tests available, thanks to so much effort by labs all over the country, and every positive person detected could save lives.""  Prof Tim Spector, who is leading the project, said: ""We've known since the beginning that just focusing testing on the classic triad of cough, fever and anosmia [loss of smell] misses a significant proportion of cases. ""For us, the message for the public is clear: 'If you're feeling newly unwell, it could be Covid and you should get a test'."" He added that this was ""especially important"", since new variants could cause different symptoms.  A study by the Office for National Statistics found a cough, fatigue, sore throat and muscle pain may be more common in people who tested positive for the UK variant of coronavirus. A DHSC spokesperson said: ""Anyone experiencing the main symptoms - a high temperature, a new continuous cough, or a loss or change to sense of smell or taste - should get a test as soon as possible, and immediately self-isolate along with their household."" Those with no symptoms, or symptoms outside of those three, may be able to access rapid testing through their local council or their workplace.   What are the symptoms for the new Covid variants? Who can get a coronavirus test?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/help-56096264,1
Marble Arch viewing platform to 'lure shoppers back',"A temporary grass-covered viewing platform will be built at Marble Arch to attract visitors back to central London after the pandemic. The construction on one of the world's most famous shopping streets will house a visitor centre beneath it. It is part of Westminster Council's Â£150m blueprint to revitalise the Oxford Street area. The council hopes the visitor centre will help the area ""climb back"" to post-Covid prosperity. A planning application for the ""hill"" was lodged with Westminster Council earlier. Work is expected to start on the construction of the platform in the next few weeks and will operate for six months, starting in summer. The area has already felt the strain of the pandemic as Topshop and Debenhams announced their closure earlier this year, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Westminster Council said: ""Our proposed Marble Arch Hill temporary visitor attraction at Marble Arch signifies our ambitious approach to the district.  ""It will be important for bringing in visitors to support the local economy. However, it will offer so much more.  ""We hope it will give people an opportunity to look afresh and with wonder at this well known, but sadly increasingly overlooked, area to recognise its beauty and importance."" Research by the New West End Company suggests that over one-fifth of Oxford Street may not reopen when the latest lockdown ends. Chief executive, Jace Tyrrell, said: ""The past 12 months have been the toughest on record for businesses on Oxford Street and the surrounding area, and these ambitious plans are a sign of a forward thinking, sustainable and agile future for the district, creating an altogether stronger and more exciting high street that caters to the needs of the ever-evolving consumer."" It is hoped the attraction will also will support the hotel and hospitality businesses in the area. Kay Buxton of the Marble Arch London BID (Business Improvement District) said: ""Marble Arch Hill is a clarion call to the recovery of London's hospitality and leisure sector, in an enduring, world-renowned destination.  ""We hope that once visitors and tourists are able to return, that they take advantage of this spectacular attraction and whilst here, book a stay at one of the fantastic hotels located in the area and enjoy the excellent mix of restaurants, cafes and bars we have on offer.""

Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April',"Waiting lists for hospital treatment could more than double by April and hit 10 million in England, the Reform think tank is warning. A worst-case scenario could see delays continue as a new wave of referrals are made, Reform said.  Treatment referrals by GPs were six million lower in 2020 than the year before, suggesting a mounting backlog. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said ""trumpeting worst-case scenarios"" was ""not helpful"".  He said while there was a ""significant problem"" which would take time and investment to overcome, a similar methodology had suggested waiting lists would hit 10 million by December last year, but they were currently at 4.4 million. He also warned the NHS is likely to be ""at full stretch"" for at least another six weeks and England was still ""some way away"" from being able to start lifting restrictions. Are you waiting for hospital treatment? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Mr Hopson, whose organisation represents NHS trusts in England, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say case numbers are ""still far too high"" to end virus curbs.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the end of April, once the top nine priority groups had been vaccinated would be the ""logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions"". Setting out the conditions they believe are needed to allow current restrictions to relax, trust leaders outlined four tests that could be applied. Among the tests are: a ""significant"" drop in case numbers; a return to normal NHS capacity; solid progress with vaccinations; and a ""robust and effective"" strategy to identify new virus variants. Mr Johnson is due to outline a roadmap for easing the current national lockdown in England on Monday. Meanwhile, the head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, Clive Dix, told Sky News all adults could be fully vaccinated by August ""or maybe sooner if we need to"". Reform - a centre-right think tank that focuses on public services - praised the work of frontline NHS staff, but said more now needed to be done to tackle the growing backlog in care. Community diagnostic centres for cancer, cardiac and other conditions should be set up to restart screening programmes halted by the pandemic, coupled with a renewed focus on prioritising those most urgently in need of care currently on waiting lists, it said. And for routine treatments, it said more use should be made of the private sector. Reform's Eleonora Harwich said: ""We must never have the equivalent of a 'National Covid Service' again. ""This is a system problem and in no way detracts from the heroic effort of NHS staff battling Covid-19.  ""However, the cessation of so much non-Covid care means patients are facing more serious health conditions or disabilities, and some will die prematurely."" Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, accepted the NHS faced a ""mammoth task"" to tackle the backlog - although she questioned the waiting list prediction of 10 million people by April. She said the real problem was that the NHS was under-funded and had been operating ""at the top of its capacity for far too long"". Responding to accusations that the NHS has become a Covid-only service, Ms McCay pointed out cancer services were now operating at pre-pandemic levels. Mr Hopson also said that Reform's suggestion that the NHS had been a ""Covid-only service"" was not helpful as staff had worked hard to keep other services going. Prof Neil Mortensen, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said tackling the backlog would require both the use of the private sector, and extra investment in the NHS. A further 10,625 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, alongside another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Over 16 million people have now received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine across the UK.

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The outgoing children's commissioner for England has called on the government to put vulnerable young people ""centre stage"" of plans to ""level-up"" the country. Anne Longfield, in her last speech after six years in the job, will say that an entire generation risks being forever defined by the coronavirus pandemic and will call for a new ""Covid Covenant"" for education and support in every community. For its part, the government says the most vulnerable children in England can still go to school and it has also worked to provide laptops and data packages for home-schooling. Research by the think tank Reform suggests hospital waiting lists in England could more than double and hit 10 million by April. While praising NHS staff for their work during the pandemic, Reform said more needs to be done to deal with the growing backlog in hospitals. The NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, has questioned Reform's predictions, saying the main issues were under-funding and the health service operating near capacity. Work has begun to assess the effectiveness of the coronavirus jab developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca on children. Around 300 volunteers aged between six and 17 are taking part in the trial, with 240 receiving the Covid vaccine and the rest getting a meningitis jab. While children can catch and spread coronavirus they are unlikely to become very sick with it. But the Oxford researchers say this trial is needed to find out whether some young people might benefit from being vaccinated. BBC News analysis of data from England suggests the vaccine rollout in England is starting to push down the number of deaths from coronavirus. According to the data currently available, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s. The number of Covid cases is also down, but this statistic is not a reliable indicator of whether the vaccines are working because the jabs should prevent serious infections. It is expected the government will release more details next week as part of its plans to ease the lockdown in England. With more than 118,000 people in the UK now having died with coronavirus, many of us may end up feeling a bit numb. This is not unusual, psychologist Dr Meg Arroll tells BBC Newsbeat, and is a form of self-preservation. She says that some people may be suffering from ""compassion fatigue"". If you're feeling out of touch with your emotions, there are things you can do to help, including remembering it is OK not to be OK at the moment, looking after your physical health and taking time out for yourself.

Covid vaccines a 'lifeline' for housebound people,"By Marie-Louise ConnollyBBC News NI Health Correspondent Delivering Covid-19 vaccines to housebound patients is ""like a light at the end of a very dark tunnel"", a community nurse has said. Gillian Quinn works at Bangor Health Centre which is responsible for delivering vaccines to people's homes in the South Eastern Health Trust. So far over 2,800 people in Northern Ireland who are clinically housebound have received their first Covid jab. Vaccinating that cohort of patients began on 6 February. They have been receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. While just under 16,000 people are registered to receive the flu vaccine at home according to the Department of Health a number of housebound people have been receiving their Covid jab at their GP practice as well.   Among those to have received their vaccine last week was Dustin Wright who is 49 and lives in Bangor. Mr Wright, who has multiple sclerosis (MS), has been housebound for years and said he was ""relieved"" as he has also been isolating for months. ""Because I have MS I am a higher risk category so getting the jab soothes my mind and will eventually allow people to call round to the house to visit again,"" he told BBC News NI. Nurse Quinn said she and others are a lifeline to many housebound patients and bringing the vaccine to them is just another development in the Covid story. She explained: ""Last March was tough on all of us, we were working in the unknown, we were scared and just trying to get on with doing our job. ""But almost a year on look how far we have come.""   BBC News NI spent a day with Gillian as she went about her house calls. Temperatures outside were below zero and a harsh wind followed Gillian as she walked down driveways armed with heavily laden medical bags. ""It's challenging but it's also so rewarding when you get to vaccinate people like Dustin who can't leave their house, patients are delighted to see us and we are delighted at being able to give them their jab,"" she said. One challenge is that within each vial there are up to 10 doses of the vaccine, which has a short shelf life of about six hours. Gillian is constantly monitoring numbers including those on her watch as she drives between houses vaccinating patients. The vial is kept in a portable fridge which is secured in the boot of her car. ""The cold chain is important, we have to be very regimental with that,"" she outlined. ""We have to make sure that the vial is kept between certain temperatures and we have six hours to vaccinate 10, possibly 11, people each day. So it can be a rush."" After leaving Dustin, Gillian travelled several miles to vaccinate Alan McKinney, who is 77 and has dementia. Each patient gets a cheery greeting as Gillian puts on her personal protective equipment (PPE), sanitises her hands and prepares the injection. After it was administered Mr McKinney said he felt ""100%"" and was happy he and his wife had got their first jab. In order to roll-out the vaccine, community nurses work closely with GPs in individual practices. It is a well-oiled machine as practices attempt to get around as many of their patients as quickly as possible. Dr David Reid, who is a GP in Bangor Health Centre, said his team was delivering it as quickly as they get it but he acknowledged some are ""feeling anxious and frustrated"". ""That creates a massive logistical and administrative challenge and that is being met by practice managers and the admin team. ""To be honest, the easiest thing is putting the vaccine in someone's arm."" However, the pace of the roll-out is not in step across the country. According to Dr Reid, that is due to what nurses are available in each practice and how quickly they are able to call members of the public to come into the surgery. ""I'm sure those behind the scenes are trying to do this as equitably as they can,"" Dr Reid said. ""There are frustrations and anxieties but I think, if we look at where we are in Northern Ireland and as part of the UK, our roll-out has been incredible. ""I would just ask people to be patient."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health said ""it is anticipated that the vast majority of housebound patients will be vaccinated over the next few weeks"".

Lockdown diaries: 'No-one has seen him as a baby',"Olivia Hall gave birth at Southmead Hospital in Bristol at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first to be placed in isolation at the maternity hospital. This is her take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. ""I have flashbacks to Harrison's birth on 25 March during the first lockdown.  ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park.  ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously.  ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone.  ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once.  ""The feeling of isolation in the third lockdown has hit harder this time, like a roadblock that you've met for the eighth time; life frozen, time lost.  ""I don't know whether it is because it is colder and the days shorter, or if it is due just to complete saturation of relentless isolation.  ""Every new parent suffers from sleep deprivation but the dark, lonely nights with a sleepless breastfeeding baby are now contaminated by worry.  ""Are we taking enough precautions? Was it right to put my child on the swing? Should I be walking with other households? Should I be giving him to my elderly parents? Should I be taking my child to the supermarket?  ""I wish he could go to Gymboree, Sing and Sign and Adventure Babies to develop his skills but perhaps it is the social interaction that should concern me more.  ""Instead, I dance around the kitchen acting out animal characters in strange voices like a madwoman, in a desperate attempt to provide entertainment as my son stares at my exhausted body, bemused.  ""It saddens me that no-one has seen Harrison as a baby, and now he's a toddler.

Worries about parents' drug and alcohol use soar,"By Colette HumeBBC Wales News There has been a dramatic rise in the number of children needing help because their parents are misusing drugs and alcohol, a charity says. NSPCC Wales have made 572 substance misuse referrals to police and agencies in the past 10 months - a rise of 72% since the pandemic began. One woman whose mother drank heavily said school was her escape, but children are now ""stuck at home"". The Welsh Government said it invests Â£54m in substance misuse services. Of that, Â£2.75m is ring-fenced for children and families. Ashley, from Denbighshire, said she felt ""trapped"" in her own home growing up because her mother was addicted to alcohol. ""My mum used to drink every day as far back as I can remember,"" Ashley, now 25, said. ""Her drinking meant that I had to be the mum to my siblings and I didn't really have a life... My only escape from this was school.  ""I didn't speak to anyone about what was going on at home because I didn't realise it was wrong. That was just my life and I thought it was normal. ""My heart breaks for the children out there that are currently going through this and have no outlet, stuck at home surrounded by alcohol abuse with no escape."" The NSPCC is calling on the government, health boards and councils to ensure substance misuse services continue throughout the pandemic. Average monthly referrals are 72% higher than in the first three months of 2020, the charity said, and called for a Covid recovery strategy to support children and young people who have experienced trauma. Kam Thandi, head of NSPCC Helpline, said: ""The Covid-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns have created a perfect storm for families affected by this problem. ""We've not only seen a rise in contacts and referrals but we're also seeing families who weren't previously known to children's services requiring help and support for substance misuse. ""The pressures on families at the moment are unprecedented and it is no surprise that our helpline is hearing that parents and carers are struggling with substance misuse."" Living in a house where a parent of carer is misusing substances does not necessarily mean children will encounter abuse, but the NSPCC said it made it more difficult for those looking after children to provide safe and consistent care. Deaths caused by alcohol in Wales and England hit a new high during the first nine months of 2020, with provisional official figures showing 5,460 deaths registered with this cause between January and September - the biggest toll recorded since records began in 2001. Rhian Williams, 36, from Swansea, is coming up to a year of sobriety after what she described as ""15 years of worshipping wine"". She says she drank almost every night of the week and it affected her relationship with her husband Chris.  Ms Williams now works as a counsellor with women who have cut down or given up drinking alcohol.  ""It's been an incredibly difficult time for everyone, you're in the house... what are you going to do?,"" she said. ""You're going to have a drink if you have alcohol in the house, I know I would have done that, that would have been my go-to and that's the problem. ""It's been sold to us as something to relax us and is the answer to our stressful situation, unfortunately it's not, but the more we do it, the more our body learns that's what we want to do and that's sadly how we can become dependent and get into more addictive behaviours."" A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are extremely concerned about some of the issues which have been raised in this report and the vulnerability of some of our children.  ""At an early point in the pandemic response we sought reassurance that support for families and children was kept in place."" The pandemic has had a huge impact on people's day-to-day lives in Wales, with mental health problems worsening across different age groups in the past year.  In adults, the proportion of individuals showing symptoms of depression has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics says. And Covid-19 has had a ""crushing impact"" on the lives of children and young people, according to the Children's Commissioner for Wales.

"Peru's ex-president sought early jab, doctors say","Former Peruvian President MartÃ­n Vizcarra requested and received an early vaccination against Covid-19 out of turn, a doctor has told lawmakers. Mr Vizcarra has said he and his wife were vaccinated as clinical trial volunteers in October last year. But testifying in parliament on Tuesday, Dr GermÃ¡n MÃ¡laga, who led the vaccine trial, disputed this. ""He asked me for two vaccines,"" Dr MÃ¡laga, of the Cayetano Heredia University in the capital Lima, said. Mr Vizcarra was impeached and removed as president by parliament over separate corruption allegations in November last year. Now a newspaper report about his early inoculation has embroiled the former president and other government officials in another political scandal. On Monday, Peru's current President, Francisco Sagasti, said 487 people had been ""irregularly"" vaccinated with doses of a jab made by Chinese firm Sinopharm. Mr Sagasti said these people, including many public officials, ""took advantage of their position to be immunised with the Sinopharm vaccines that came in addition to those used in clinical trials"". Mr Sagasti's revelations came days after a newspaper report revealed Mr Vizcarra, 57, and his wife, Maribel DÃ­az Cabello, 50, had received early doses of the Sinopharm vaccine. Mr Vizcarra has confirmed the report, admitting he and two family members had received vaccines in October last year. On Tuesday, Dr MÃ¡laga told Peru's Congress that Mr Vizcarra had approached him about being vaccinated on 1 October, when the drug was being rolled out to 12,000 trial volunteers. Mr Vizcarra knew he would be getting the real jab, not a placebo, Dr MÃ¡laga said. Volunteers in blind trials do not know which of the two they will receive. The doctor said he did not believe he was acting irregularly, because he thought the president needed protection for leading the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.  ""I did not think about legal, political or calculations,"" he said. The scandal has led to the resignations of the country's health and foreign ministers, as well as two vice ministers involved in efforts to control the virus. The early vaccinations of ministers have stirred anger in Peru, which only began its immunisation drive, starting with healthcare workers, in early February. Peru has recorded more than 1.2 million cases of coronavirus, with 43,880 deaths related to Covid-19, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.

Is four years too long to wait for justice?,"Dominic CascianiHome and legal correspondent@BBCDomCon Twitter The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard?  If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in.  For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out.  In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences.  Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court.  Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated.  Weeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long.  ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022.  ""I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?"" Every week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice.  ""I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening? ""There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022.  ""I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down."" Jenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice.  Last month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 cases was of grave concern.  In the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000.  There was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside.  Speaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time.  Today, he's announcing 14 more temporary ""Nightingale Courts"" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of Â£113m of spending to alleviate the pressure.  Part of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new ""super court"" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process.  ""I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year."" The Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed.  In 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could ""sit"" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit.  Mr Buckland says reductions in ""sitting days"" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were.  ""I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,"" he says. ""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that."" It's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge.  So what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo?  ""That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective. ""I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems."" One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case.  The government has also pledged an extra Â£40m to support vulnerable people waiting for trial - including Â£16m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice.  Jenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long.  ""I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?"" she says. ""How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out? ""The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that. And you might put your Nightingale courts up and running, but you need to go back to asking: what do the victims need?""

Why you might be feeling numb to Covid news,"By Megan Lawton and Levi JouavelNewsbeat Reporters Flat, disheartened, numb. Just three emotions you might be experiencing at the moment. And if so, you're not alone.  When the UK Covid death toll reached 100,000, it was a devastating milestone. Now it's over 117,000.  Many of us struggle to process such huge numbers, which get bigger by the day. Carrying on as normal seems inadequate, but what else can you do? ""No-one is a bad person if they feel a bit numb. It's self-protection,"" says psychologist and author Dr Meg Arroll.  She tells Radio 1 Newsbeat that lots of us are suffering from ""compassion fatigue"", after living through a pandemic for so long. ""Normally you would only see this in doctors and nurses. But because we have these Covid statistics every day and we hear the stories of people who've passed away every day, feeling numb is a self-preservation process that stops things becoming overwhelming."" That's something 24-year-old Simone Ziel can relate to. Continually hearing about Covid-related deaths on the news has left her feeling ""deflated"". ""I'm numb to the high numbers,"" she says. ""It's not normal to be told every day that there are thousands of people passing away. ""I'm not at all saying that I don't still feel sad and disheartened, but I feel used to it now."" She says the numbness is a new feeling for her. ""I'm usually a very empathetic person, but right now my emotional energy is at zero. ""When the pandemic first started I was more concerned, worried and anxious at seeing the numbers rising every day. But for the past month or so, I've been feeling desensitised to the numbers.  ""I see the BBC News notification and swipe off of it."" Simone has personally experienced the impact of Covid. She had the virus herself and tragically lost a family friend to Covid. But the relentless nature of the pandemic is becoming hard to process.  ""Everyone deals with things differently, but sometimes it feels like it's just another bunch of deaths, another 5pm press conference. ""Covid has become part of our everyday lives but it shouldn't feel like that."" Like Simone, 21-year old Annie Walsh says she began feeling numb to the situation a few months ago. She's a third year student at the University of Bristol and says loads of her friends feel the same way. ""Back in March, I would check the death numbers every day thinking about how horrible it was,"" she says. ""But once it's been this many months, the numbers aren't having that kind of effect on our brains anymore - it's just like another number."" The pandemic has not only had a huge impact on Annie's studies, she lost her part-time job and both of her parents were made redundant. But she now feels desensitised to it all. ""I stopped watching the prime minister's conferences in the summer, so when I heard we'd reached 100,000 deaths, it felt hard to visualise because I hadn't been keeping up,"" she says. Struggling to digest big numbers goes back to evolutionary psychology, says Dr Meg. ""We used to live in relatively small groups and our stress response hasn't kept up with technology and understanding statistics,"" she says. She also stresses that feelings of numbness ""don't mean people don't care - in fact it's probably the opposite - people who care very deeply will find it difficult to comprehend."" One way to ""reconnect"" is to read about individual people and their stories, she says. ""Statistics are very impersonal so it's not surprising some people don't feel anything. Whereas if you were discussing a loved one who had passed away in your life, you would see tears and compassion"". Simone and Annie say that the feeling of ""numbness"" began around November, when cases started rising again. Thomas Smithurst, 26, feels the same way. ""The feeling of hopelessness started then,"" he says. ""I'm angry and it's tragic beyond words, but at the same time I feel very insignificant and helpless."" He's a teaching assistant, but hasn't been working since schools closed. ""When things started in March, I wasn't very optimistic but I never imagined it would get like this,"" he says. ""It's been going on for so long that I feel like my brain and heart have just shut down to it all."" When the prime minister announced the UK had reached 100,000 deaths, Thomas says he ""almost felt prepared for it"".  ""It didn't hit me in the way it should have,"" he says. ""I thought to myself, 'I should be more affected by this'."" Emma Carrington from Rethink Mental Illness says the charity has seen a rise in people feeling like Simone, Annie and Thomas do. ""The last year has really tested our wellbeing, with many people feeling stress, worry and uncertainty,"" she says. ""When people feel like this for long periods they may start to find it difficult to connect and empathise with other people. Compassion fatigue can be caused by burnout or feeling overwhelmed.""

Losing Mum and Dad to Covid,"By Cathy KillickBBC Look North BBC reporter Cathy Killick lost both of her parents to Covid-19 within six weeks. Her father died on 2 December and her mother on 12 January. Here is her story. I've been a reporter for the BBC for more than 30 years. In that time I've interviewed dozens of people who have experienced loss. I've done my best to convey their emotion faithfully, not having experienced it myself. Now I find I am one of those people.  I've always been struck by the bravery of those I've talked to and I've always been grateful to them too. Journalism can only exist if people are willing to share their stories, so I'm going to share mine not because I'm brave, but because I owe them. My parents' deaths came at the end of a horrible year.  They lived in a care home 10 minutes' walk from where I live in Leeds. Before Covid, I would visit them pretty much every day.  My dad, Ted, had dementia and lived on the top floor. My mum, Elizabeth, had Parkinson's and lived on the ground floor with fewer staff because she was pretty independent. She could pop up to see my dad whenever she liked.  They were happy in their care home. It was a cheerful, bustling place with a coffee bar and plenty of places to socialise. The staff were lovely too, and made an effort to get to know my parents. Whenever I visited, I saw kindness. When Covid arrived, the socialising had to stop. I saw my dad just a handful of times between March and December. I'm haunted by the thought that he felt abandoned by me and my mum. He didn't really understand anything about the virus as his dementia was quite severe. My mum, however, had the great good luck to have a room at the front of the building where I could stand on the pavement and talk to her on the phone while looking at her through her window. She called it ""swinging by"" and her face would light up when I appeared.  She was confined to her room for much of the time as her carers did everything they could to minimise the chance of infection. They did really well to keep the home Covid-free for as long as they did.  In late November, I got the call I had been dreading. My dad had tested positive.  Removing someone with dementia from their familiar surroundings can cause great distress. His GP also felt that he would not tolerate the breathing treatments on offer. Together, my brothers, sister and I decided Dad should stay at the home and receive care from the district nursing team. We were allowed to visit him individually and for short periods wearing PPE. He was very sleepy and unable to acknowledge our presence. I held his hand and told him what a great dad he'd been, not knowing if I'd ever see him again. He died 12 days after his positive test at the age of 87. My dad had had a really full life. He came from a long line of Lincolnshire farmers but stayed in the Army after doing National Service. He joined the Royal Artillery and had glamorous postings to Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Germany. He bought a caravan and took us camping on wild sites with no facilities apart from a tap. He cooked up adventures for us - mackerel fishing in a tiny rowing boat. The Army gives you friends for life and many of them wrote me such lovely letters of condolence. They talked about his kindness and lively interest in other people.  He would never describe himself as such but Dad was a feminist. He encouraged me and my sister in our careers, and taught us to face the world with courage and friendliness. He met my mother in 1955. She was a year younger and the daughter of one of his senior officers, so well used to Army life. She shared his sense of adventure. She loved bodyboarding and camping too. They had four children. But, by the 1970s, she wanted more from life than being a wife and mother. It had always rankled with her that her parents had not felt it worthwhile for girls to go to university.  So, at the age of 37, she went to college to get a teaching degree. She used her dressing table as a desk and studied at several different colleges as Army postings moved us all round the country. She became a primary school teacher and really loved her work, gaining a master's degree in children's literature.  Reading was one of the things that kept Mum going during the long months of lockdown but I could see she was losing heart. From the outside, she took Dad's death very calmly. But two days before his funeral, she had a stroke. The hospital was not allowing visitors, but they made an exception for me on compassionate grounds. My mum had lost her husband of 63 years, yet no-one had been able to give her a kiss or a hug in consolation. I was allowed to see her once to tell her about Dad's funeral.  It was painful that so few people could attend his send-off but the Royal Artillery Association sent a standard-bearer and a trumpeter to play the Last Post and represent all of his Army colleagues. It made a big difference to our sense of doing right by our father. I took some photos to show my mum in hospital. I think that visit was one of the toughest experiences of my life. My mother was so frail and so sad and I felt broken myself. Mum left hospital just before Christmas and went back to the care home to recover. She was doing well, able to walk about with her frame and we had some good chats through the window on the phone. The vaccine was starting to be rolled out and we talked about trips out and going for a drive to Almscliffe Crag - a local beauty spot she liked. Then, on one of my ""swing-bys"", Mum didn't smile when I tapped on her window. She looked dreadful and her speech was slurred. It seemed as though she was having another stroke, but after she'd arrived at hospital she tested positive for Covid. For six days, I couldn't see her. Then came the call that I could. On Covid wards, that usually only means one thing - that the patient is not expected to recover.  She could not go back to the care home because it was Covid-free, so Mum came home to me - to a hospital bed, set up in our sitting room. I am so grateful to the district nursing team, carers and night sitters who made that possible. They were outstanding and treated us all with such compassion and kindness. Those last days with Mum were intensely moving. We played her music and read her poems and tried to repay her for all the love she'd shown us over the years. Over the course of five days, her breathing slowly became more and more shallow. My siblings sat with her on FaceTime and carers came four times a day to change her position and keep her clean and comfortable. I will never forget those carers. The respect and tenderness they gave a stranger was the most humbling thing I've ever seen. For me, it transcends the misery and privations of the pandemic. It gives me something precious to hold on to and has left me with a memory of something truly beautiful.  In the weeks since, I have been on the receiving end of so much kindness and thoughtfulness. Our lovely neighbours shopped for us while we were isolating after Mum's death. Friends have left cake and gin on the doorstep. Cards, flowers and letters have cheered me up with memories of my parents. These small acts have made a big difference. Never despise these little things, or think them insignificant. They are the best of us and they are what make our current times bearable.

How will we know if the vaccine is working?,"By Maryam AhmedBBC News More than 15 million people in the UK have received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine - but how will we know if it's working?  There are some early signs of a possible vaccine effect in falling deaths among people aged over 80.  But data on cases and hospital patients is not so clear. It is hard to separate the effect of the vaccine from that of lockdown. So the government will review other data before deciding on easing restrictions. BBC News analysis, using data from England only, suggests the vaccine is starting to push the numbers down. Coronavirus deaths are falling faster for vaccinated than unvaccinated groups. On average, deaths of over-80s fell by 53% between 28 January and 11 February, compared with 44% for under-80s. This week, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, said: ""The earliest indications would imply there is some effect. ""But I think it's too early to put a number on that. ""We would expect to see some evidence that is strong enough to put into the public domain in the next few weeks."" But we're not seeing a strong vaccine effect in other statistics. Hospital admissions for over-85s dropped by 45% between 30 January and 13 February, compared with 42% for under-85s. The number of coronavirus cases is also falling slightly faster for older people compared with other age groups. Between 28 January and 11 February, cases in over-80s fell by 52% compared with 47% in under-80s. But case numbers might not be a reliable indicator of whether the vaccine is working. The vaccine prevents serious infections. But the large number of routine coronavirus tests in settings such as care homes will also pick up mild and asymptomatic infections.  When the UK eventually sees the vaccine having an effect, it will be very obvious, data from Israel suggests. Israel is the first country to see the impact of its vaccination programme. But it took significant population coverage and several weeks. It had had to vaccinate 80% of its over-60s before seeing an impact on Covid-19 cases, Prof Eran Segal, of the Weizmann Institute of Science, who is analysing data for the Israeli Ministry of Health, told BBC News. But then, there had been clear signs of the vaccine ""really helping"" to reduce numbers of cases. The biggest falls in hospital admissions and deaths had been in the over-60s, who had been vaccinated first.  And at the time, admissions had still been rising among the under-60s. So the difference between the two groups had been very clear. ""Of course it's not magic,"" Prof Segal said of realising the programme was starting to work. ""It's science. ""But it was so exciting, we thought it was a magical moment.""  In the UK, the lockdown has been reducing the numbers of admissions in all age groups. So it is harder to be sure any fall is due to vaccination.  Senior government advisers say it is very hard to be confident about the vaccination effect just by ""eyeballing"" the trends in big groups of people. And this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Although the vaccination programme is going well, we still don't have enough data about the exact effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing the spread of infection.""   But by linking vaccine records to the testing programme or GP records, government scientists can determine whether individuals who have been vaccinated are less likely to become infected or sick or pass on any infection.  And the government is reportedly reviewing data towards the end of the week in advance of Monday, when it plans to publish its plan to exit lockdown in England.

Extra 1.7m vulnerable added to Covid shielding list,"By Nick TriggleHealth correspondent There is to be a large expansion of the number of people being asked to shield in England. An extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list. Half of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs. It comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health. This calculation includes things such as ethnicity, deprivation (by postcode) and weight to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid. It also looks at age, underlying health issues and prescribed medications. Prof Andrew Hayward, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), which has been involved in the modelling, said it considered a ""combination of factors"" such as age, ethnicity and chronic illness and put them together to reach a score. He told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that this score could ""more or less order people in the population according to their level of risk"" and ""identify those at the top of that range to say, 'you should be prioritised for vaccine and you have a level of risk that is similar to those on the shielding list'"". Until now, only those with specific conditions or undergoing certain types of treatment have been advised to shield until 31 March. They include adults with Down's Syndrome, organ donor recipients and people with severe respiratory conditions. The new model was developed following work by Oxford University which looked at the characteristics of people who died in the first wave to better understand risk. Medical records have been searched to identify high-risk patients, based on their combined risk factors.  They are now being sent letters by the NHS informing of them of their new status, which means they are entitled to statutory sick pay, prioritisation for online shopping slots and help collecting medicines. Some local authorities with areas of high deprivation will now have a major task in contacting people to check what support they need, according to the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym. Cllr Neil Nerva, public health lead at Brent Council, in north-west London, told BBC News: ""We've got 17,000 people who are shielding. The news today means that over the next two weeks we're going to be shielding another 12,000 people who are over 70 and another 12,000 who are under 70."" He added: ""That, I think, shows in very graphic terms the health inequalities which exist in a borough like Brent."" Have you been added to the shielding list? You can get in touch with us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist. You can also get in touch in the following ways: Of the 1.7 million people newly added to the list, around 900,000 have already received an offer of a vaccination because they were over 70. The remainder are all thought to fall into one of the priority groups for vaccination that are being invited for vaccination next. They will be bumped up the list first for a jab, the government said. It means they will receive the offer a few weeks later than if they had been in the shielding group originally. Shielding was re-introduced in tier four areas from mid-December, before being expanded nationally once the third lockdown was announced in early January. Unlike in the first lockdown, people who are shielding are being advised they can leave their homes for exercise. Government guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or to attend a medical appointment.   They should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within their household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. People on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine. High risk categories include:  The list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing. England's deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""All of these people who are identified for the first time, are those who have not had an individual clinical condition that we've previously been able to identify through the clinically extremely vulnerable group, but they are people who have multiple personal risk factors and underlying health conditions which move them into a higher risk group."" She said adding people to the shielding list ensured ""those most vulnerable to Covid can benefit from both the protection that vaccines provide and from enhanced advice and support should they choose it"". The approach was ""risk averse"" to ""protect as many people as possible"", she added. Phillip Anderson, of the MS Society, said some people with multiple sclerosis were being added to the shielding list. He said it would come as a ""huge shock"" to people who would potentially have to make ""drastic changes"" to their lives. The Westminster government said the model had been shared with the other nations of the UK, who would decide individually how to use it. There are no current plans to formally expand the shielding list in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the same way as in England. The Welsh government said the same computer model had already been used to add those with chronic kidney disease and adults with Down's Syndrome to its list of those who are extremely clinically vulnerable. In Northern Ireland, GPs and hospital doctors can add individual patients to the shielding list if they are assessed as extremely vulnerable based on a range of factors.

Dutch crisis as court orders end to Covid curfew,"A court in The Hague has told the Dutch government that an overnight curfew to reduce the spread of coronavirus should be lifted, ruling that it breaches the right to free movement. The court said the 21:00 to 04:30 curfew was imposed by an emergency law when there was no ""acute emergency"". Later, a higher court ruled that the curfew could stay in place pending an appeal on Friday. The curfew, imposed in January, led to rioting in several Dutch cities. Police were patrolling streets near the Dutch parliament on Tuesday evening but no unrest has been reported so far. The earlier court ruling - which said the curfew should be lifted immediately - was a victory for campaign group Viruswaarheid (Virus Truth) and a major upset for the government. The government quickly asked for the decision to be suspended until an appeal was heard at the end of the week. An appeals court later granted that suspension. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Mark Rutte described the ruling against the curfew as a setback and urged people to continue to follow the restrictions, which he said were ""simply necessary"". The Dutch cabinet is urgently working on a new law to enforce the curfew, but that could take time. Curfews have been widely used in Europe to restrict movement. France has had a nightly curfew from 18:00 but has stopped short of imposing a third lockdown. Greece has also imposed curfews, as have Spain and Italy. The Dutch measure, which came into force on 23 January, was intended to reduce movement, particularly among young people, but triggered days of rioting in a number of towns and cities. The Netherlands had not seen a curfew since Nazi occupation in World War Two. Although the Netherlands initially avoided strict measures, a lockdown was brought in last December and, after the cabinet decided on a curfew in January, MPs backed it days later amid fears that the UK, or Kent, variant would increase infections. The government resigned before last month's curfew decision and now has a caretaker role ahead of elections next month. Infection rates were slightly down on Tuesday, with 2,735 new cases reported in the past 24 hours. But hospital admissions were up and 88 more deaths were reported. Some 629,000 people have received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose since vaccinations began in the Netherlands on 6 January, and of those around one in four have had a second dose. In their ruling on Tuesday, the Dutch judges said the curfew had been imposed under an emergency law, even though the court said there was no emergency as in the case of a ""dyke being breached"".  Fears of increased infection because of the UK variant were not valid as no curfew was imposed last year when pressure on Dutch hospitals was far greater, the judges said. The curfew was therefore a violation of the right to freedom of movement and privacy, and limited the right to freedom of assembly.  Commentators spoke of ministers having faced a ""Catch-22"" situation. When the cabinet decided on the curfew they sought the backing of MPs, but by waiting for parliamentary support, in the judges eyes they had disproved the need for emergency legislation. The case threatened to descend into farce during the afternoon, when Virus Truth spokesman Jeroen Pols accused the lead judge of bias for allowing the government to challenge the court's ruling so quickly. Even the group that brought the case to court, Virus Truth, seemed surprised by its success. I recently interviewed its Covid-sceptic founder, Willem Engel, in his Rotterdam dance studio. He and his followers are adamant governments around the world are using efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 as a guise to gain control of citizens. This ruling has emboldened them.  The curfew has been one of the most controversial and contested elements of the Dutch lockdown but the majority of the population had accepted and abided by it.  Some people have started planning ""after-curfew"" parties, though other rules, such as no more than one guest at home a day and a ban on gatherings of more than two people outdoors, remain in place.  While this court victory specifically relates to the Dutch situation, it could be used as a precedent by anti-lockdown groups seeking to overturn Covid-related rules in other countries too.

Covid variant surge testing expanded to more areas,"Surge testing for the South African variant of Covid-19 is being expanded in several areas across England. The tests will take place in areas of Norfolk, Southampton and Surrey. Surge testing for a mutation of the Kent variant will also expand in Manchester. People in the latest targeted areas should take a test this week whether they are showing symptoms or not, the Department of Health (DoH) said. Surge testing for the South African variant began on 1 February. At that stage, residents across Surrey, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Southport and Walsall were asked to take tests, regardless of symptoms. The DoH said additional surge testing and genomic sequencing would now be deployed to the following postcode areas: A government spokeswoman said people with symptoms should book a test in the normal way, while those without symptoms should visit their local authority website for more information. Surge testing is the roll-out of additional community testing to help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic cases and prompting people to self-isolate. Positive cases will be sequenced for genomic data to help scientists and public health officials understand the variant and its spread. The DoH said surge testing in parts of the London boroughs of Haringey and Merton, along with Sefton in Merseyside, were complete. ""Further data on surge testing will be provided in due course,"" a spokeswoman said.  Residents tell of fear amid Covid variant testing 'Do I need a Covid community surge test?'

Business rates relief to be extended for full year,"Scottish retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation businesses will not pay non-domestic rates throughout the next financial year, under plans announced by Finance Secretary Kate Forbes. The extension comes after a further Â£1.1bn of coronavirus support funding was promised by the UK Treasury. The Federation of Small Businesses said it would help smaller firms survive. The extension was also welcomed by opposition MSPs, who said they had been calling for such a move. Ms Forbes had already announced plans for a three-month extension to non-domestic rates relief in her budget last month. In a statement to MSPs, she said this would now be extended to the full financial year 2021/22. ""When I presented the budget last month I was clear that if resources allowed I would extend 100% non-domestic rates relief for properties in the retail, hospitality, leisure and aviation sectors for all of next year,"" she said. ""I am now in a position to provide that certainty to business, meeting the number one ask of the business community and demonstrating our commitment to supporting the economy."" The rates relief will also apply to newspaper offices, which were removed from the initial list but have now been reinstated following lobbying from the sector and political pressure. Independent schools, which were to lose charitable rates relief from April, have had that postponed again, keeping the rates relief until 2022. The plans for the additional Â£1.1bn in funding announced by the Treasury also include: In addition, councils will receive an extra Â£275m in the current financial year to address Covid pressures, and Â£40m is being made available to support the safe reopening of schools. The Scottish government currently does not hold enough votes to pass its budget at Holyrood and is negotiating with other parties in an effort to secure support. Conservative MSP Murdo Fraser said his party had ""repeatedly demanded"" the extension to rates relief, which would give businesses ""some welcome breathing space"". However, he questioned whether business support funds were reaching firms that are ""teetering on the edge"". Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also welcomed the move, which she said had been ""a key ask"" for her party. But she said the eligibility criteria for business support was ""too tight"", and that an increase in funding for mental health ""falls well short of what is required"". Andrew McRae, Scotland policy chairman for the Federation of Small Businesses, said extending rate relief would ""allow many more smaller firms to make it through to the end of this crisis and help them get back on their feet when the economy re-opens"". He said that if larger firms return the savings from the relief, as some major supermarkets have done, this money should be used to give local businesses a ""shot in the arm"". David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said: ""This is a bold and significant move and a vital shot in the arm for the sector, much of which remains closed and faces an uncertain future."" The Scottish Licensed Trade Association said it was a ""much-needed lifeline"" for the sector.

SA coronavirus variant now 'dominant' in Zimbabwe,"Zimbabwe says the coronavirus variant first discovered in neighbouring South Africa now makes up more than 60% of cases within its borders.  It is the first country outside of South Africa to report that the so-called ""501.YV2"" variant is the dominant strain. Botswana, Zambia, Ghana and the Gambia have also found some cases. The announcement by Zimbabwe's government comes a day after a national lockdown was extended by two weeks. Monday saw the delivery of 200,000 Sinopharm vaccines doses donated by China, with rollout set to begin on Thursday.

As reported by Reuters news agency this month, a small-scale study by Sinopharm researchers found that its efficacy against this variant was weaker than against the original virus. Zimbabwe is expected to receive another 600,000 doses in March. The BBC's Shingai Nyoka in Harare says coronavirus cases are on the decline, but Zimbabwe's 4% fatality rate has the authorities worried. Since the pandemic began, Zimbabwe has recorded more than 35,000 coronavirus cases, including 1,410 deaths. South Africa, meanwhile, is offering all of its doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to the African Union for distribution elsewhere on the continent, after a small-scale study suggested it had limited efficacy against the variant in the country. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said it was ""disappointing"" but added South Africa was ""determined not to be derailed from our commitment to roll out vaccines in February"".  South Africa has now secured a total of nine million doses of Johnson & Johnson's yet-to-be-approved vaccine, with a first consignment arriving on Tuesday.

Family reunited after hotel quarantine 'error',"An eight-year-old girl and her father, wrongly quarantined under Scotland's new hotel isolation rules, have been reunited with the girl's mother after just one day in the UK. Chun Wong and his daughter Kiernan got the hugs they were desperate for with his wife Danielle on Tuesday after immigration delays kept them apart for 16 months. They were allowed to leave their hotel after an error was discovered.  They will now isolate at home in Fife. Since Monday, all passengers arriving in Scotland on international flights have to enter ""managed isolation"".  However, this does not apply to those coming from within the Common Travel Area, including the UK and Ireland. Mr Wong and Kiernan had arrived in Edinburgh from the US via Dublin. They had gone straight to a hotel at Edinburgh airport, following advice they had been given. Later that night they were told that as they had got a connecting flight from Ireland, they could instead isolate at home.  The family was finally reunited on Tuesday afternoon. Mrs Wong told BBC Scotland about the moment she got to hug Kiernan for the first time in more than a year. She said: ""I have never had that level of anxiety on my life. My legs were shaking so much and when she came out of the hotel she was scared to run to me. It was lovely and I didn't want to let her go."" Mr Wong added: ""I just told her to run to mummy. What a reunion to remember."" He said an official from the airport had come to see him in the hotel on Monday night.  ""He said that it was an error on their part that since we came into the country through Dublin we didn't need to quarantine,"" he said. ""They were very apologetic. They said they screwed up, which I understand. It was day one and what process is perfect on day one?"" The new arrivals will still carry out self-testing on the second and eighth day, in line with the isolation rules. Travellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay Â£1,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests. In Mr Wong's case that was a further Â£325 for Kiernan. The Scottish government said it was investigating why he was ""wrongly advised"" at the airport. But Mrs Wong said she had found it difficult to get the right information ahead of her family's arrival. She said: ""We believed because they came from the US and the Scottish rule says that is international travel regardless of whether it is a red list country or not, they have to quarantine."" She was advised to book a quarantine hotel but again found problems with the England-based system. She said that online forms had no prompts for Scotland.  She added: ""It is confusing. I believe based on the regulations they should be at the hotel. I don't disagree with the stance Scotland is taking.  ""We were willing and happy to do it. It's an appropriate measure but it needs to be made simpler for people coming here.  ""I didn't expect this. But I am thankful because I get to see my daughter. I was frantically running to the shops this morning to stock up on food."" Mr Wong and Kiernan have moved to Scotland to be with Mrs Wong who has been in the country since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line NHS worker, involved in addiction services. The family have been separated for 16 months, after the pandemic hit the immigration system. On Monday Mr Wong said it would be ""heartbreaking"" to be apart for another 10 days if they had to isolate in a hotel. He said his daughter was ""ecstatic, overjoyed and a little nervous"" as it had been more than a year since she had seen her mum. ""The last time she saw her she was seven and in April she'll be nine. Crazy."" On Tuesday Kiernan had two Christmases' worth of presents waiting for her at her new home. A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We are looking into the circumstances that led to Mr Wong being wrongly advised at the airport that he needed to book a managed isolation package. This is a very new system, being implemented at pace, and some initial challenges are to be expected.   ""We are following up with the travel management company to ensure a full refund is provided to Mr Wong."" An Edinburgh Airport spokesman wished the Wong family well as they settled into their new life in Scotland. However, he insisted that ""inaccurate advice"" had come from the government which was evidence of the ""confusion"" the policy had created.  The spokesman added: ""It is a clear example of the loophole that our governments have created in action and they should work together to close it before this happens again."" All those arriving into Scotland directly from outside the Common Travel Area must pay to isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel. But Scotland's first minister has raised concerns about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals elsewhere, then travel to Scotland on public transport. For example, in England only travellers from 33 ""red list"" countries must enter managed quarantine. UK minister Nadhim Zahawi claimed on Tuesday that the quarantine rollout had ""gone smoothly"" in England. Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""As for day one, it's gone reasonably well, we can always do better and, of course, work with Scotland."" He added: ""Our discussions with the Scottish government will lead to a better operating system. I think it would be unwise to close the border, we are one United Kingdom."" The guidelines for international travel are published on the Scottish government website.  A section of it says: ""You must also book and pay for managed isolation if you travel to Scotland from the Republic of Ireland, and have been in an acute risk country (a ""red list"" country) in the 10 days before your arrival. ""If you arrive in Scotland from within the Common Travel Area, but have been in a country not on the acute risk list in the 10 days before your arrival, you must self-isolate. ""There are some limited exemptions from isolation. You may still be required to self-isolate when you are not doing the essential activity the exemption allows.""

NY governor: My ‘mistake’ hiding care home deaths,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has accepted blame - but has not apologised - for a lack of transparency about Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes. More than 15,000 New Yorkers in care homes have died since the start of the pandemic. But - until late last month - the state's health department had logged just over 8,500 fatalities. The governor confirmed the discrepancy in a press conference on Monday. The initial undercount was partly the result of a controversial policy to exclude residents that died outside of the facilities, including in hospital, from the official numbers, according to a report. Since the report came out over two weeks ago, the state has added thousands more deaths to its official tally, more accurately reflecting the true death toll of nursing home residents. Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, has repeatedly defended his handling of nursing homes, often arguing that other states were doing far worse, but his administration has been engulfed by the scandal in recent days. Last week, in a private conversation leaked to the New York Post, a top aide to Mr Cuomo confessed to covering up the real numbers and withholding the information out of concern the data ""was going to be used against us"". On Monday, Mr Cuomo - who has brushed aside criticism for months - acknowledged ""a delay"" in the reporting of some nursing home deaths. Calling it a ""mistake"", he conceded that the failure to answer questions from state lawmakers and the news media had created a void ""filled with scepticism, and cynicism, and conspiracy theories which furthered the confusion"". ""I take responsibility for that,"" he said. ""Total death counts were always accurate, nothing was hidden from anyone, but we did create the void. And that created pain. And I feel very badly about that."" When asked if he would say sorry, however, Mr Cuomo hesitated: ""Apologise? Look, I have said repeatedly we made a mistake in creating the void."" ""We should have provided more information faster,"" he explained, but his staff was ""too focused on doing the job and addressing the crisis of the moment"". Lawmakers from both parties have called for an investigation into the Cuomo administration. As the coronavirus pandemic was unfolding across the US and New York City was in a public health crisis, Governor Andrew Cuomo presented himself as the cool-headed counterpart to President Donald Trump.  He was taking the threat seriously, not making excuses or engaging in wishful thinking. He was relying on science, not on untested, and unreliable miracle cures. There was talk among Democrats, for a while, of drafting Cuomo to be the presidential nominee, or at least Joe Biden's running mate. Almost a year on, however, and the lustre is starting to fade from Cuomo's star.  The state is struggling with when, and how, to reopen in the face of new health threats. And, as is often the case with political scandals, his greatest trouble is as much about the cover-up as the original act. In this case, Cuomo's administration withheld information about the number of nursing home deaths in the state to deflect attention away from the decisions made regarding the handling and treatment of elderly with Covid-19. He may have avoided giving politically damaging information to Trump and federal investigators, but he may now find himself in greater danger than if he had been forthcoming at the time.

How will the phased return to school work?,"By Jamie McIvorBBC Scotland education correspondent Scotland's schools will open up to more pupils later this month, as part of plans for a phased reopening.  All pupils in P1-P3 and pre-school children can return to the classroom full-time from 22 February.  There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. Here are the answers to some of the questions you may have about how the return to the classroom will work.  One reason for this is the concern that younger children potentially lose out the most from so-called remote learning. The government still feels that a full return of primary pupils is not possible, and the younger classes are being prioritised. Of course some older children are still in primary school buildings because their parents are key workers or because they are deemed vulnerable. Older pupils will only be able to return after 22 February to ensure practical work important to achieving qualifications is completed - but the definition of practical work isn't prescriptive.  It is designed to cover the kind of work which cannot be done from home - notably in practical and vocational subjects. It might include work in practical subjects such as art or woodwork. It might also include laboratory work in science subjects. However, the work does not need to be related to the assessments teachers will be carrying out to estimate grades for those who should have sat exams. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hopes to set out the second phase of school re-opening on 2 March. However, she said it was unlikely that there will be any further return to school before 15 March. The key thing will be whether community transmission is under control or not. It is worth watching the daily case numbers to see if they continue to fall. The likelihood is that any decisions on the return will be taken on a Scotland-wide basis. Teachers have until the middle of June to submit estimated grades. They need to be signed off by headteachers. The presumption is that candidates will get these grades in August unless the SQA has any cause to question them. There will be no algorithm so a school's previous record should not lead to a candidate's grades being revised up or down.  Detailed guidance on just what sort of evidence teachers need to gather to justify their estimates has been published by the SQA. The evidence will be needed should grades be queried. Often this could involve what are, in effect, class tests using the kind of questions normally set in exams. The government says the National Qualifications 2021 Group will publish further details soon on how qualifications will be awarded in a way which fairly reflects pupils' experience of remote learning. This could depend on just when secondary pupils may be back in full-time. However, it is worth noting that after Easter, students are often on study leave or consolidating their courses. With no exams - and the June deadline for estimates - this time may be used to actually finish off the courses. It certainly won't have a direct impact or set a precedent. The decision will be taken by the Scottish government and it will be driven purely by the data for Scotland. However, as a general rule, case numbers in Scotland are lower than in England. How might parents might react if older primary children and early secondary students returned earlier in England than Scotland, even if case numbers south of the border are higher? One challenge for politicians is to try to weigh up whether there is public support for ongoing restrictions and whether the public believes their benefit balances out the harm they cause to so many areas of life.  So far, improving case numbers north and south of the border are largely down to lockdown restrictions. Once the impact of the vaccination programme is clearer - especially if, as expected, it substantially cuts deaths and hospital admissions - it will be interesting to see if public attitudes change.

Nine more Covid-19 related deaths recorded in NI,"Nine more Covid-19 deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland according to the latest figures from the Department of Health. A further 341 more people tested positive for the virus over the last 24 hours. The Covid-19 related death total is now 2,009, after reaching a milestone figure of 2,000 on Monday. Meanwhile almost 450,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine have been administered.  The total number of deaths has doubled since December, after reaching 1,000 over two months ago.  There are currently 474 Covid inpatients in NI hospitals of which 55 are being treated in intensive care. There are 64 care home outbreaks. In the Republic of Ireland, a further 33 coronavirus-linked deaths and 744 cases were confirmed on Tuesday, taking the country's total to 3,980. There are 861 inpatients with coronavirus in hospitals there, of which 159 are in intensive care.  As Northern Ireland continues to roll out its vaccination programme, it has emerged that nearly a quarter of those people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) and who are under the age of 65 have received the vaccine so far - more than 18,500 people.  As of Monday 409,507 people had received their first dose, 29,201 of whom had received their second, meaning a total of 438,708 doses had been administered, including: The exact number of people who fall into the CEV category in Northern Ireland is not clear.  Department of Health figures suggest a total of 95,000 people are classed as extremely vulnerable., but it is not known how many of those would already have been vaccinated because of their age. Those on the CEV list include:  People who received a shielding letter because they are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable can now book vaccinations over the phone, after an online booking system went live on Friday. It comes as it was announced that 1.7m extra people in England will be asked to shield, after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health. These people will not be made a priority for vaccination. The model has been shared with the devolved administrations, including Stormont, with it as yet unclear as to whether they will make any changes.  Northern Ireland's Executive is set to review current lockdown restrictions - which saw schools and non-essential shops closed on 26 December - on Thursday.  It is thought unlikely restrictions on shops, restaurants and non-essential services will be eased before April, although there have been suggestions some schools may reopen in March. Officials say with St Patrick's Day and the Easter holidays around the corner, they do not want to prematurely allow more opportunities for people to mix, which would likely lead to another rise in cases. BBC News NI is keen to hear your questions about coronavirus following the executive meeting on Thursday to review restrictions.

Priest providing 'takeaway ashes' for Ash Wednesday,"A priest in the Republic of Ireland has made ""takeaway ashes"" available for parishioners to administer at home on Ash Wednesday. Fr Brian Brady teamed up with a shop in Clonmany, County Donegal, to provide holy ashes in sauce containers. Covid-19 restrictions in the country mean all church services must be conducted online.  He told BBC News NI that he has been overwhelmed by the response. All 600 portions of ashes have been taken away. ""It's a new experience formed to have people wanting to talk to me,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""There's been a lot of attention and people want more ashes but can't get them."" The priest said it was ""a nice feeling"" that this initiative had meant something to people. ""A lot of our parishioners would come every year for their ashes and it's so important that we honour those traditions - even at these most difficult times,""  he said. ""We really did have to stretch the old imagination on this one though."" More than 600 containers have already been distributed for the holy day. The containers are limited to one per household and they also include a prayer service for use in the home prepared by Fr Brady. Instructions about how to apply ashes are on the sheet. ""The advice is to moisten them, but to be careful not to moisten too much as they'll run down your forehead and nose as has happened to many a poor soul in the past,"" Fr Brady said. Staff at the local Centra have being helping make up the containers, which are usually for sauces. They have been using burnt palms from Palm Sunday which have been blessed and left out for collection at the three churches in the parish. Ash Wednesday marks the first day of Lent, a season of reflection and preparation before Easter. Catholics traditionally attend a Mass at which their foreheads are marked with ash in the shape of a cross. By observing the 40 days of Lent, Christians replicate Jesus Christ's sacrifice and withdrawal into the desert for 40 days. The period of reflection is marked by fasting, both from food and festivities. Shop owner Joe Joyce said he could not believe how popular the takeaway ashes have been, and he's also blown away by the amount of media attention they were getting. Staff have been working on more containers to help meet the demand, he told BBC News NI.  ""There is a huge community spirit here in Clonmany, and this is just another thing the village has got behind during these tough times,"" he said. ""Through our local community group, Clonmany Together, people have helped deliver groceries, they've delivered medicines, they've done online bingo and now this.  ""It's just another simple gesture that people here wanted to do for others."" Meanwhile Fr Brady confesses that he got ""a bit of ribbing from some of his priest friends about takeaway ashes"". ""But I would hope if priests thought it was worthwhile, they would go with it,"" he said. The bishop too is on side. ""He seems to be pleased that an effort has been made to enable this important tradition to continue,"" said Fr Brady. The Clonmany parish includes St Mary's in Clonmany, St Michael's in Urris and the Oratory of the Assumption, Ballyliffin.

Rapid tests and vaccines 'will help venues reopen',"A combination of rapid testing and the Covid vaccination programme will help entertainment venues to reopen in England, the vaccines minister says. Nadhim Zahawi said it was those measures which would get ""our economy back on its feet"". His comments come after the PM said ""rapid"" lateral flow tests could be used by ""those parts of the economy we couldn't get open last year"". Industry bosses have queried whether using rapid tests would be practical.  Some venues such as nightclubs have been unable to open since March 2020, while others like theatres and cinemas have struggled to make social distancing work. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Zahawi said: ""It's a combination of rapid testing as well as a national vaccination programme that will get our economy back on its feet and venues open again."" He said that the government favoured testing over vaccine passports as a means to reopening the economy, since it was not yet clear whether a vaccinated individual could still transmit the virus. Mr Zahawi described preliminary evidence on the effect of vaccines on coronavirus transmission as ""really encouraging"", but said the full data might not be available for weeks. ""We have a couple of very large-scale studies related to giving us better data on the vaccines,"" he said. ""We should be able to see really good data in the next few weeks from those studies."" He added that the government would be ""data driven, rather than date driven"" when it comes to relaxing lockdown measures.  Boris Johnson is due to set out a road map on 22 February for easing the lockdown in England. At Monday's Downing Street briefing, the prime minister said lateral flow tests, along with vaccination, would ""probably be the route forward"" to reopening the economy. Lateral flow tests give a result in 20-30 minutes - unlike the more expensive PCR tests used by NHS Test and Trace which need to be taken to a lab to be processed. The UK Cinema Association said asking all customers to have a rapid test and then to wait 30 minutes for a result would be ""impractical"" and in many instances add a ""50% uplift on their cinema ticket"". Its chief executive, Phil Clapp, said he was not aware of any of its members considering rapid testing or vaccine passports ""as a viable way forward for the return to cinema"". He added that he believed cinemas offered a ""materially different environment than nightclubs or music venues"". Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of trade association UKHospitality, said the organisation would be ""keen to understand"" the government's plans for mass lateral flow testing in the community and workplaces. She also said the industry body stood ready to work with ministers on ""a risk-assessed approach to be applied on a voluntary basis where proportionate, pragmatic and necessary"". Michael Kill, the boss of the Night Time Industries Association, welcomed the PM's comments, saying: ""Finally we have some acknowledgement from the prime minister and government on the existence of late-night economy businesses, including nightclubs, theatres, casinos and late bars, particularly as they are some of the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic."" However, he told the BBC that administering rapid tests would not be straightforward. He said professionals would be required to administer swab tests outside the venue, which would force venues to stagger admissions and have procedures in place to deal with positive cases and those who they came into contact with. Sacha Lord, who co-founded Manchester's Parklife Festival, said the events sector had been calling for on-site rapid testing for more than five months, and any further delay to implementing such initiatives would do ""irreversible"" damage to the UK's cultural sector.  ""My fear is that they take another five months to get moving, which the industry simply doesn't have,"" he said. The UK recorded a further 10,625 new infections on Tuesday, down 14% from 12,364 last Tuesday. There were also another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - down 24% from 1,052 last Tuesday.  Meanwhile, people arriving in England who are required to quarantine in a hotel face an additional Â£1,200 bill if they test positive for coronavirus, the government has said.This is on top of the Â£1,750 cost for the entering the quarantine hotel programme and will apply to guests forced to extend their stay beyond the initial 11 nights.  The information was published on the government's website on Monday, the day the new rules came into force for arrivals who have been in a high-risk Covid country. West Midlands Police have fined four passengers Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country.

""He played a big part in co-ordinating theatre supplies across the surgical division and will be remembered for his diligence and loyalty. ""Dave was a great example of what we stand for in this trust"", she added. Mrs Morgan said the family was ""truly devastated"" by their sudden loss.

"Covid deaths pass 7,000 mark in Wales","The number of deaths involving Covid-19 in the pandemic has passed the 7,000 mark in Wales. But the number of weekly deaths has fallen for a third successive week, according to latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 314 deaths involving Covid-19 in the week ending 5 February, accounting for 34.8% of all deaths, compared with 37.1% the week before. It takes the total to 7,089 since March last year. The most deaths were again in north Wales with 73 deaths in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area. Fifty of these were in hospitals and 20 in care homes. Of these, 45 were in Wrexham and Flintshire, which have been the hotspots for Covid cases in Wales in recent weeks. There were also 65 deaths in the Cardiff and Vale area. The number of deaths also rose to 17 in Powys, its highest weekly number since the first wave of the pandemic. Elsewhere, the number of weekly deaths fell. In total in Wales, this meant a drop from 361 deaths the week before. It takes the total of deaths in the pandemic where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate to 7,005 up to 5 February. This is nearly a fifth of all deaths over the period. When deaths occurring up to 5 February but registered in the week or so after are included, the total is 7,089. The figures also show the peak in the second wave of the pandemic came on 11 January, when there were 81 deaths in Wales. This is even higher than the peak of the first wave, which happened on 12 April, when there were 73 deaths involving Covid-19. The ONS estimates Covid is the underlying cause of death in 90% of those when it is mentioned on certificates by doctors. Unlike Public Health Wales, which gives a daily snapshot of deaths, the ONS also includes cases where Covid is both suspected or confirmed. It also covers deaths not only in hospitals, but all care homes and also hospices and people's homes. The ONS figures cover 65 deaths involving care home residents, including 10 in both Carmarthenshire and Wrexham. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 974 to 903 in the week, but it was still 143 deaths (18.8%) above the five-year average. Rhondda Cynon Taf has had most Covid-19 deaths in Wales over the course of the pandemic - 838 so far. Looking at the crude mortality rate - which takes into account population sizes - it also has the fourth highest across England and Wales with 347.3 deaths per 100,000. Merthyr Tydfil (328.2) and Bridgend (324.4) also feature in the highest 10 areas.

Youngest pupils to return to Scotland's classrooms,"The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week. The move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest. All other existing lockdown measures will all remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position.  The EIS teaching union said it still had significant concerns over school safety which had not yet been addressed, and a blended learning model - with around half of pupils in classes at any one time - would have more appropriate.  The union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: ""Everyone is supportive of face-to-face teaching returning as soon as possible - that should not override safety concerns, however, and teachers will be understandably nervous around today's announcement."" The Scottish government will draw up a ""revised strategic framework"" - to be published next week - to set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased. Will your child be returning to school on Monday?  Share your stories.  Ms Sturgeon said it was unlikely that hotels and holiday accommodation would be open again in time for people to book any sort of Easter break, but ""staycations"" may be possible by summer. In an update at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""more reason to be hopeful now than we did a few weeks ago"" that the race against the virus could be won, with the vaccination programme picking up pace while lockdown contains the spread of new cases. She said she was ""very hopeful that vaccination will start to have a significant impact in reducing the number of people who die from Covid"", saying there was already evidence of this in care homes. However, the first minister warned that ""our situation is still very fragile"", saying: ""Even a slight easing of restrictions could cause cases to start rising rapidly again"". While she said it would continue to be ""extremely cautious"", the government is focused on a ""gradual, phased return to as much normality as possible"". This is to begin with schools, with the youngest pupils to return to classrooms as soon as next week. But Ms Sturgeon said there would be trade-offs, adding: ""We are choosing to use the very limited headroom we have right now to get at least some children back to school - because children's education and wellbeing is such a priority. ""But being able to get children back to education may mean the rest of us living with some other restrictions for longer."" Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March.  Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year.  A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week. But expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year. The first pupils to return to schools will be those in preschools, those in P1, P2 and P3, and ""a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work"". Ministers hope to set out second phase of schools reopening in two weeks time, but Ms Sturgeon said there was ""unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March"" so that the impact of the initial changes can be assessed. She said at-home testing sets would be provided to senior phase pupils, teachers and school staff once they do return, and that secondary pupils would have to maintain a 2m distance in school buildings. Plans for the ""gradual"" easing of the strict stay at home lockdown are set to include a return to a regional levels system. Ms Sturgeon said that ""caution will be necessary"", and that she would be clear about what will not be possible in the immediate future - including holidays. She said: ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels of self-catering accommodation by then. ""However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said it was ""very welcome news"" that schools could start opening again safely. However she said that ""to get us even closer to normality, we need to get all key workers vaccinated as early as we can"", saying government plans were ""short on detail"". And she urged the Scottish government to publish its plans for helping pupils to catch-up with the schooling they have missed, which she said should be built around a tutoring service to stop the attainment gap growing.  Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also challenged Ms Sturgeon over the vaccine rollout, urging the first minister to commit to more ambitious targets for completing priority groups.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56087581,1
Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. The number of people being asked to shield in England is to be expanded, the government has announced. An extra 1.7 million people are expected to be added to the 2.3 million already on the list. Half of the group have not yet been vaccinated so will now be prioritised urgently by their local GPs. It comes after a new model was developed that takes into account extra factors rather than just health, including ethnicity, deprivation and weight, to work out a person's risk of becoming seriously ill if they were to catch Covid. The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week. The move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest, while all other lockdown measures will remain in place until at least the end of this month. You can read more about the plans for reopening schools across the UK here. England's vaccination programme is starting to pay off, with the over-80s age group now the most likely to test positive for coronavirus antibodies, Office for National Statistics testing suggests. Blood tests reveal that more over-80s than any other age group in England are showing signs of some immunity against Covid infection. Previously, younger age groups who were more likely to be exposed to the virus were the most likely to test positive for antibodies. It comes as Covid deaths have fallen - although overall, deaths are still 40% above the five-year average. Four air passengers have each been fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country, West Midlands Police has said. They were stopped at border control by officials and were not able to leave Birmingham Airport. Under new rules in force since Monday, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels if they have been in one of 33 countries deemed a high Covid risk within the last 10 days.  Within weeks, Cuba's domestically-produced Covid-19 vaccine, Soberana 2, will be tested on tens of thousands of volunteers, with the government hoping to give the jab to everyone on the island by the end of the year. It is an ambitious goal but a realistic one as Cuba has more than 30 years of experience in biotechnology and immunology, including producing the first meningitis B vaccine in the late 1980s. The BBC's Will Grant has been finding out more about how Cuba hopes to become the first Latin American country to produce its own coronavirus jab.

FM urges Scots not to book Easter holidays,"Nicola Sturgeon has warned Scots not to book Easter holidays as it is ""highly unlikely"" that hotels or self catering accommodation will be open. The first minister advised against booking a break either overseas or in Scotland at the start of April. She also said it was unlikely that overseas holidays would be possible in the summer. However, she said ""staycations"" might be possible - although it would depend on the Covid data nearer the time. Giving her Covid update statement to MSPs at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said the risks posed by new variants of the virus meant it was ""hard to overstate the necessity of being careful, cautious and gradual as we exit this lockdown"". She said that meant continuing to abide by the ""stay-at-home"" requirement. The Scottish government hopes to publish a ""revised strategic framework"" next week which will set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased. ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels or self catering accommodation by then,"" said the first minister. ""However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time."" Ms Sturgeon said she had always made it clear that education should be the priority. She confirmed that the youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week, along with some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, and are unlikely to return to school until at least 15 March. All other existing lockdown measures will remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. Marc Crothall, chief executive of the Scottish Tourism Alliance (STA), said the first minister's statement had made tourism businesses ""extremely anxious"". He said the STA Board would meet Ms Sturgeon in the coming weeks and update her on the ""desperate state"" the industry is in.  ""I know of numerous businesses who are wholly reliant on being able to trade again at Easter in order to stay solvent,"" Mr Crothall said. ""Today's indication that this is highly unlikely will, I know, serve as a crushing blow to many."" He called for more support if businesses are not going to be able to trade viably for months to come.

When can I stop shielding? And other questions,"At least 15 million people have now been vaccinated against coronavirus in the UK. Here are some of your latest questions on vaccination, and other Covid-related matters:  The shielding advice remains unchanged at the moment, even for those who have received both doses of the vaccine. The government is keeping the situation under review. In addition, another 1.7 million clinically vulnerable people have been asked to shield in England. Shielding has never been compulsory, but is strongly recommended to protect lives. People shielding are advised to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or attend a medical appointment, and keep all contact with others to a minimum and avoid busy areas. You should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within your household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. Lockdown has helped get coronavirus cases down in the community, which reduces the risk of people coming into contact with the virus. But social distancing measures are still advised for everyone.  Even those who have been vaccinated should continue to use face coverings, regularly wash their hands and keep their distance from others to help prevent the spread of Covid.  No vaccine is 100% protective and immunisation will not stop all spread of the virus. Having the vaccine cuts a personâs chance of getting ill if they do catch it.  Although people of any age can experience symptoms if they catch coronavirus, people in older age groups, as well as those with underlying health conditions, are at higher risk of getting severely ill. This is why they are being offered the vaccine first. Itâs estimated about one in 10 people who fall ill with covid remain unwell two months after being infected. Long covid can last from weeks to many months.  Some people who were infected towards the beginning of the pandemic still have long covid now. Others have since recovered.  The symptoms of long covid are varied and can fluctuate. Doctors are learning more about the condition, including the  symptoms that people may experience and how long these can last for. Vaccine deliveries are increasing, but some doses will be reserved for people who need their second âboosterâ shot.  The government says it is confident that there will be enough supplies to meet the ambition to vaccinate all people over the age of 50, as well as unpaid carers and people of any age with underlying health conditions, by the end of April. Yes, you will be able to do that. The whole of England, and most areas of the UK are 
                        currently under lockdown and people should stay at home. However, you are permitted to travel to attend a medical 
                        appointment. You will need to show evidence of a recent negative coronavirus test before you depart, if the new rules are still in force, but Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has indicated that several different types of test will be accepted. From next week, passengers to the UK will need to prove at the start of their journey that they had a negative test for coronavirus less than 72 hours beforehand. PCR tests are seen as the âgold standardâ because of their high level of accuracy, but the results must be analysed in a lab, meaning they can take a day or more to come back. The government has suggested rapid lateral flow tests will also be acceptable. These are quicker and often easier to obtain than a PCR test, usually offering results within half an hour. Most UK arrivals â including those from Spain - must also quarantine on arrival for 10 days.  You may be able to shorten your self-isolation time if you pay for a test after five days, and it comes back negative. From next week (exact date to be confirmed) new rules are being introduced for travellers arriving in the UK. Before you board your flight from Norway, you will need to show a negative result from a recent coronavirus test. This includes UK citizens. In Scotland, this measure will be introduced âas soon as practically possibleâ. Anyone who tests positive for coronavirus will not be allowed to travel. Border Force will be carrying out spot checks on UK arrivals and those who do not fully comply with the roles face a Â£500 fine. Some people will be exempt from the testing requirement, including under-11s, hauliers, and people arriving from the common travel area or countries which do not have the infrastructure to conduct tests â this is unlikely to include Norway. Currently, people arriving in Scotland from Norway do not have to self-isolate. But Scotland and the rest of the UK is under a national lockdown, meaning that you should only make essential journeys after you arrive.  Making children repeat a year at school is something rarely tried in the UK, even though it is fairly common in the US and some other countries.  Commenting in June, the Department for Education said it was down to individual headteachers to decide how to educate pupils. âThis may, on occasion, include deciding that a child should be educated in a year group other than the one indicated by their age."" It added: ""Such decisions should be based on sound educational reasons and in consultation with parents.â However, itâs not clear whether the strategy works. Analysis by researchers at Durham University found that pupils who were held back a year were likely to make four months less progress than if they moved up a year with everyone else.  Whatâs more, the cost of keeping a pupil back a year is expensive - an estimated Â£6000, far more than it would cost, for instance, to provide intensive tuition for struggling pupils. It depends where in the UK her university is. In England, there is nothing explicitly stopping your daughter from going back to her halls, provided she has not been tested positive for coronavirus or is self-isolating. She also should not travel if she is displaying coronavirus symptoms. Unless they are doing certain practical courses such as medicine or dentistry, most university students have been told to âremain where they are wherever possibleâ until at least mid-February and start their term online. Students who go back to their university accommodation should either be tested twice upon their return, or self-isolate for 10 days, the government says. The higher education guidance for England says there is no ban on moving house âwhere necessaryâ including forming new households and moving into shared houses or student accommodation, but it warns that moving households comes with a risk of higher transmission. The Scottish government says that plans for studentsâ return should be developed in consultation with staff and students, and that arrivals should be staggered. Students are allowed to travel into Wales from anywhere in the UK if it is to resume their studies. However, the government in Wales says students should not go back until they are told to by their university, when in-person learning will resume.  In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland you can walk with one friend â but not with a group. Exercise is allowed with one person who is not in your household or support bubble, in a public outdoor place (for example, a park, a beach or in the countryside). You can only exercise with one person at a time, and you should not exercise more than once per day. Whatâs more, you should not travel outside your local area. In Wales, you are not allowed to exercise with anyone outside your household or support bubble. Support bubbles were not mentioned in the prime minister's lockdown announcement but the rules have not changed. You can form a support bubble with another household of any size if you are a single adult living with one or more children who were still under 18 on 12 June 2020.  As a parent, you can also form a support bubble if your household includes a child who was still under the age of one on 2 December 2020, or a child with a disability who requires continuous care and is under the age of five. Other reasons for a support bubble include living by yourself (even if carers visit you to provide support), or if you are the only adult in your household who does not need continuous care as a result of a disability.  You should not form a support bubble with a household that is part of another support bubble. There is nothing to stop you continuing your support bubble with your mother. Although the central message of the new lockdown is that everybody should stay at home where possible, the government's guidance says that you are permitted to leave your home and travel to visit your support bubble (and to stay overnight with them).  However, it's important that you follow guidelines when you leave home, which include social distancing, and not mixing with anyone other than your mother. When driving to see her, you should also not share your car with anyone not in your household. If your employer is eligible, you can ask them if you can be furloughed through the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. While on furlough you would receive 80% of your normal pay up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. The government has said that workers who need to look after their dependants are eligible for the scheme. If you work for the NHS, where most employees are not eligible for the furlough scheme, you should speak to your employer. NHS employers have been advised to be as supportive and flexible as possible towards staff with caring committments. The short answer is that we all have to stay at home, and only leave for a limited number of reasons, such as shopping, or work which cannot be carried out from home. If you are also classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, you should be shielding, and only go out for medical appointments, exercise or if it is essential.  The government has drawn up a list of conditions which would make a person extremely vulnerable. Your GP may also add you to the Shielded Patients List if they think you are at greater risk of serious illness. However, if you are in good health, your age is not itself a reason for you to shield. The fact that you have been vaccinated will not affect your ability to travel in or out of the UK, but you should still be allowed to travel to Poland if the purpose of your visit is to provide essential care for your sister. Poland insists on a 10-day period of self-isolation for anyone arriving in the country by public transport. You would not have to self-isolate if you had a negative Covid-19 test certificate issued within 48 hours before entering Poland (both PCR and lateral flow antigen tests are acceptable). You would have to pay privately for such a test.  You can also avoid self-isolation if you have been vaccinated against Covid-19 âand produce a certificate of vaccinationâ. However, the UK does not currently issue certificates of vaccination, and it is by no means certain that Polish border security would accept a vaccination record card as proof. When you return to the UK, you will still have to observe the rules which currently apply to all arrivals from Poland - a negative test before travelling, a 10-day period of self-isolation at home, with two further tests taken during that period. British Airways currently refunds passengers whose flights have been cancelled. However, some customers like you may have booked flights or holidays last year which they cannot now take, because of the regulations introduced since then to ban non-essential foreign travel.  If your scheduled flight is still due to go ahead but you cannot take it, BA will not offer a refund. However, it says that, âcustomers who are unable to travel, or choose not to, can continue to change their flights or request a voucher for future useâ. Consumer groups have said theyâre unhappy with BA and other airlines offering vouchers. If the price of the flight or holiday is more expensive on the re-booked date, the passenger has to make up the difference, and cannot choose to fly with a different provider who may be cheaper. Vouchers also have expiry dates.  The government watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority, is carrying out an investigation into whether airlines âhave breached consumersâ legal rights by failing to offer cash refunds for flights they could not lawfully takeâ. The NHS doesnât provide healthcare for UK nationals who live abroad, and this includes vaccinations. Youâre advised to seek medical advice from your local healthcare provider.  The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) says that itâs closely monitoring other countriesâ plans for rolling out vaccines, and can advise British expats where to find information about local programmes.  Specific advice on Oman can be found on the FCDOâs Travel Advice page and you can sign up for alerts whenever the advice is updated.  There are practically no exemptions from hotel quarantine for UK nationals arriving from the UAE - it is one of 33 red list countries where itâs feared new Covid variants might be spreading.  If you are vaccinated, you have a greatly reduced chance of catching the disease yourself, but you may still carry the disease and spread it to other people.  For that reason, you would have to obey quarantine laws or face a fine or prison sentence, just as you will have to follow the lockdown rules when you are in the UK. So far the vaccines seem to provide equally good protection against the UK variant - which emerged in the autumn and has now become the main strain of the virus in circulation.  There are signs the vaccine could be slightly less effective against another mutation found in the South Africa variant, but nevertheless the jab will still give very good protection.  And while the virus will keep mutating, vaccine developers are poised to update their jabs at relatively short notice.  Cases of the South Africa variant are in their tens in the UK at the moment, so itâs hoped travel bans will restrict further imports of cases containing this and any other genetic changes, that could make suppressing the virus more difficult.   The UK variant shares some similarities with the South African one, but doesnât generally have one of its more worrying mutations. The genetic change dubbed âE484Kâ shows signs of being able to hide from the bodyâs immune response and may cause vaccines to be less effective. However, the scientists who study the genetic makeup of coronavirus have found a small handful of test samples which, while they look like the UK variant, also have the addition of this alarming mutation.  A tiny number of samples (about 10) have been detected in Bristol which look like the Kent variant, but appear to have an additional mutation which itâs feared could make the vaccine slightly less effective.  Everyone in the relevant area is being invited for tests whether or not they have symptoms, and the government has said it is âcriticalâ they stay at home apart from when it is âabsolutely essentialâ â although no formal additional restrictions have been put in place.  Mutations happen when viruses reproduce inside the body, and thereâs a limited number of ways in which they can change - so we do see the same changes happening independently of each other in different countries.  The UK variant and the South African variant for example are made up of distinct constellations of mutations â but they contain some of the same genetic changes within them.  If you are over 16 and live or work in an area being targeted for the South Africa variant of Covid, you are strongly encouraged to take a test this week, whether or not you are showing symptoms. In most areas, home testing kits are being delivered and collected, while some councils are also providing mobile testing sites. The tests are PCR ones, which involve swabbing the nose or throat and are regarded as the most reliable. You need to register the testing kit online or via 119 so you can be sent the results. People with symptoms in the ""surge"" areas are being asked to apply for a test in the normal way.  No extra restrictions have been placed on the areas, above and beyond the current lockdown rules, and there is no ban on leaving home to work.  However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged people in the targeted areas to stay at home and only go out when ""absolutely essential"". No extra restrictions have been placed on the areas where testing is taking place for the South Africa Covid variant, above and beyond the current lockdown rules, and there is no ban on leaving home to work.  However, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said that people in these areas should be having a ""conversation with their employer about working from home"" to limit the time they spend outside their house. Under the current lockdown rules, people across the UK have been asked to work at home wherever feasible, and employers have been told to ""take every possible step"" to make this happen, including ensuring workplaces are ""Covid secure"". If you are unhappy and feel your employer is not addressing your worries, you should contact your local council or the Health and Safety Executive.  The new variant is rapidly replacing other versions of the virus in circulation in the UK, and passes more quickly from person to person. Experts are studying the virus to understand what the changes might mean. It is possible that the mutations make it easier for the virus to enter cells. It might be that people who are infected with the new variant have more of the virus in their nose and throat and can spread it more easily when they cough and sneeze. Saga Cruises attracted headlines recently when it announced it would not allow any passengers to board without showing proof of full Covid vaccination.  On its website the company says that it expects all travellers to have received the vaccine at least 14 days before they embark on a cruise. It adds: âYou will be required to bring the vaccination document and/or evidence with you as proof at the time of boarding.â In terms of proof, people who have been vaccinated could show their record card, but there is no âvaccine passportâ currently available, nor are there any concrete plans by the government to introduce one. The vaccines available for Covid are considered extremely safe and there are no reports of serious side-effects. People over the age of 18 with Downâs syndrome are currently being vaccinated as they are on the list of those considered to be extremely clinically vulnerable. The government is hoping to offer the vaccine to everyone on this list (as well as other high priority groups such as the elderly) by the middle of February. The extremely clinically vulnerable list was amended in November to add people with Downâs syndrome, after studies suggested they were at greater risk of becoming seriously ill if they caught Covid.  The vast majority of children and teenagers with Downâs syndrome are considered to be at less risk than adults, although teenagers aged 16-18 will be offered the vaccine during the second phase of the roll-out, planned for between the end of February and April.  Lots of people are wondering whether having the vaccine will stop them spreading coronavirus. We know the vaccine significantly reduces the risk of getting seriously ill with coronavirus. But it is unclear whether it stops people from catching it or passing it on to others. So it is really important that people continue with social distancing, wearing face coverings and washing their hands, even if they have been immunised. It's also worth remembering that it takes a few weeks after vaccination before you are protected. For the Covid vaccines currently available in the UK, two doses, spaced weeks apart, are recommended to give the best protection. However if you have already formed a support bubble with your father, you can have close physical contact with him. Itâs not clear yet how long immunity might last after 
                        vaccination.  It is possible that people will need to be vaccinated annually 
                        or every few years to have protection.  Yes. Allergy to penicillin is not listed as a clinical reason to avoid having either the Pfizer-BioNTech or the 
                        AstraZeneca-Oxford Covid-19 vaccine.  However, when you are invited for your Covid vaccine, you should discuss your allergies with healthcare staff to make sure there is no other reason to avoid it. The people giving the vaccines will be wearing appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) to help prevent the spread of virus.  Some will also have already been vaccinated themselves, due to their occupation as healthcare providers. Every vial, which contains several vaccine doses, is stored frozen and has to be thawed and then diluted before people are vaccinated. Healthcare staff will be given detailed information on exactly how long the vials can be stored in a fridge (five days) and when they should be discarded after being taken out. Prof Jonathan Van Tam says these considerations make this âdelicateâ vaccine more complicated to get to people in care homes and to the elderly in their own homes. But this wonât be as much of an issue in hospitals where vaccine doses can be stored in bulk and used quickly on staff and patients. At present, women are not advised to have a Covid vaccine during pregnancy, or if they are planning to get pregnant in the next three months. There are no safety concerns from any of the data but, as in most trials, the vaccine has not yet been tested on pregnant women. As a result, the official advice is that women should postpone being vaccinated until they have given birth. NHS guidance says that if a woman finds out she is pregnant after having the first dose, she should not have the second dose until after the pregnancy has ended. The vaccine distribution will be largely prioritised by age, so the majority of pregnant women would be low down on the list to receive it in any case. Even pregnant women who are at higher risk of coronavirus â with underlying heart conditions, for example â should wait until after their pregnancy and then have the jab as soon as possible afterwards. Although itâs been done quickly, this vaccine trial hasnât skipped any of the usual steps.  The only difference is that some of the stages overlapped so, for example, phase three of the trial â when tens of thousands of people are given the vaccine â started while phase two, involving a few hundred people, was still going on.  Side effects usually show up quite quickly after vaccination and longer-term effects are extremely rare â much, much rarer than long-term side effects of the virus.   Usually vaccine trials are slowed down by long periods of waiting around, applying for permission, funding and resources.  Itâs those elements that were sped up, because of the huge global interest in doing so. People will be vaccinated whether or not theyâve had Covid.  We donât yet know how long natural immunity lasts, and vaccination can offer better protection than immunity from the disease itself. No, people in the UK are not being told they must have the vaccine. However, those in the most at-risk groups (over-70s and care home residents), and people who work in care homes and for the NHS will be expected to have it - to protect themselves and the people they care for. Making a vaccine mandatory is not usually recommended because it can lower confidence in the jab. Scientists donât know the exact answer to that at the moment. The volunteers in the vaccine trials who were given the jab will be followed up for many months to come to check how long they are protected for. Natural immunity to the virus, once someone has been infected, appears to last at least six months so itâs likely a vaccine will offer this length of protection and hopefully a lot more. The vaccine significantly reduces the risk of getting seriously 
                        ill with coronavirus. But it is unclear whether it stops people
                        from catching the virus or passing it on to others. So it is really important that people continue with social
                        distancing, wearing face coverings and washing their hands,
                        even if they have been immunised. If your immune system is suppressed and not working as well as it might, some ""live"" vaccines are not recommended. This is because the weakened virus they are made from could cause problems. The Oxford vaccine is not a ""live"" vaccine. Scientists are testing which patients could benefit from it and whether this might include people with certain health conditions, or who are taking particular medication or undergoing treatment for something else, such as cancer or HIV. There are lots of different Covid vaccines in development and some may be more suitable for different groups than others. These three different Covid vaccines all appear to be safe and effective in trials. It will be up to regulators to check the data and decide whether to approve the jabs for widespread use.  The Oxford vaccine is based on a more traditional method for making vaccines than the Pfizer and Moderna ones. It uses a modified, harmless cold virus to carry the genetic information on Covid into the body to get the immune system to mount a response. The Oxford team has already used this technology to make vaccines for other diseases, including flu. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines use a brand new method for making a vaccine.  They contain a small amount of genetic code, made in the lab, to match the spike protein on the surface of the pandemic virus. This does not alter the genetics of human cells though, but triggers the immune system to make antibodies that can fight Covid.  Neither the Pfizer jab nor the Covid vaccines that could soon be approved for use - Moderna or Oxford/Astrazeneca â are made using eggs so there should be no issue for people with egg allergies. No vaccine is 100% effective for everyone. And 70% is still very good, particularly for a disease as serious as Covid-19. US regulators had said they would accept 50% protection as worth pursuing for Covid. Flu jabs are between 40% and 60% effective. Both vaccines need to be stored at below freezing temperatures when they are transported from the factory out to clinics.  The Pfizer jab needs to be kept at around -70C, which is somewhat challenging, while the Moderna one can be kept in a normal freezer temperature of -20C.  Both can be thawed and kept in a fridge once they arrive at the clinic, but the Pfizer one then has a short shelf life of five days compared to four weeks for the Moderna vaccine. The NHS has been planning how best to roll out the vaccine. It will be a large-scale immunisation programme, requiring lots of trained staff to administer the jabs.  Pharmacists, nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals will be able to vaccinate people in a range of settings â including care homes, hospitals and GP clinics as well as pop-up centres, such as sports stadiums and conference buildings.  It could mean some delays to some non-Covid NHS services, but urgent and essential care will be prioritised. The aim is to keep usual services running whenever possible. You could contact your GP to discuss any concerns you have. If you can't download the new NHS Covid-19 tracing app, it is probably because your phone runs on an older operating system. The app will only work on a certain number of newer models.  This is because it uses technology only recently developed by Apple and Google, which will not work on earlier operating systems.  Your phone must have the IOS 13.5 operating system installed (released in May 2020), or Android 6.0 (released in 2015), as well as Bluetooth 4.0 or higher.  This excludes the iPhone 6 or any earlier models, as well as old versions of Appleâs handsets (and some newer Huawei phones). If your smartphone is not compatible, the NHS Test and Trace Service is still the first port of call for any contact tracing issues.  Apple and Google's framework will not allow two apps to contact trace simultaneously.  So when you cross the border from England to Scotland, you need to open the Scottish app and turn on contact tracing within it. This will bring up a prompt asking: ""Switch app for exposure notifications?"" When you do this, it will turn off the app you were using beforehand. You can get your own unique QR code at this government website. All you need to enter is your email and your restaurant's address.  Every business, place of worship, event and community organisation with a public space should create a unique QR code they can display for visitors to scan. You can then print off a QR code poster. Itâs a good idea to put the QR poster near the entrance, so that visitors can log their location by scanning the poster with the track and trace app when they arrive. If you run more than one venue, you will need to create a separate QR code for each location. The government says that the app âhas been designed to work in the phoneâs background, working alongside other Bluetooth features and devicesâ, so your hearing aids should be unaffected. If you do find some interference, there is an online form to report this to them. There have been no reports of interference between the app and medical devices in trials, but the government says it is sensible to be cautious when you rely on a medical device â in particular, it has included advice for people who use pacemakers. Coronavirus is an infectious disease discovered in China in December 2019. Its more precise name is Covid-19. There are actually hundreds of coronaviruses - most of which circulate among animals, including pigs, camels, bats and cats. But there are a few - such as Covid-19 - that infect humans. Some coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the common cold. Covid-19 is among those that can lead to more serious illnesses such as pneumonia.  Most infected people will have only mild symptoms - perhaps a fever, aching limbs a cough, and loss of taste or smell - and will recover without special treatment. But some older people, and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, or cancer are at greater risk of becoming seriously unwell. The NHS has more about symptoms. When people recover from an infection, their body is left with some memory of how to fight it should they encounter it again. This immunity is not always long-lasting or totally efficient, however, and can decrease over time. It is unclear, though, if people who have recovered from coronavirus will be able to get it again. Hong Kong scientists have reported the first case of a man who was reinfected with coronavirus, although the World Health Organization has warned against jumping to conclusions on the basis of one case. University of Oxfordâs Prof Sarah Gilbert says that it âprobably is likelyâ that an infected person will be able to be reinfected in the future. Scientists have said that the âincubation periodâ - the time between catching the virus and starting to show symptoms - is five days on average. However, some people can have symptoms earlier or much later than this. The World Health Organization advises that the incubation period can last up to 14 days. But some researchers say it may be up to 24 days. Knowing and understanding the incubation period is very important. It allows doctors and health authorities to introduce more effective ways to control the spread of the virus. Both viruses are highly contagious. On average, it's thought people with the coronavirus infect two to three other people, while those with flu pass it on to about one other person. There are simple steps you can take to stop the spread of flu and coronavirus: If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to make arrangements with your employer if you cannot work from home.  For four out of five people Covid-19 will be a mild disease, a bit like flu. Symptoms include [fever, a dry cough or loss of smell and taste(https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51048366) If the virus gets well established in the lungs it can cause breathing difficulties and pneumonia. About one in seven people may need hospital treatment. Recovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people shrug off the illness quickly, but for others the path to full health can take months, and leave lasting problems. This is the subject of ongoing research, but little is still known about how many people are carrying the virus without knowing it. Different studies currently suggest a huge range of possibilities for how many ""silent spreaders"" there are - ranging from 5% to 80% of cases. That was the conclusion of an analysis by Prof Carl Heneghan of the University of Oxford and colleagues who looked at 21 research projects. The upshot, they said, was that ""there is not a single reliable study to determine the number of asymptomatics"". And they said that if the screening for Covid-19 is only carried out on people with symptoms - which has been the main focus of UK testing policy - then cases will be missed, ""perhaps a lot of cases"". Some scientists believe that asymptomatic cases may be the main force driving the pandemic, and there have been calls for increased testing to establish how many ""silent carriers"" there may be.  Diabetics are not included in the list of people at highest risk. However, some may be advised to take extra precautions if they suffer from a combination of factors, such as heart disease or obesity, as well as diabetes - which put them at much higher risk of complications. A third of virus deaths in England from 1 March to 11 May were linked to diabetes, but research suggests the threat for those under 40 with type 1 (insulin-dependent) or type 2 diabetes is still very low. Age remains the strongest risk factor for becoming severely or fatally ill with coronavirus, say experts. Diabetes UK advises anyone with diabetes to try their best to manage their condition carefully, keeping their blood sugar in range as much as possible, as well as following social distancing measures.  Asthma UK's advice is to keep taking your daily preventer inhaler (usually brown) as prescribed. This will help cut the risk of an asthma attack being triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus. Carry your blue reliever inhaler with you every day, in case you feel your asthma symptoms flaring up. If your asthma is getting worse and there is a risk you might have coronavirus, contact the online NHS 111 coronavirus service. Coronavirus can be more severe in older people and those with pre-existing conditions such as heart and lung illnesses, or diabetes. There is no evidence that disabled people who are otherwise healthy - and who don't, for instance, have respiratory problems - are at greater risk from coronavirus. Covid-19 can, in a small number of cases, lead to pneumonia, most notably in people with pre-existing lung conditions. But as this is a new virus, no-one will have any immunity to it, whether they have previously had pneumonia, or any other form of coronavirus such as Sars. Wearing masks presents major challenges for some deaf people who rely on lip-reading to communicate, but who also need to stay safe from catching the virus, especially if in a hospital setting. The charity Action on Hearing Loss says there are some clinically approved see-through covered face masks that help enable lip-reading. However, they do not provide enough protection against aerosols spread by coronavirus, and wouldnât be right for health and social care workers to use during this pandemic. Many of the experimental coronavirus jabs currently being tested contain the genetic instructions for the surface spike protein that coronavirus uses to attach to and infect human cells. Reassuringly, scientists have not seen any substantial mutations to this part of the virus yet that would render these vaccines useless. If youâre living with someone whoâs self-isolating, you should keep all contact to a minimum and, if possible, not be in the same room together. The person self-isolating should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened, and keep away from other people in the house. If you live with someone who has symptoms, you'll also need to self-isolate for 14 days from the day their symptoms started. If you get symptoms, self-isolate for 14 days from when your symptoms start, even if it means you're self-isolating for longer than 10 days. If you do not get symptoms, you can stop self-isolating after 10 days. If you or your housemates develop symptoms after 00:01 GMT on Monday 14 December, you will only have to self-isolate for 10 days. If you live with your partner, they count as being part of your household. If neither of you is showing coronavirus symptoms and you are already in close contact, having sex won't increase the likelihood of you catching the virus from one another. If one person does have symptoms, they should be self-isolating in a separate room. Using contraception such as condoms won't alter your risk of catching the virus, as having sex will bring you into close physical contact anyway.  ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told the BBC's Newsbeat. ""Essentially, any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth - increases the risk of passing on coronavirus."" On balance, this is almost certainly unnecessary.  While hand washing is very important for personal hygiene, none of the advice from the worldâs leading health bodies â the World Health Organization for example, the CDC in the US or the NHS in the UK â places any importance on hair washing one way or another. Itâs theoretically possible that you could catch the virus if someone sneezed on your hair and those droplets found their way to your eyes, nose or mouth (for instance if your hair fell over your face). However, research suggests that while virus droplets can survive for a couple of hours on some non-porous surfaces such as steel, there are few â if any â cases of Covid which can be traced back to being transmitted in this way.  The Department for Transport (DfT) has not made it compulsory for taxi drivers to wear face coverings in England because they say they do not want to interfere with the rules and regulations of different transport operators. However, DfT still advises that drivers wear face coverings when they are unable to socially distance. In any case, many major operators â Uber, for example â insist that face coverings are worn by both passengers and drivers. Transport for London has also asked all taxi and private hire companies to ensure drivers wear face coverings. Taxi drivers in Wales are advised but not compelled to wear face coverings, but it is mandatory in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Pregnant women are being advised by the UK government to stay at home and keep contact with others to a minimum. However, they should attend antenatal clinics as normal. There is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are more likely to get coronavirus. But, for a small number of women, being pregnant may change the way their body deals with a severe viral infection. The governmentâs chief medical adviser says this is a precautionary measure until scientists find out more about the virus and that ""infections and pregnancy are not a good combination in generalâ. Mothers pass on protection from infection to their babies through their breast milk. If your body is producing antibodies to fight the infection, these would be passed on through breastfeeding. Breastfeeding mums should follow the same advice as anyone else over reducing risk - cover your mouth when you sneeze and cough, throw away used tissues straight away and wash hands frequently, while trying to avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands. This is highly unlikely to happen, according to scientists and vets. While there are rare cases where an animal has caught the virus from a human, there is no evidence that humans can catch the virus from animals.  It is possible that a pet's fur could become contaminated if an infected person has previously touched or stroked the animal. But even without the threat of coronavirus, you should always wash your hands with soap and water after handling an animal or its lead, and avoid touching your nose and mouth. Self-employed people who have symptoms or have been told to self-isolate may apply for two benefits - universal credit or employment and support allowance. Normally, you would be eligible after four days of being ill. However, the government has responded to the spread of coronavirus by saying that companies will temporarily pay SSP from the first day off. But charities are worried that there is still a five-week delay before universal credit is paid. Anyone aged 18 or above can apply for universal credit if they live in the UK and are on a low income or out of work. Students in full-time education arenât usually eligible for universal credit, but they can make a claim if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child or are in a couple with a partner who is eligible for universal credit. People aged 16 or 17 can also apply for universal credit if they do not have any parental support, are responsible for a child, caring for a disabled person or cannot work. You can use the government's benefits calculator to find out how much you may be entitled to. The government advises that people who are self-isolating should work from home wherever possible and be paid as normal. If they canât work from home, employers must ensure any self-isolating employee gets sick pay or is allowed to use paid leave days if they prefer. Employees in self-isolation are entitled to Statutory Sick Pay for every day they are in isolation, worth Â£95.85 per week, as long as they qualify.  However, employers can choose to pay staff their full wages during this period if they wish. Research conducted by the Resolution Foundation has found that the coronavirus pandemic could increase youth unemployment by 600,000 this year. If youâre worried about finding a job you can head to the National Careers Service for advice on how to find job vacancies. You can also search online for virtual job fairs. This could help you explore different job opportunities and connect with potential employers directly from home. Experts recommend using lockdown to refresh your CV and also look for any online training opportunities which might put you in a better position when you eventually apply for a job. The short answer to this is no. It's true that you donât have to go into quarantine if youâre returning to the UK from whatâs known as the Common Travel Area (CTA) - Ireland, Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. When the government first announced its plans, there was some speculation that to avoid quarantine, travellers from other countries would be able to fly into an airport in the CTA, and then on to the UK and so avoid having to self-isolate. However, this loophole (termed by some the ""Dublin dodge"") has now been closed by the government. Travellers will only be exempt from quarantine if they have been in the CTA for 14 days or more. You will have to show proof of when you entered the CTA, and how long you have spent there - such as a boarding pass or itinerary - when you enter the UK. Key workers will not necessarily be exempt.  The government has published a detailed list of who will not need to follow the quarantine rules. Among others, it includes road haulage and freight workers, medical and care professionals providing essential health care, some seasonal agricultural workers, Eurostar and Eurotunnel employees, pilots and aircrew and people working to maintain key infrastructure such as the railways. It also depends where you are going in the UK - some employees will be exempt from quarantine in England and Wales, but not Scotland.  The government guidance details what youâll need to show when you enter the UK to prove you are exempt. This differs between categories but typically includes proof of your name and address, the name of your employer and what work youâll be doing. Unless your flatmates were travelling with you, they do not need to self-isolate or quarantine with you.  However, you must avoid contact with them and minimise the time you spend in shared spaces like kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas.  You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window to the outside that can be opened, separate from your flatmates, and if you can, you should use a separate bathroom from them. If you do need to share these facilities, regular cleaning will be required after each person has used them.  Make sure you use separate towels from the other people in your house, both for bathing and showering, and for washing your hands.  Not necessarily. If you have returned from holiday abroad and have to self-isolate in quarantine, you will not automatically qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP), so it's possible you might have to take the extra time off as annual leave, or else as unpaid leave. The Department of Work and Pensions says that anyone planning to travel should do so in the knowledge that they will be required to self-isolate on their return. It adds that employers and staff should discuss and agree any arrangements in advance, and urges employers to take socially responsible decisions. Meanwhile, the Foreign & Commonwealth Office is still advising UK nationals against taking all but essential international travel. What questions do you have about coronavirus?

AI used to 'predict the next coronavirus',"By Victoria GillScience correspondent, BBC News A team of scientists has used artificial intelligence (AI) to work out where the next novel coronavirus could emerge.  The researchers used a combination of fundamental biology and machine learning.  Their computer algorithm predicted many more potential hosts of new virus strains than have previously been detected.  The findings have been published in the journal Nature Communications.  Dr Marcus Blagrove, a virologist from the University of Liverpool, UK, who was involved in the study, explained: ""We want to know where the next coronavirus might come from.  ""One way they're generated is through recombination between two existing coronaviruses - so two viruses infect the same cell and they recombine into a 'daughter' virus that would be an entirely new strain.""  The researchers were able to plug existing biological evidence into an algorithm - teaching a computer how to spot viruses and host species that were most likely to be a source of this recombination.  First, the team ""asked"" their algorithm to find use biological patterns to predict which mammals might be susceptible to known coronaviruses, which revealed links between 411 strains of coronavirus and 876 potential mammal species.Â  The crucial, predictive step was in looking for species that were able to harbour several viruses at once. Lead researcher Dr Maya Wardeh, who is also from the University of Liverpool, was able to use existing biological knowledge to teach the algorithm to search for patterns that made this more likely to happen.  ""We were able to predict which species had the chance for many coronaviruses to infect them,"" she explained. ""Either because they are very closely related [to a species known to carry a coronavirus] or because they share the same geographical space,"" she said.  This step concluded that many more mammals were potential hosts for new coronaviruses than previous surveillance work - screening animals for viruses - had shown.  The Asian palm civet and greater horseshoe bat, for example, were predicted to be host to 32 and 68 different coronaviruses, respectively. And in species including the common hedgehog, the European rabbit and the dromedary camel, the algorithm predicted that Sars-CoV-2 might recombine with other, existing coronaviruses. The scientists say their findings could help to target the surveillance for new diseases - possibly helping prevent the next pandemic before its starts.  ""This is not a reason to demonise these species,"" Dr Wardeh stressed, pointing out that ""spill-over"" of viruses into human populations tends to be linked to human activities like wildlife trade and farming.    ""But it's virtually impossible to survey all animals all the time, so our approach enables prioritisation. It says these are the species to watch,"" the University of Liverpool researcher added.   The scientists say the ""ideal"" use of this technique would be to help find viruses as they're recombining.  ""If we can find them before they get into humans,"" said Dr Blagrove. ""Then we could work on developing drugs and vaccines and on stopping them getting into humans in the first place.""

Another new coronavirus variant seen in the UK,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Scientists have identified another new variant of coronavirus in the UK with some potentially troubling mutations.  B.1.525 appears similar to the South African variant which prompted door-to-door tests in areas where it has been found.  Researchers from Edinburgh University have found 38 cases so far - 2 in Wales and 36 in England - in samples dating back to December.  It has been seen in other countries, including Denmark, Nigeria and the US.  UK experts are studying it to understand what risk it poses.  It is too soon to say if it should be added to the UK's list of ""variants of concern"" and whether mass testing for it should happen. So, for now, it is a ""variant under investigation"". Prof Ravi Gupta, from the University of Cambridge, is one of the scientists advising the government on new and emerging virus threats.  He said B.1.525 appeared to have ""significant mutations"" already seen in some of the other new variants.  ""That is partly reassuring because we can predict what their likely effect is."" Prof Yvonne Doyle from Public Health England (PHE) said: ""PHE is monitoring data about emerging variants very closely and where necessary public health interventions are being undertaken, such as extra testing and enhanced contact tracing. ""There is currently no evidence that this set of mutations causes more severe illness or increased transmissibility."" One of these changes B.1.525 has is a mutation called E484K - also found in the Brazil and South African variants - that may help the virus evade some of the body's immune system defences. Other alterations make it similar to the UK 'Kent' variant that experts say is more contagious than the original version of coronavirus that started the pandemic.  The concern is that the virus is changing in ways that could let it easily spread and escape from the vaccines that we already have to fight Covid.  Current ones were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new variants being seen now, although perhaps not quite as well. Prof Gupta and colleagues have been running tests in the lab and say mutations like E484K do represent a threat to vaccines.  Scientists are already working on new vaccines that are a better match for new variants, in case they are needed ahead of next winter.   Prof Andrew Hayward, an expert in epidemiology at University College London, said: ""Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be spreading any faster than other strains and it's still at very, very low levels.  ""With all of these variants, we really need to be keeping a very close eye on them because we don't know what they will do."" Will vaccines always work against Covid?

Will vaccines always work against Covid?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New variants of coronavirus are emerging that are more infectious than the one that started the pandemic.  One of these, first found in Kent, could become the world's dominant strain, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme has predicted. There are concerns vaccines may not work quite so well against some variants. There are many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating.  Experts' concerns focus on a few: It's not unexpected that new variants have developed - all viruses mutate as they make copies of themselves to spread and thrive. Most of these differences are inconsequential. A few can even be harmful to the virus's survival. But some can make it more infectious or threatening. There is no evidence that any of them cause much more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.  As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions.  For the UK variant there is some research suggesting it may be associated with a 30% higher risk of death. The evidence is not strong and the data is still uncertain though.  Measures such as washing your hands, keeping your distance from other people and wearing a face covering will still help prevent infections. Because the new variants appear to spread more easily it is important to be extra vigilant.  The UK, South Africa and Brazil variants could be much more contagious or easy to catch.  All three have undergone changes to their spike protein - the part of the virus which attaches to human cells.  As a result, they seem to be better at infecting cells and spreading.  Experts think the UK or ""Kent"" strain emerged in September and may be up to 70% more transmissible or infectious. The latest research by Public Health England puts it between 30% and 50%.  The South Africa variant emerged in October, and has more potentially important changes in the spike protein. Experts have recently found a small number of cases of the UK variant that have one of these more concerning changes too.  It involves a key mutation - called E484K - that may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. The Brazil variant emerged in July and has this E484K mutation too.  Current vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well.   Early results suggest the Pfizer vaccine protects against the new variants, but is slightly less effective.  Two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - appear to offer some protection too.  Data from the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine team suggests it protects just as well against the new UK variant. It offers less protection against the South Africa variant - although it should still protect against severe illness.  Early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is effective against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or long-lasting. Variants could emerge in the future that are more different again. Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match - in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary, say experts.  As with flu, where a new shot is given each year to account for any changes in circulating flu viruses, something similar could happen for coronavirus. More variants will emerge.  Scientists around the world are on the look-out and any important ones will be closely studied and monitored.  Experts are already working on updating coronavirus vaccines. The UK Government has announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with a pre-order of 50m doses. Urgent testing for the South Africa variant and other new versions of coronavirus with the E484K mutation is being done in parts of England. New coronavirus variant: What do we know?

"Four fined £10,000 over red-list travel breach","Four air passengers have each been fined Â£10,000 for failing to declare they had travelled from a ""red-list"" country, West Midlands Police has said.  They were stopped at border control by officials and were not able to leave Birmingham Airport.  Under new rules, arrivals in England have to quarantine in hotels, if within the last 10 days they have been in a country deemed a high Covid risk. The ""red list"" of 33 countries includes Portugal, Brazil and South Africa. The regulations came into effect on Monday and the four passengers had been fined by midday, a senior officer told a meeting of the West Midlands Strategic Policing and Crime Board. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said that in the same timeframe, the airport received six passengers who did declare travel from a red-list country, who were taken to a quarantine hotel. But of the offenders he added: ""There are some people who have attempted to hide their routes but that's not worked out."" A police spokesperson said the fines were issued by Border Force.  Birmingham Airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK.  Those who fail to self-isolate as required face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The rules aim to stop coronavirus variants entering the UK. It was not clear in the board meeting which country or countries the fined parties had been in. Just four flights touched down in Birmingham on Monday, including a plane from Istanbul with about 100 passengers, some of whom were believed to be from a red-list country. The other four airports where quarantine hotel guests may enter the UK include Heathrow, Gatwick, London City and Farnborough.

Why is Scotland slowing down vaccinations?,"By Steven BrocklehurstBBC Scotland News First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland's vaccination programme is slowing down because of supply problems. Ms Sturgeon told Holyrood on Tuesday that vaccine manufacturer Pfizer had not reduced the overall number of doses Scotland will get but it had ""re-phased"" the delivery. This meant there would slightly less supply than originally expected over the next few weeks, she said. The first minister said Scotland had now vaccinated more people than originally outlined in the deployment plan and also that some vaccines would need to held back for second doses. On Monday, there were 32,814 people given the first dose, just above half of the 61,299 on the same day the previous week. Last week, an average of almost 47,000 people per day were given the first dose of the vaccine. That compares with 36,000 the previous week and less than 20,000 in the seven days before that. After complaints that the Scottish programme was ""lagging behind"" the other UK nations, it had done much better over the past two weeks to catch up. So, how are the nations doing? It is understood that the Scottish government had been allocated more than 800,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine by the first week of February and more than 650,000 doses of Oxford Astra-Zeneca - making more than 1.45 million doses. However, if supplies are to slow over the next few weeks they would soon exhaust any excess supply. The actual figures for the numbers of doses received and expected are no longer published following a disagreement with the UK government over whether the data was sensitive in an international marketplace for the vaccine. Last week, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""This is about the supply into the UK, it is not about distribution around the UK. So it will affect all four nations of the UK. ""That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines."" She said that would mean ""we will need to scale back a bit"". Ms Sturgeon, speaking at her briefing on Monday, said the daily tally for the next week would likely be no more than 30,000 a day. Caroline Lamb, the chief executive of NHS Scotland, also told a Holyrood committee that a further ""dip"" was expected towards the end of March.  The 15 February was a major deadline for the vaccine programme, with a target of giving the first dose to everyone aged 70 and over as well as those who are clinically extremely vulnerable. Along with previous vaccinations for health and social care staff and care home residents and staff, this came to a total of 1.14 million people. A further 280,000 people aged 65 to 69 will need to be given their first dose by early March. After that, the target is to give a jab to everyone over 50 and people under 65 with serious health conditions and unpaid carers by the start of May. That is a further 1.96 million people. Very roughly, that target will require vaccine doses to average 28,000 a day but there will also soon be the need to factor in second doses. So far Scotland has done very few second doses - just 17,137. That is because of the decision to extend the time period allowed to administer the second dose to 12 weeks. The first Pfizer vaccines were given in the week beginning 8 December. The people who got the first dose then will need their second dose in the next two weeks. However, only 115,000 people were given the vaccine in the first month of the programme so the number of people who need to be given a second dose before the end of March is quite low - adding an average of 2,500 per day to the vaccine total. The latest figures show 2,636 people were given a second dose on Monday, the most on any single day so far. Scotland opened three mass vaccination centres two weeks ago and a number of other large centres have also come on stream. This has allowed Scotland to ramp up its programme considerably, some days giving vaccines to more than 60,000 people, well over 1% of the adult population each day. However, the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow has now halted vaccinations on two days this week because of shortage of supplies. Other centres have also reduced their hours of operation and the number of appointments. A UK government spokeswoman said last week: ""There is currently no issue with vaccine manufacture or supply and we are still confident that the steady, regular supply of doses will continue to support the vaccine rollout right across the UK in the weeks ahead."" However, it is understood some mass vaccination centres in Wales are expected to reduce their operating hours in response to a planned dip in supply. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said they would factor in the 'temporary slowdown' of vaccine supply over the next couple of weeks but that had been worked into their plans. A spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said they were not aware of any issues. A spokesman for Pfizer said it had made modifications to production facilities in Belgium to scale up manufacturing capacity in Europe, with ""overall projected supply"" of vaccines to the UK remaining the same for January to March. It was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upscaled production capacity at its plant in Puurs, Belgium. A Pfizer spokesman said that following the completed work it was fulfilling deliveries to the European Union ""in line with the original agreed schedule"" and was working towards increasing deliveries beginning the week of 15 February. They added: ""In the UK, we are continuing to liaise closely with the government to deliver the 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that we have committed to supply before the end of the year and can confirm that overall projected supply remains the same for quarter one [January to March].""

Affordable flats planned at 'homeless' aparthotel,"A serviced apartment block being used to house homeless people during the coronavirus pandemic could be turned into 40 new affordable homes. Flexistay, which operates the aparthotel in Padworth, wants to convert the existing building into 20 flats and build 20 more next to it. Under plans submitted to West Berkshire Council all the flats will be available to rent under a let-to-buy scheme. The programme offers affordable leases that allow tenants to save a deposit. According to the proposal, the new homes will be a mixture of one, two and three bedroom apartments over three floors, with communal gardens and 50 car parking spaces. They will be in ""stacked modular blocks"" designed to look like a ""cluster of smaller buildings rather than one large building"", the plans state. Flexistay said the new homes would provide economic security and other benefits for those ""struggling to meet day to day needs due to high rental costs"", according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. It said: ""The proposal is for a 100 per cent affordable housing scheme consisting of 40 new flats providing stability for low income or vulnerable families in the area."" If approved by the council, housing provider company RentPlus will rent out and maintain the development. West Berkshire Council is due to make a decision in March.

'No reason' education review cannot be published,"A senior figure in Scottish education says he can see ""no reason"" why a review into Scotland's secondary education system has been delayed. Dr Keir Bloomer, one of the architects of the Curriculum for Excellence, said the sooner the independent review was published ""the better"". It had originally been expected to be released in February, ahead of the Holyrood election in May. The Scottish government has blamed the delay on the Covid-19 pandemic. The review is being led by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It was initially intended to examine the senior phase of Scottish education (S4-S6) following a critical report from a Scottish Parliament committee, which said there had been a ""lack of clear leadership"" from officials and ""some narrowing of subject choice"". Education Secretary John Swinney was later forced by opposition parties to widen the review to include the whole of the Curriculum for Excellence - effectively the entire school system. Mr Swinney announced in April that publication of the review would be delayed until June 2021. It has now emerged that the authors of the report have completed a draft of the review. Dr Bloomer told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that he could not see any reason for delaying publication until June. He added: ""The whole purpose of the OECD review was so that we can learn from the many, many mistakes which have been made in the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence. The sooner the report is in the public domain, the better. ""The only reason the government can possibly have for seeking to maintain secrecy over this review is that it's trying to get the OECD to alter what it says, and that to my mind is completely insupportable."" But the Scottish government said the OECD's review was still ongoing. A spokesman said: ""The OECD has been engaging virtually with stakeholders over the last few months and have met with a wide range of education bodies as well as undertaking virtual school visits.  ""They will be holding an engagement event at the beginning of March, where they will share emerging messages with stakeholders, providing a further opportunity for key partners and practitioners in Scotland to inform the final report, which will be published in June 2021."" However, the Scottish Liberal Democrats believed the government was ""trying to stitch up"" the independent review. Party leader Willie Rennie said: ""It is scandalous that SNP ministers get to see the first findings from the OECD six months before anyone else. Conveniently, the rest of us only get sight of anything after the Holyrood elections. ""Who knows what that will look like given these new documents show ministers will already be scribbling notes on the OECD's first draft We need an unedited, OECD interim report before the election, and one that doesn't have SNP ministers' fingerprints all over it."" The Curriculum for Excellence was launched in Scottish schools in 2010 and gives teachers more flexibility over what and how they teach. The delay of the review was announced by Mr Swinney in a written answer to fellow SNP MSP Gordon MacDonald in April 2020. The education secretary said the Scottish government remained committed to the review of the Curriculum for Excellence, but had agreed to delay engagement with ""practitioners and learners"" until October. Scottish schools were closed in late March 2020 because of the coronavirus outbreak and did not reopen fully until August.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-56081250,1
Who is on the shielding list now?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online More people are being added to the shielding list in England. These people are advised to take extra care to avoid contracting Covid-19, because they are considered more at risk of needing hospital treatment.  Health advisers say they now have a clearer picture of who is high risk.  About 1.7m people are being added to the list, bringing the total to about 4m. These people will soon get a letter from the NHS explaining why they are being advised to shield.  A combination of factors can contribute to a person's risk - those taken into consideration include:  What is your covid risk? Government guidelines strongly advise clinically extremely vulnerable people to stay at home at all times, apart from going out to exercise or attend a medical appointment.   The advice, which runs until 31 March, says to try to keep all contact with others to a minimum and avoid busy areas. If you go out, maintain strict social distancing, wash your hands regularly and avoid touching your face. You should also try to stay 2m (6ft) away from other people within your household, especially if they display symptoms of the virus or have been advised to self-isolate. Shielding was never compulsory and it is still your choice to decide what you are comfortable about doing. Everyone in England is expected to follow the lockdown rules. If possible, take things at your own pace and talk through any worries you have.  People on the list are still advised to shield even if they have had two doses of the vaccine. No vaccine is 100% protective and immunisation will not stop all spread of the virus. Social distancing measures are advised for everyone.  People on the shielding list who have not yet been offered a vaccine  - around 820,000 adults - will be offered an appointment soon to get immunised. The only people able to visit you at home are those in your support bubble - such as a relative or other person who helps with your care needs. You can go out and exercise with the people you live with or someone in your bubble.  The advice says you should not leave the house to work. If you cannot work from home, you may be eligible for Statutory Sick Pay, Employment and Support Allowance, Universal Credit or the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. People on the shielding list are strong advised against visiting any shops, including pharmacies.  If you already have a priority delivery slot with a supermarket, that will continue. If you cannot access food or medicines, your local council can offer support.  An NHS Volunteer Responders service can help with collecting prescriptions and groceries.  Devolved administrations decide who should be on the shielding list in each country.  People shielding in Scotland and Wales have been told not to go into work under new lockdown advice.  In Northern Ireland, medically-vulnerable and older people are advised to be particularly careful in following the recommendations on limiting contacts. High risk categories include:  The list does not include all elderly people, although they are strongly advised to do social distancing. Guidance from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says that most youngsters with conditions such as asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, and kidney disease do not need to be on the shielding list held by the NHS. About 90,000 people shielding are under 18. Children will only be removed from the list by their GP or specialist doctor after discussions with the child and their family. If you have been told that your child no longer needs to shield, they can go to school, college or nursery.  Children who live with someone who is clinically vulnerable, but aren't themselves, should go to school.  3 people, 3 different Covid risks.

Thousands of Amazon staff get wrong Covid results,"Nearly 4,000 Amazon workers were given incorrect coronavirus test results after an error. Private test results shared with NHS Test and Trace led to 3,853 notifications being wrongly issued on 13 February, the government confirmed. Employees were told by Amazon the day before they were negative for the virus, then given the exact opposite message by contact tracers. One test and trace call centre received more than 500 calls from employees. The company has been testing frontline UK workers privately since October, sending the results to Public Health England, who then share them with NHS Test and Trace and equivalent bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Amazon said it had followed NHS instructions and all workers had been made aware of the error and supported to take ""appropriate action steps"". The Department for Health and Social care said all employees wrongly issued self-isolation notifications were ""rapidly"" informed they did not need to. In messages seen by the BBC, one warehouse worker was told they were negative for Covid-19 on Friday by their employer and then wrongly notified they were positive by NHS Test and Trace and told to self-isolate for 10 days on Saturday morning. A follow up message from contact tracers confirming a ""system error"" was sent that evening. A call centre employee, working for a private company on behalf of test and trace, told the BBC the error led to thousands of confused Amazon employees contacting the 119 helpline. The call handler, who wishes to remain anonymous, said their team alone received more than 500 calls on Saturday. They said: ""It's not only affected their staff, but the families and households of their staff as well. ""Partners and children of Amazon staff who were added as contacts, told bosses they had to isolate and have lost income."" The Department of Health and Social care said the ""vast majority"" of people reported no issues with the testing and contact tracing process. A spokesman said: ""Working closely with Amazon, NHS Test and Trace rapidly notified affected employees to let them know they did not need to isolate.""

Employment tribunal backlog 'hugely significant',"A backlog in Northern Ireland's employment tribunal system has been described as ""hugely significant and very troubling"". More than 93,000 claims are waiting to go through the industrial and fair employment tribunal system. Of those, 82,300 relate to holiday pay and pensions claims, which are stayed pending further litigation. The Belfast Telegraph has reported that large numbers of the cases relate to PSNI members. The physical tribunal office remains closed due to Covid-19 until at least 1 March. Employment solicitor Suzanne Keenan, of MKB Law, said it is taking several months for claims to be processed by the tribunal and an initial response issued, a process that would normally take weeks ""As a result cases are taking more than twice as long to progress even through the early stages,"" she said.  ""In all likelihood cases issued recently are unlikely to be heard until 2023 or beyond."" Ms Keenan said the impact for clients and lawyers was ""hugely significant"", especially for those who have lost jobs. She added that the delay could impact people's recollection of events and respondents having significant claims hanging over them for long periods of time. ""A further major concern I have is whether it will discourage claimants bringing their claims or continuing to pursue them,"" she said.  ""As an experienced employment lawyer I have never had to navigate anything quite like this in my entire career and the frustration is now being felt on a very real level within the profession and by the clients."" Ms Keenan said while Covid-19 has been very difficult to manage, other jurisdictions did not seem to be facing the same delays and issues. ""I would like to see confirmation of opening arrangements for necessary functions of the tribunal as soon as possible and a clear plan around addressing the backlog of claims with timescales,"" she said.  ""I would also like to see a plan for expediting hearings and planning around hearings proceeding in person, where necessary, with the appropriate measures, remotely or as hybrid hearings if necessary.""  In a statement, the Department for the Economy said: ""The Office of the Industrial Tribunals and Fair Employment Tribunal have a current caseload of 93,188 claims of which 82,300 relate to holiday pay and pensions claims which are stayed pending further litigation."" It added that these were not necessarily 93,000 individuals with claims, as many have lodged multiple claims. ",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56075240,1
"Only reopen pubs when safe, says brewer with Covid","A brewery boss who is in hospital with Covid has called for pubs to only reopen when safe to fully serve people. Simon Buckley, chairman of the Brewers of Wales, said he had been at ""death's door"" but was now ""on the mend"" at Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen. He said pubs must only reopen when it was ""the right time"" and rules could be properly enforced. A revised plan out of Wales' lockdown, which began in December, is expected in the next few days. Before Christmas, pubs, bars and restaurants across Wales were forced to close as ""stay at home"" lockdown measures were introduced, leaving them able to only sell takeaways. There have been repeated warnings from the sector about the impact of Covid restrictions on the hospitality and tourism industry, with Brains pubs being taken over after the company came under ""significant financial pressure"". Mr Buckley, the owner of Evans-Evans Brewery in Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire, said while the industry was now desperate to reopen, it should only happen when customers felt safe. ""We have written off tens and tens of thousands of pounds worth of stock because of stop- start... everybody wants a safe environment, but if we are having rules, lets have rules which are enforced,"" he said. ""We have to get the pubs open but we have to do it at the time and in a place and in a way that makes sense for our consumers."" Mr Buckley spoke as the chairman of JD Wetherspoons said pubs should reopen at the same time as non-essential shops. Speaking on the Jason Mohammad show on BBC Radio Wales, Mr Buckley, who has been in hospital for 13 weeks, said he previously thought he was a ""superhero"" and immune from Covid. He said that if pubs were to reopen any time soon, scenes like that in Cardiff city centre in September, where people crowded outside bars and clubs, must not be allowed to happen again. ""I've just been very very lucky... there are people who every day have risked their own life when they were sorting me out,"" he said. ""People need to understand this is not a joke... and I for one was brazen, I was bold enough to think that I wouldn't get it, I was Mr superhero. ""I was at death's door... had it not been for the nursing staff, the chairman of the Brewers of Wales would not be talking to you today, about rolling out our industry and saving it for the future."" Mr Buckley said the industry had measures in place to keep the public and staff safe and could be reopened successfully, but if people behaved irresponsibly, it could ""give us huge problems"". Since the start of the pandemic, businesses have been closed and reopened as lockdown rules changed, with measures introduced including alcohol bans and early closing times. While the Welsh Government is yet to set out any moves to ease current restrictions, its guidance for alert levels suggests that pubs, bars and restaurants would be allowed to reopen, but initially alcohol sales will be banned and they will have to close at 18:00. Even at alert level one - the lowest level of restrictions, when cases are at their lowest - they would have to stop serving at 22:00. Speaking from the hospital, Mr Buckley said the sector must not be placed in a position again where pubs were told to open and then forced to close again, leading to thousands of pounds of food and drink being thrown away. ""What we would ask for is no limited opening hours, no limits on the offer we can make, it's open properly, let us do what we are good at,"" he said. ""We have to make sure that it is not stop-start, we have to make sure that when we go, we go professionally and properly and the government is behind us, not looking to trip us up at every opportunity.""

Treasury minister reveals 'budget of resilience',"A ""budget of resilience"", aimed at stabilising the Manx economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, has been unveiled by the treasury minister. Setting out the present government's final budget in Tynwald, Alfred Cannan said the public cost of coronavirus in 2020-21 had been about Â£208m. He said government spending would rise in the coming year to Â£1.161bn, which equated to Â£13,740 per person. He also announced additional funding for health and climate change projects. Mr Cannan said the figure for Covid-19 spending included more than Â£100m spent on supporting the economy and revenue losses, which he said had seen a ""very significant"" Â£74m deficit. However, he said the island had managed to ""demonstrate sustainable levels of economic activity"" in the ""most challenging of years"", which had served to highlight the ""intrinsic value"" of the government's reserves and the ""resilience"" of the Manx economy. ""The actions we have taken and the costs we have incurred has saved lives, has protected this nation, has protected jobs and the economy, and indeed has protected public finances,"" he said. Under the 2021-22 budget, tax rates, National Insurance contributions and personal allowances will remain unchanged, nursing care cost contributions will rise by 15.6% and pensioners will benefit from a 2.5% increase in the basic state pension and the Manx state pension. The majority of other benefits see little or no changes. Overall, government spending will rise from Â£1.07bn to Â£1.161bn. However, public sector pay increases have been capped at 1% for the year, down from 2%. Analysis: Catherine Nicoll, BBC Isle of Man There were no big surprises in Alfred Cannan's latest budget, the last to be delivered during the current administration. The extent of the pandemic's impact was predicted back in July after the island's first lockdown and the increased spending on health and social care, perhaps recognition that the DHSC has been underfunded for many years, signals a commitment to the new model for care delivery, which was approved back in 2019. And while the treasury minister may be disappointed he was unable to continue easing the tax burden on those on lower incomes, he will take some comfort in the knowledge that despite the impact of Covid, he has managed to avoid tax increases. Overall, it is not the most exciting or daring of budgets, but it is one that looks to keep the island on an even keel and offer some hope for the future. The additional health care funding includes Â£8m to deal with a ""longstanding structural deficit"" in the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) payroll budget and more than Â£4m to fund a ""significant number of new posts"" under the new Manx Care body, Mr Cannan said. Manx Care, which will come into operation in April, will operate ""at arm's length"" from government and will mean the separation of policy setting and health and social care delivery, as recommended in Sir Jonathan Michael's review of the DHSC. The increased funding will also be used to meet Sir Jonathan's other recommendations, including enhancing services such as dermatology. The funding also includes another Â£9m for climate change adaptation schemes and Â£5m for mitigation initiatives, which include flood defences. An additional Â£15m has been set aside for capital projects, including continued work on the refurbishment of Douglas Promenade and the progression of a new ferry terminal in Liverpool, taking the total funds available to Â£182m.

Vaccine impact visible in over-80s blood tests,"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  England's vaccination programme is starting to pay off, with the over-80s age group now the most likely to test positive for coronavirus antibodies, Office for National Statistics testing suggests. Blood tests reveal more over-80s than any other age group in England are showing signs of some immunity against Covid infection. This comes as Covid deaths have fallen. But overall, deaths are still 40% above the five-year average.  People have antibodies to Covid if they've had an infection in the last few months or if they have been vaccinated.  Previously, younger age groups who were more likely to be exposed to the virus were the most likely to test positive for antibodies. In England, 41% of over-80s tested positive for antibodies, which the ONS said was ""most likely due to the high vaccination rate in this group"".  Two weeks ago that figure was 26%. It takes two to three weeks for immunity to build after vaccination. The next most likely to have antibodies against Covid in England were people aged 16-24 years - 26% of this age group had them, due to infection rather than vaccination.  This percentage has only increased a small amount in the past fortnight. In the other three UK nations, which have jabbed a smaller proportion of their older people, antibody detection remained highest in younger groups.  Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have not published data for week-on-week comparisons. Falls in deaths are likely due to lockdown, but rising antibody levels offer hope of even better news to come.  These figures cover deaths registered in the first week of February, probably reflecting infections early in January.  Back then, far fewer people had been vaccinated and, since it takes few weeks for the jab to yield antibodies, even fewer had been vaccinated early enough to get protection from Covid-19.  So lockdown was probably doing the heavy lifting.  Since the first week of February, the news has improved further. Back then, the daily death toll was just under 1,000 a day. Now it's down to around 650.  And there are hints, but only hints, that vaccination is starting to take some of the strain.   More and more people, especially over 80, are showing antibodies - a quarter by the middle of January and 40% by the start of February.  That figure will only rise. And some analyses suggest that deaths are falling fastest in older people.   Even it's too soon to be sure that's a vaccination effect, it's not too soon to be hopeful that it might be.  Meanwhile, there were 7,820 Covid deaths registered in the UK in the week to 5 February - a fall of more than a tenth from the previous week (9,010). That puts all deaths for any reason 38% higher than the average for the same week over the past five years.  This is the first time there has been a real fall in deaths in the ONS data since the last lockdown, although it refers to a fortnight ago.  The government figures published each day already show significant falls in deaths. Deaths involving Covid accounted for 43% of all mortality in England and Wales in the week to 5 February. This means a doctor has judged it to be a factor and written it on a patient's death certificate.  For 90% of these deaths, Covid was the main underlying cause.

Health board warning amid rise in cases,"People need to follow coronavirus rules amid a rise in cases, a health board has warned. Powys Teaching Health Board said the number of positive cases had been ""rising sharply"", with the county now seeing the third-highest rate of cases in Wales. Latest figures show 220 people in the area have now died with the virus. Stuart Bourne, director of public health in Powys, said the rise could be a result of recent outbreaks. The health board area currently has a case rate of 117 cases per 100,000 people but has risen above the Welsh average, which is falling. The latest weekly mortality figures show Powys reported its second highest weekly deaths total involving Covid-19 since the pandemic began. Altogether, there have been 220 deaths involving Covid since last March in the county, 17 in the most recent week. Public Health Wales has reported a total of 56 deaths for the area, but these do not include people who have died across the English border. Mr Bourne said the higher numbers were ""partly due to outbreaks of Covid-19 in specific settings across the county"", as well as new variants of the virus. He said it was ""vital"" all employees in workplaces followed guidance - in particular car sharing and congregating ""should not take place"" and ""if at all possible, people should be working from home"". ""Workplaces provide an opportunity for infection to spread, especially in settings where people work closely, where there is a high throughput of staff and where the environment may allow the virus to persist."" He added that ""there is evidence that a new, more infectious strain of Covid-19 is circulating in Powys"".  ""The 'Kent' variant is now commonly being isolated in the test results of Powys residents.  This is concerning because it is more easily spread and it is more likely that exposure to the virus will lead to infection. ""This is why it remains vital that we all continue to follow the advice to stay at home, follow social distancing rules and wear face coverings in indoor public places. ""Vaccination does offer the hope of a brighter future, but for now it is crucial that we continue to do all we can to protect ourselves and others from Covid-19."" According to data published on Tuesday, Wales has an overall case rate of 88 cases per 100,000 people, a figure which has consistently fallen in recent weeks. Ceredigion continues to have the lowest case rate at 24.8 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire (40.5), Bridgend (55.8) and Monmouthshire (57.1). Wrexham, with 137.5 cases per 100,000 people, and Flintshire (127.5), still have the highest case rates, although both have reported consecutive falls in recent days.

International air show cancelled due to Covid-19,"One of the largest air shows in the world, which attracts around 160,000 people every year, has been cancelled due to Covid-19. The Royal International Air Tattoo had been due to take place at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, between 16-18 July.  Organisers said there were too many risks to plan further ahead as large sums of money could be lost if the show had to be cancelled nearer the time. The event had been due to celebrate its 50th anniversary this year.  It is the second year in a row the show, which raises money for the Royal Air Force Charitable Trust, has been axed due to the pandemic.  The tattoo is among the world's largest military air shows and is the UK's biggest military aviation event. Chief executive officer Paul Atherton said they had hoped the show could take place this year, but with five months to go, there were ""still too many unknowns"". He said: ""If we knew with some degree of certainty what the situation would be in the summer we'd be able to plan ahead, but the truth is we simply don't know.  ""We have reached a point where, to plan further, would involve us committing large sums of money to secure the event infrastructure.  ""Without any insurance being available this year, this money would be lost if the airshow had to cancel nearer the time. It was simply too big a risk to take."" Mr Atherton said he knew the decision would leave a lot of people disappointed, especially as the event was due to celebrate its 50th anniversary, but public safety was ""paramount"".  ""By making this decision in a timely and controlled manner, we will be in a far stronger position to bounce back in 2022,"" he added.

Jo Whiley: 'I'd give up my vaccine in a heartbeat',"DJ Jo Whiley has said she is living ""a nightmare"" after being offered a Covid vaccine before her sister, who has a learning disability and diabetes.  Her sister Frances has since tested positive for coronavirus after there was an outbreak in her care home. The BBC Radio 2 presenter said she would give up her vaccine for her sister ""in a heartbeat"". The vaccines minister said people with a learning disability in residential care were now starting to get the jab. People with diabetes, as well as those with a ""severe or profound"" learning disability, are in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine.  Those in priority groups five and six - which include the over-65s and people considered clinically vulnerable - started to be invited to book a jab on Monday.  Nearly six out of every 10 people who died with coronavirus in England last year were disabled, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics. For people with a medically diagnosed learning disability, the risk of death involving Covid was 3.7 times greater for both men and women compared with people who did not have a learning disability. On Thursday night, Whiley, 55, said she got the call she had been ""dreading"", when she found out there had been an outbreak of Covid in her sister's care home.  ""I feel like I'm living through a nightmare,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""The whole weekend has been awful. It's been really, really difficult."" ""And then ironically I got a message to say that I was due to have my vaccine before my sister, who's got learning disabilities and underlying health conditions,"" she said.  The DJ added that she didn't know why she had been invited to get the jab, but said it was possibly because she was deemed a carer for her sister, who is 53 and has the rare Cri du Chat genetic syndrome.  Unpaid carers for the elderly and people with disabilities are in priority group six.  ""I would give up my vaccine in a heartbeat, if I could, for my sister and any of the residents in her house to have their vaccineâ¦ it does not feel right,"" she said.  Whiley said she wanted to speak up for people like her sister ""who have been overlooked"".  ""This happens so often - people with learning disabilities are neglected, they haven't got a voice,"" she added.  Since the interview, Whiley has found out Frances has tested positive for the virus. In a tweet, she said her ""worst fears"" had been realised, with the prospect of a vaccine so close.  ""Feel like I'm in a terrible film with bad plot twists,"" she said. ""She's ok so far... Everything crossed."" Feel like Iâm in a terrible film with bad plot twists. Late last night I got a call to say that Frances, my sister, had tested positive & has COVID. Our worst fears realised after keeping her safe for a year & with a vaccine so close... sheâs ok so far.. Everything crossed ð¤ð pic.twitter.com/ia5Lr2z2Xv The charity Mencap is calling for everyone with a learning disability to be in at least priority group six for the vaccine.  Chief executive Edel Harris said the current limitation to people with a ""severe or profound"" learning disability was ""arbitrary and subjective"".  ""[That definition is] not used by the medical profession,"" she told Today. ""We think GPs, who are under enormous pressure at the moment, are having to use their discretion."" Adults with Down's syndrome, which usually causes some level of learning disability, are in priority group four because they are considered clinically extremely vulnerable. Asked about Frances's situation on the same programme, the government's Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said: ""The case you've just described to me - living in residential care with a learning disability - is now being vaccinated in category six. We've just embarked on category five and six - that is happening now so that case will be picked up. ""Of course we will need to wait 28 days after infection for us to be able to go back - hence why for residential care we go back four times to deliver the two doses because sometimes people can't be given the first dose until the infection is over after 28 days.""

Hard-hit city's jab rollout 'must be prioritised',"Preston should be prioritised in the coronavirus vaccination rollout along with other areas where infections remain high, a council boss has said. Latest figures show the city has the highest rate of infection in Lancashire - 248 per 100,000 in the week to 11 February - though cases are falling. Council leader Matthew Brown said low income families and the ethnic minority population have been affected more. He said more resources should be diverted accordingly. Mr Brown's call came after Lancashire County Council said it would ask the government for ""clarity"" over a cut to Covid-19 vaccination supplies. Stocks of the jab in North West England are being cut by a third to allow areas that have vaccinated fewer people to catch up. ""I have long been concerned about the disproportionate effect of Covid on our minority communities, as well as the poorest in our city,"" Mr Brown said. ""The two are often linked, because there tends to be more deprivation in areas where you have a higher BAME population. ""People on low incomes are two-and-a-half times more likely to be affected by Covid and certain parts of the BAME community even more so. ""We need to prioritise based around the reality that if you're well off and live in an area where it's quite spacious, the virus is not going to spread as much - whereas if you've got a lot of terraced houses, it is going to spread. ""We need to have a universal approach, but we need to put more resources into areas where people are affected the most.""  Preston is in the top 20 areas with the highest case rates in England, though rates are down 29% in the latest figures, 248 per 100,000 in the week to 11 February from 347.9 the previous week. The city was regularly registering some of the highest infection rates nationwide as the pandemic began to deteriorate last September, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.

'Packed nightclub' with 150 revellers raided,"Police have raided a makeshift club, complete with DJ, bar and VIP area, where about 150 people were ""packed in"". Officers were pelted with bottles as clubbers tried to break out of the Birmingham building and were seen fleeing via the roof. About 70 people were fined Â£200 and the DJ faces a Â£10,000 fine. On the same night, 13 people were found in a workshop that had been turned into a bar nicknamed ""The Covid Arms"". West Midlands Police said the garage workshop in Dudley Port had a sign on the wall displaying its new name.  Officers used their discretion to allow the dozen people in there to leave, but the owner was issued with a Â£1,000 fine, the force said. In Birmingham, police said taxis were seen dropping people off at the building on Buckingham Street in the Jewellery Quarter and when officers went inside they found crowds filling two floors, a bar and VIP area.  A search of the premises led to officers also finding a recording studio and gym. One officer suffered a minor injury as a door was smashed open by people trying to break out of the club area, the spokesperson added. Thermal imaging from police drones captured people trying to escape by the roof in the early hours of Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Todd said people must remember lockdown continues and Covid-19 is still a threat to communities. ""Our officers continue to work long and hard to protect the public and reduce the spread of this deadly virus by breaking up these gatherings, often in really difficult circumstances. ""It's unacceptable that our officers came under attack, and that one suffered a minor injury, just for doing their job and enforcing laws that are in place to keep us all safe.""

Fauci wins $1m prize for 'defending science',"The US top infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, has been awarded a prestigious $1m (Â£717,000) Israeli prize for his commitment to science. Dr Fauci, who was often at odds with former President Trump over how to handle the pandemic, was given the Dan David Prize for ""defending science"". He was also praised for advocating for Covid vaccines, and for his leadership on HIV research and Aids relief. Dr Fauci, 80, has advised seven US presidents. He was recognised for ""courageously defending science in the face of uninformed opposition during the challenging Covid crisis"", the awards committee said in a statement. He ""is the consummate model of leadership and impact in public health,"" it added.

"Rapid tests could help reopen clubs, PM suggests","Quick coronavirus testing could enable nightclubs and theatres to reopen, Boris Johnson has suggested. The PM said ""rapid"" lateral flow tests could be used by ""those parts of the economy we couldn't get open last year"". ""That, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he told a Downing Street news conference. But he stressed it was ""still early days"", with ""lots of discussions still to be had"". A government source said: ""There is a long way to go before we can get people back at big events safely."" Nightclubs have been unable to operate since the first Covid lockdown in March 2020, while many theatres have struggled to make social distancing work. It comes as Mr Johnson said people must be ""optimistic but patient"" about an end to coronavirus restrictions in England. He said steps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"" ahead of next week's release of a roadmap for lifting curbs. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said that the government favoured testing over vaccine passports as a means to reopen the economy, since it is not yet clear whether a vaccinated individual can transmit the virus. Mr Zahawi described preliminary evidence on the effect of vaccines on coronavirus transmission as ""really encouraging"", but told the BBC the full data might not be available for weeks. ""We have a couple of very large-scale studies related to giving us better data on the vaccines,"" Mr Zahawi told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""We should be able to see really good data in the next few weeks from those studies."" Michael Kill, the boss of the Night Time Industries Association, said administering rapid tests would not be straightforward, even if it was the way venues such as nightclubs were allowed to reopen. He told the BBC that professionals would be required to administer swab tests outside the venue, where clubbers would need to wait for at least 15 minutes to get a negative result before being allowed in. That would force venues to stagger admissions and have procedures in place to deal with positive cases and those who they came into contact with. Lateral flow tests have the major advantage of not needing to be taken to a lab to be processed, unlike the more expensive PCR tests used by NHS Test & Trace. They work by dipping a nose and throat swab in special solution and then dropping that fluid onto a plastic stick - a bit like a pregnancy test. During a testing pilot in Liverpool, the devices picked up two-thirds of the most infectious cases. But the study found the devices only picked up 40% of all cases - fewer than expected. The tests may miss people in the day or two before they are about to become infectious. Read more about the tests here. Mr Kill said allowing revellers to perform tests the day before or under the supervision of a professional over a video call could make the process less onerous. Nevertheless, he welcomed Mr Johnson's announcement. ""Finally we have some acknowledgement from the prime minister and government on the existence of late-night economy businesses, including nightclubs, theatres, casinos and late bars, particularly as they are some of the hardest hit since the start of the pandemic,"" he said. Sacha Lord, who co-founded Manchester's Parklife Festival, said the events sector had been ""shattered over the past eleven months"", adding that any further delay to implementing initiatives such as rapid testing at venues would do ""irreversible"" damage to the UK's cultural sector.  ""The night-time and live music industry has been discussing the need for on-site rapid testing for over five months, and we have suggested this on multiple occasions to MPs and during Select Committee hearings,"" he said. ""My fear is that they take another five months to get moving, which the industry simply doesn't have."" The UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections on Monday, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays because of a reporting lag over the weekend.

"450,000 families ‘behind on rent because of Covid’","Almost half a million UK families are thought to have fallen behind on rent, as a result of the coronavirus crisis, according to the Resolution Foundation. It said more than 750,000 had been behind on housing costs last month. That is 450,000 more than January 2020. ""Despite widespread calls for forbearance in the face of the Covid-19 shock, just 3% of private renting families have been able to negotiate a lower rent over the last 10 months,"" the think tank said in a report. Meanwhile, one in 20 private renters in the UK said they had been refused rent reductions. Many had taken ""huge hits"" to their earnings and had ""limited savings"" to fall back on, research director Lindsay Judge said. ""To make matters worse, measures that could ease the pressure, such as discretionary housing payments from local authorities and negotiated rent reductions from landlords, are not getting through to those that need them."" Almost one in four private renters had seen their income fall as a result of the crisis, the body said.  And it did not expect an easing of lockdown restrictions to be enough to solve their problems. ""Both benefit cuts and the end of furlough are pencilled in for the spring, either of which will strain family incomes further,"" it said. ""Likewise, unemployment looks set to rise, rather than fall, through 2021, potentially driving up arrears further still."" Landlords in England have been banned from evicting tenants until at least the end of March, offering ""some security"", the Resolution Foundation said, by preventing families under the most strain becoming homeless during the pandemic. Housing is a devolved issue, and Wales and Scotland have also extended their bans to the end of March. In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. But the Resolution Foundation also wants the government to offer loans to tenants to ease a ""rent-arrears crisis"" it expects to worsen in the months ahead. Meera Chindooroy, from the National Residential Landlords Association, said loans would help tackle the rent debts owed to property owners. ""Simply banning repossessions is doing nothing to address this underlying problem which renters and landlords are struggling to cope with,"" she said. A government spokeswoman said: ""Robust protections put in place by the government remain - with the vast majority of renters still subject to six months' notice periods, while the ban on bailiff evictions in all but the most serious circumstances will stay in place until at least 31 March.""

Which countries trigger hotel quarantine?,"People arriving in the UK now have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining, and some must pay to self-isolate at a hotel. It's  one of a number of rules aimed at stopping the spread of new, potentially more resistant Covid strains from other countries. Rule-breakers face stricter penalties, including a prison sentence of up to 10 years for those who lie about having been in a banned ""red list"" country, such as Portugal.  All incoming passengers must complete a passenger locator form in advance, including their departure country and UK address.  They also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours before travelling, to be allowed entry.  Travellers must then self-isolate for 10 days. Arrivals must take a coronavirus test on days two and eight of quarantine, at a cost of Â£210. If they test positive, they must self-isolate for a further 10 days. There is a Â£1,000 penalty for not taking the test, followed by a Â£2,000 fine for failing to take the second one, with quarantine automatically extended to 14 days. The government says these measures will provide a ""further level of protection"", enabling authorities to track new cases more effectively. A few workers are exempt from quarantine, including pilots and some seasonal agricultural workers.  Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own travel rules, which differ slightly. Under the ""test to release"" scheme, travellers from countries not on the red list can take a test on day five of isolation.  People who test negative can stop isolating. Those who test positive must quarantine for 10 more days after the test. Anyone using the scheme still has to take a further test on the eighth day. Tests cost between Â£65 and Â£120. There are concerns existing vaccines may not work quite so well against some variants of coronavirus, including the South Africa and Brazil variants. There are currently travel bans on 33 countries ""where the risk of a new variant is greatest"".  Travellers who have been in the following countries in the the 10 days before travelling are already banned from entry, unless they are UK residents or Irish nationals. The government has warned that other countries could be added with just a few hours' notice. UK residents and Irish nationals arriving in England from red list countries will have to quarantine in hotels selected by the government.  People entering Scotland from any country by air have to isolate in hotels. Arrivals from countries in the Common Travel Area - the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man, and the Channel Islands - are exempt. These travellers can only enter the UK at five airports: In England, this will cost Â£1,750 per passenger travelling alone, to cover transport, tests, food and accommodation.  Every additional adult, or child over 12, costs Â£650, while children aged five to 12 cost Â£325. Accommodation must be booked in advance through an online booking system. Heathrow Airport has warned that ""red list"" travellers may face suspended flights and long queues at the border. Arrivals will be escorted straight to their hotel and must stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying them if they go outside. Households will be allowed to quarantine together, and some hotels may allow them to exercise.  Those who fail to quarantine in a designated hotel face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000. Anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list will face a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Hauliers travelling from Portugal are exempt from hotel quarantine and do not have to present a negative test. Lockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including: People leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure. Antibodies test A medical test that can show if a person has had the coronavirus and now has some immunity. The test detects antibodies in the blood, which are produced by the body to fight off the disease. Asymptomatic Someone who has a disease but does not have any of the symptoms it causes. Some studies suggest some people with coronavirus carry the disease but don't show the common symptoms, such as a persistent cough or high temperature. Containment phase The first part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which involved trying to identify infected people early and trace anyone who had been in close contact with them. Coronavirus One of a group of viruses that can cause severe or mild illness in humans and animals. The coronavirus currently sweeping the world causes the disease Covid-19. The common cold and influenza (flu) are other types of coronaviruses. Covid-19 The disease caused by the coronavirus first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs. Delay phase The second part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, in which measures such as social distancing are used to delay its spread. Fixed penalty notice A fine designed to deal with an offence on the spot, instead of in court. These are often for driving offences, but now also cover anti-social behaviour and breaches of the coronavirus lockdown. Flatten the curve Health experts use a line on a chart to show numbers of new coronavirus cases. If a lot of people get the virus in a short period of time, the line might rise sharply and look a bit like a mountain. However, taking measures to reduce infections can spread cases out over a longer period and means the ""curve"" is flatter. This makes it easier for health systems to cope. Flu Short for influenza, a virus that routinely causes disease in humans and animals, in seasonal epidemics. Furlough Supports firms hit by coronavirus by temporarily helping pay the wages of some staff. It allows employees to remain on the payroll, even though they aren't working. Herd immunity How the spread of a disease slows after a sufficiently large proportion of a population has been exposed to it. Immune A person whose body can withstand or fend off a disease is said to be immune to it. Once a person has recovered from the disease caused by the coronavirus, Covid-19, for example, it is thought they cannot catch it again for a certain period of time. Incubation period The period of time between catching a disease and starting to display symptoms. Intensive care Hospital wards which treat patients who are very ill. They are run by specially-trained healthcare staff and contain specialist equipment. Lockdown Restrictions on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people told to stay at home. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. Mitigation phase The third part of the UK's strategy to deal with the coronavirus, which will involve attempts to lessen the impact of a high number of cases on public services. This could mean the NHS halting all non-critical care and police responding to major crimes and emergencies only. NHS 111 The NHS's 24-hour phone and online service, which offers medical advice to anyone who needs it. People in England and Wales are advised to ring the service if they are worried about their symptoms. In Scotland, they should check NHS inform, then ring their GP in office hours or 111 out of hours. In Northern Ireland, they should call their GP. Outbreak Multiple cases of a disease occurring rapidly, in a cluster or different locations. Pandemic An epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in many countries simultaneously. Phase 2 This is when the UK will start to lift some of its lockdown rules while still trying to reduce the spread of coronavirus. PPE PPE, or personal protective equipment, is clothing and kit such as masks, aprons, gloves and goggles used by medical staff, care workers and others to protect themselves against infection from coronavirus patients and other people who might be carrying the disease. Quarantine The isolation of people exposed to a contagious disease to prevent its spread. R0 R0, pronounced ""R-naught"", is the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person. If the R0 of coronavirus in a particular population is 2, then on average each case will create two more new cases. The value therefore gives an indication of how much the infection could spread. Recession This happens when there is a significant drop in income, jobs and sales in a country for two consecutive three-month periods. Sars Severe acute respiratory syndrome, a type of coronavirus that emerged in Asia in 2003. Self-isolation Staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people, with the aim of preventing the spread of a disease. Social distancing Keeping away from other people, with the aim of slowing down transmission of a disease. The government advises not seeing friends or relatives other than those you live with, working from home where possible and avoiding public transport. State of emergency Measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even deploying the armed forces to support the regular emergency services. Statutory instrument These can be used by government ministers to implement new laws or regulations, or change existing laws. They are an easier alternative to passing a full Act of Parliament. Symptoms Any sign of disease, triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection. The main symptoms of the coronavirus are a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. Vaccine A treatment that causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection. Ventilator A machine that takes over breathing for the body when disease has caused the lungs to fail. Virus A tiny agent that copies itself inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interrupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease. What do all these terms mean? Are you due to arrive in the UK?

Injured rescuer mission 'worst in 25-year career',"A mountain rescue volunteer has said saving a colleague who suffered life-changing injuries in a fall was the worst mission of his career. Chris Lewis, 60, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m) in the Lake District on 6 February. He was part of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue team going to the aid of two campers from Liverpool and Leicester after one fell ill. Both campers have been fined Â£200 for breaching coronavirus lockdown rules. Mr Lewis, who also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes above Kirkstone Pass, is still in intensive care. His colleague Mike Blakey said: ""I've done this for 25 years, I can honestly say this was the worst rescue.  ""I've seen some things in my time but you never expect to have to rescue one of your own.  ""He's having conversations with me already about where we are going to go in the wheelchair."" Rescue volunteer Ben Hammond, who was the first to get to Mr Lewis after he fell down a steep slope, said: ""He's a very experienced member of the team and is someone to look up to.  ""Certainly his injuries are life-changing."" The campers, who called for help after one of them started suffering chest pains, have been widely condemned online, but Martin Cotterell from the team said volunteers ""are not there to judge"". ""We are there to help,"" he said. ""We all love the fells, we are all mountaineers, we go out there because we think we can help people in difficulty. Trying to judge is wrong."" While Mr Lewis was airlifted to hospital by the Coastguard, the ill camper was taken by the rescue team to an ambulance that transported him to Carlisle Infirmary, from where he was later discharged. Online fundraisers have been set up and raised thousands of pounds for the team. Local resident Kate Whittenbury, who started one of the funds, said: ""Local people are quite angry about it to be honest. It didn't really have to happen, they shouldn't have been here in the first place.  ""I just thought something positive needed to be done to offset the negativity."" Richard Warren, chairman of the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, said Mr Lewis was a ""fantastic guy"" and the support had been ""overwhelming"".

Could delivery drivers help spot domestic abuse?,"By Jenny ReesBBC Wales home affairs correspondent Research is underway to discover whether delivery drivers are witnessing domestic abuse during the Covid outbreak - and how they can help. Lockdown has given rise to concerns violence at home has become a ""shadow pandemic"". The Wales Violence Prevention Unit wants ""to make domestic abuse everybody's business"". They and public health experts say lockdown means colleagues in virtual meetings could help. People like drivers could also be witnesses.  ""One of the things that's often said is that it's people's private business,"" said Jo Hopkins, who oversees violence prevention for Public Health Wales. ""Or people are concerned that doing something will either make the situation worse, or put themselves in danger. ""And so an attitudinal shift needs to be made. We're keen to better understand what we need to do, so people understand that domestic abuse is everybody's business."" This week an anonymous survey has been launched for those who have seen or suspected abuse. It will ask what has stopped people from helping, and what is needed for more people to act. ""We're not necessarily talking about huge interventions,"" said Ms Hopkins.  She said anyone could call the Live Fear Free helpline if they are concerned for someone they know. ""But if someone makes that leap and asks for help, it really needs to be responded to in the right way,"" she said.

""They're trained in protection of vulnerable adults and level-one child protection.Â  ""If they see any concerns or they feel that something is not right they usually bring it back to the pharmacy, tell the pharmacist and the pharmacist will then make the judgement whether or not to intervene and possibly somebody's family member who can go in and check with them.""

'Doing my cancer treatments alone was scary',"A campaign has started to prevent children and young people receiving cancer treatment alone in the pandemic. Charities behind the #Hand2Hold campaign want to enable all young people aged 16 to 25 to be allowed a chaperone, instead of only some.  Mikaela Forrester, 18, from Somerset had some of her cancer treatments alone and said she did not want other young people to have that experience. She said without her mother she found it ""scary"" and ""lonely"". Miss Forrester lives in Frome and was diagnosed in July 2019 with Stage 2 Hodgkin Lymphoma, an uncommon cancer that develops in the lymphatic system. In March 2020 she was told she had relapsed and would need to undergo a further round of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and a stem cell transplant.  Because of the coronavirus pandemic, she was told she had to have those treatments on her own, without immediate support from her family or friends.  She said: ""When I had my transplant and my cells harvested with three weeks in hospital, with no visitors, it was just so scary. ""It was quite lonely. ""Even if I could hug my parents, or if they could stand two metres away with a mask on, just knowing they were there during the most difficult times would have made me feel comfortable because it was so overwhelming."" The campaign is being led by Teenage Cancer Trust and children's cancer charity CLIC Sargent. Both charities have sent open letters to UK health minsters urging them to change the current pandemic policies for young cancer patients. It was after they discovered an inconsistent approach being applied among hospitals in England allowing relatives or friends to accompany young people to their appointments.  Their research suggested 90% of 100 respondents aged between 16-25 said they had not been allowed a chaperone during the Covid-19 outbreak.  Chief nurse at Teenage Cancer Trust Dr Louise Soanes said the charity understood extra precautions had to be taken to protect people from coronavirus, but asked for some compassion too. ""Having cancer treatment, receiving a diagnosis or learning or hearing how you're responding to treatment, can be for many a scary and isolating experience.  ""We want to dispel the disparity so all young people, where safe and possible, have that crucial loved one with them and a hand to hold, particularly during some of the most difficult times of their life,"" she said.

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. Scotland's First Minister Nicola SturgeonÂ is due to set out later her government's plans for getting pupils currently in Covid lockdown back into classrooms. Currently, the youngest pupils and older children who have to do coursework are due back in from next week. And while Ms Sturgeon has said she is ""very keen"" to have a phased return to school, Scottish ministers will reviewÂ the latest coronavirus data and scientific advice before confirming the next steps later.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said that speedy tests which would show if a person is infectious could be the way to reopen parts of the UK economy which have been closed since the pandemic began - such as nightclubs - and places that have struggled with social distancing, like theatres.Â But Mr Johnson stressed that it was early days and any steps towards lifting lockdown measures would be ""cautious but irreversible"". Hotel quarantine for people flying back to the UK began on Monday, but for one family from Fife, a lack of familiarity with the rules meant they ended up spending a night in an Edinburgh Airport hotel instead of going home. The Scottish government requires all arriving passengers to enter ""managed isolation"" and because Chun Wong and his daughter had flown to Scotland from the US they were required to check in to a hotel. But officials realised a mistake had been made because Mr Wong had transited via Dublin, and so therefore should be treated as an arrival from the Irish Republic, which is exempt from the rules. The Wongs are due to return home to Fife on Tuesday. The government says it hopes to make Covid a manageable disease like flu. Vaccination and new treatments, they argue, will reduce the death rate, allowing us to live with the virus rather than constantly trying to fight it. Is this the right approach? And is it even possible? Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is this has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980. It is easy to forget flu kills. Back in 2017-18 more than 20,000 people died from it.

Famous polar exploration ship training off NI coast,"By Chris AndrewsBBC News NI The UK polar exploration ship RRS Sir David Attenborough has been conducting sea trials off the north coast of Northern Ireland. The vessel is expected to make its maiden voyage to Antarctica in November. Its mission is to help with research into climate change, the oceans, the seafloor and ice formations. Chief Officer Matthew Neill, from Coleraine, said it was an ""amazing feeling"" to bring the ship to NI. ""I grew up sailing around Portrush, but I've never taken a big ship to the north coast,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I'm amazed at the buzz it's created."" The Â£200m Royal Research Ship (RRS) - which was almost dubbed 'Boaty McBoatface' after a public poll - is operated by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS) with plans for a trip to the Arctic in the coming months before it sets sail for a first mission to Antarctica. The exercises off the coasts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland have focused on preparations such as driving practice, anchoring, making fresh water from salt water and small boat work. Matthew Neill, who is second in command behind the ship's captain, made his first trip to Antarctica as a cadet with BAS in 2011. He said he knows what to expect, but added there is ""excitement"", especially among inexperienced crew members, for what is to come. ""We're trying a lot of things for the first time, so it's good to see everybody gelling and coming up with ideas and testing the procedures we've written,"" he said. Describing RRS Sir David Attenborough as a ""science and logistics vessel"", he said one of its duties is ""supplies in, scientific samples out"". However, he explained the ship is also set up for scientific experiments, such as oceanography, gathering live samples, studying the structure of the sea bed and there is an atmosphere suite to record air samples. The vessel was commissioned to succeed the RRS Ernest Shackleton and RRS James Clark Ross, both named after famous polar explorers. While the new ship has taken his name, broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough also has a role to play. ""The vessel has a PA system so we can make announcements to the whole crew and Sir David Attenborough recorded some of these for us, so we can press a button and he says things like 'the ship is ready to depart, all personnel not sailing with the ship, please get off the ship',"" Mr Neill explained. When a public poll was held to decide the ship's name, the suggestion 'Boaty McBoatface' went viral and became the overwhelming choice. While this was eventually dismissed, the name was used for one of the ship's sub-sea vehicles. Despite a life at sea, the chief officer said the crew must keep to coronavirus restrictions and undergo rapid flow testing twice a week. ""We wear masks all the time, unless you are in your cabin alone,"" he outlined. ""There's also social distancing, hand washing, alcohol gels everywhere, washing surfaces down, more than we used to."" Mr Neill said he hoped the arrival of the ship to NI's shores would bring some joy amid a ""dull, hard winter for most people"" due to the pandemic. Many people took to social media to share images of the ship off the coast. ""It has been well received,"" Mr Neill said. ""It was nice to see people come out to see the ship and trying to enjoy a bit of fresh air where they can.""

China arrests leader of fake vaccine scam,"China has arrested the leader of a multi-million dollar scam that passed off saline solution and mineral water as Covid-19 vaccines.  The man, identified as Kong, had researched the packaging designs of real vaccines before making more than 58,000 of his own concoctions. A batch of the vaccines were smuggled overseas, but it is not known where they were sent to.  Kong is among 70 people who have been arrested for similar crimes.  The arrests, involving more than 20 cases, came as Beijing vowed to crack down on fraudulent vaccines.  Even though most of the cases surfaced late last year, new details were released this week. According to a court ruling, Kong and his team made a profit of 18m yuan ($2.78m; Â£2m) by putting saline solution or mineral water in syringes and hawking them as Covid vaccines since August last year.  A batch of 600 of these vaccines were sent to Hong Kong last November, before they were shipped abroad. The sales were made on the basis the vaccines were acquired via ""internal channels"" of genuine manufacturers.  In other cases, counterfeit vaccines were sold at inflated prices in hospitals. Other criminals also conducted inoculation programmes of their own and had ""village doctors"" vaccinate people with fake jabs in their homes and cars.  China's highest prosecuting body, the Supreme People's Procuratorate has urged regional agencies to cooperate with the police to curb such activities.  Officials had hoped to administer 100 million Covid doses before the Lunar New Year last week, but have only vaccinated 40 million people so far. However, the country has largely managed to bring the pandemic under control with strict lockdown, testing and tracing measures.  What do we know about China's Covid-19 vaccines?

New WTO boss warns against vaccine nationalism,"By Jonathan JosephsBusiness reporter, BBC News The newly-appointed head of the World Trade Organization (WTO) has told the BBC that vaccine protectionism must be overcome to solve the pandemic. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said ""a phenomenon where rich countries are vaccinating their populations and poor countries have to wait"" must be avoided. In recent weeks, several countries have tried to prevent the export of vaccines made within their borders.  But Dr Okonjo-Iweala said protectionism would hinder a global recovery. ""The nature of the pandemic and the mutation of many variants makes this such that no one country can feel safe until every country has taken precautions to vaccinate its population,"" she said. Until the end of last year Dr Okonjo-Iweala chaired the global vaccine alliance, GAVI, which aims to increase access to vaccines around the world and she now says the WTO has crucial work to do in this area. There is an ongoing debate about relaxing WTO rules on intellectual property so that more drug manufacturers can make the jabs. Dr Okonjo-Iweala acknowledged that whilst ""some developing countries are asking for waivers, developed countries feel that this might impinge on intellectual property"". But she argues for ""a third way, in which we can licence manufacturing to countries so that you can have adequate supplies while still making sure that intellectual property issues are taken care of"". That is already happening with the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, which has been licenced to the Serum Institute of India.  While the pandemic is the most pressing challenge facing the WTO's new leader, it is not the only one. The organisation is in a fight for relevance in the eyes of many countries that consider its rules outdated and believe that the organisation itself has been slow to adapt to changes in the global economy. After a selection process which was dragged out by a lack of support from the administration of former US President Donald Trump, Dr Okonjo-Iweala is mindful of what her victory represents. ""I'm proud to be the first woman and the first African,"" she said. However, she is keen to get to work as a reformer, a reputation she earned when she was second in command at the World Bank, and as Nigeria's Finance Minister, where she won significant reductions in her country's international debt obligations.  She said: ""There is an issue of broken trust between members and a lot of work [to be done] to update the rules of the WTO to [meet] 21st century realities."" If the challenges of coronavirus can be tackled, those ""small steps, early wins and successes can then help create the trust and allow you to do the bigger reforms"", she said. Among those challenges is an elusive deal on fishing subsidies. ""From there, we can go on to reform the dispute settlement system, which is moribund at the moment, but which is needed, because that's the only place in the world where members can bring trade disputes."" It was brought to a halt by President Trump vetoing the appointment of new judges to the body tasked with solving those disagreements. ""From there, we can go on to update the rules on areas like the digital economy and e-commerce,"" she said, adding that she also wanted to change the way women are served by the WTO and how climate change and trade are thought about. The US-China trade war is another area where the WTO has struggled to have an impact, given its lack of enforcement mechanisms. And that is despite a ruling last year that US tariffs were ""inconsistent"" with international trade rules. Dr Okonjo-Iweala said: ""We can be very helpful to both the US and China to help bring them together to solve these problems."" One reason the WTO has struggled to make progress in many areas is because of the insistence that decisions be made by the consensus of all 164 members.  When asked if decisions should be taken on a majority, rather than consensus basis, Dr Okonjo-Iweala said: ""It should not be such that this manner of decision making gets in the way of welfare enhancing innovations or measures for the membership.""

Why goal is to live with the virus - not fight it,"Nick TriggleHealth correspondent@nicktriggleon Twitter The government says it hopes to make Covid a manageable disease like flu.  Vaccination and new treatments, ministers and their scientific advisers argue, will reduce the death rate and allow us to live with the virus rather than constantly trying to fight it. Why are they doing this? And is it even possible? Wiping Covid from the face of the Earth would, of course, be great given the death and destruction it has caused. But the only problem with that is that eradication has only been achieved with one virus before - smallpox in 1980.  It took decades to get to that point, and scientists and governments were only able to achieve this because of a pretty unique set of circumstances. Firstly, the vaccine was so stable it didn't need to be refrigerated, and when it was given it was immediately obvious whether it worked or not - a pustule developed. It was also clear when someone was infected - a lab test was not needed, which was a huge advantage in trying to contain outbreaks.  Covid, as we are all too well aware, is completely different. Instead, the so-called ""Zero Covid"" movement tends to talk about elimination. This basically means reducing cases to or close to zero in a territory and keeping them there. One of the most high-profile advocates of this strategy is Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert from Edinburgh University. She believes we should treat Covid like measles, which has been largely eliminated in rich countries. She argues that continued restrictions to get cases really low, coupled with a more effective test-and-trace system and vaccination, could mean we could keep it suppressed, allowing the UK to get back to a ""somewhat normal domestic life"" with restaurants, bars, and live sport and music events all possible.  But the price to pay, she says, would be border restrictions curbing international travel and ""short, sharp lockdowns"" when cases did inevitably flare up. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, a clinical epidemiologist at the University of London, is another advocate of this strategy. She is one of more than 4,000 signatories of the Zero Covid petition, which is calling for a parliamentary debate on the proposal.  ""Life could return to something like normal - we could even open travel corridors with other countries who have gone down that route,"" she says. It maybe a tantalising prospect, but one that many believe is out of reach or would require such sustained restrictions that the economic and social costs would be huge. ""Zero Covid is not compatible with the individual rights and freedoms that characterise post-war democracies,"" says Prof Francois Balloux, director of University College London's Genetics Institute. Countries like New Zealand, Taiwan and Australia have achieved this because they were able to prevent the virus getting a foothold - and all the signs are that once their population is vaccinated, they will begin to lift border restrictions. But no country which has seen the virus spread in the way it has in the UK has actually managed to then suppress it to the point of elimination. Vaccines in theory provide a new tool to help us achieve that, as they have for measles. But there is a significant flaw with this argument, says Prof Jackie Cassell, a public health expert from the University of Brighton. Measles, she says, is an ""unusually stable"" virus. This means it does not change in a way that allows it to evade the effect of the vaccine. In fact, the same jab has essentially been used since the 1960s - and it also provides lifelong immunity. It is already clear this is ""sadly"" not the case for this coronavirus, says Prof Cassell. The variants that have emerged in South Africa and Brazil allow the virus to change to evade some of the immunity built up by vaccines. The virus circulating in the UK has also mutated further to gain the key change - known as E484 - which allows this to happen. As more people are vaccinated, this is only likely to increase. That's because mutations that are able to get around the immune response in some way will have a selection advantage, says Dr Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who has carried out research on global outbreaks from Zika to Ebola. ""We cannot get away from that. We may well need vaccine updates."" The challenge therefore is to ""keep ahead of the virus"", he says. But this is not, he believes, as hard as it perhaps seems given the media attention on the new variants. Coronaviruses change less than flu, he says, which means the vaccines should still remain effective to a large extent.  What is more, the fact that the mutations that are being seen share some key characteristics gives us a good idea of the route they are going down. ""You would expect it to be easier to update than it is for flu, where there are lots of different strains."" Although he warns utmost care must be taken at the moment as a population that is building immunity at a time when there is a lot of infection around provides an ideal breeding ground for variants to escape those vaccines. He says it is too early to tell if we will get to the point where coronavirus can be treated like flu as we are yet to fully see the impact that the vaccines will have. Such caution is understandable, as scientists want to see the evidence from the real world rollout of the vaccination programme first. A major study is under way from Public Health England looking at this - and it is expected to be published before restrictions are lifted. But all the indications from the clinical trials and the experience of Israel, which is leading the world in terms of vaccinating its population, is that they will have a significant impact on infections - and where they do not, they will at least help prevent serious illness and its lasting ""long Covid"" complications as well as deaths. For those who remain susceptible either because they refuse vaccination or the jab has not worked, advances in treatments that are being seen will be vital. It suggests we can get to the point - in the word's of England's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - where we ""de-risk"" Covid. That does not mean no-one will die. Prof Whitty has talked about getting to a ""tolerable"" level of death. And certainly many expect next winter will be challenging with particular concern the most deprived communities will be hit hardest amid fears vaccination uptake has been lowest in these areas. But it is easy to forget that flu can also kill on quite a scale. Back in 2017-18, more than 20,000 people died from it. It was a harsh, cold winter and deaths from other causes such as heart disease and dementia rose too, pushing excess winter deaths close to 50,000. Society barely blinked.  ""We have lived alongside viruses for millennia"", says Prof Robert Dingwall, a member of the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Group. ""We will do the same with Covid.""

Mr Ashford said while staff working at the previous facility ""did the best they could with the clinical area they were given"", the new mass vaccination centre would be ""much more efficient"". ""Newlands is an outbuilding at Noble's, there wasn't the ability for social distancing as such, and there wasn't the ability to push through the throughput. It was very limited,"" he said.

Inside the Glasgow lab sequencing coronavirus,"By Lisa SummersScotland Health Correspondent It would ordinarily be things like flu, zika or feline calicivirus that keep the scientists at Glasgow University's Centre for Virus Research (CVR) busy.  Their combined expertise in human and veterinary medicine looks at emerging diseases in all corners of the globe. But since last February, the centre has largely focused on the global response to coronavirus. Hundreds of projects are ongoing, ranging from investigating SARS-CoV-2 in cats to the monitoring of long Covid or looking at the body's immune response to the virus. Some of the most significant research comes as part of a consortium carrying out rapid genomic sequencing of coronavirus - tracking new variants and monitoring the significance of changes. Their research determined that foreign travel was the instigator of the first and second wave here in Scotland. Prof Massimo Palmarini, director of the CVR, said: ""At the beginning most of the cases coming in were all associated with individuals who had been travelling and had picked up the virus somewhere else and brought it to Scotland so that is quite relevant in trying to think to avoid a third wave for example."" That's why, they say, quarantine measures and travel restrictions are important. The scientists say it is for governments to decide how quarantine is carried out but it may be necessary for some time while there are still high rates of transmission in many parts of the world. Prof Emma Thomson, an expert in infectious diseases, is playing a leading role in sequencing SARS-CoV-2. She said: ""That is potentially a very major threat to our health. We certainly don't want to generate new variants and export them either so we need to look at public health measures to keep the virus under control and to protect the vaccine.  ""We have a good early warning system with the sequencing but other countries don't have that so they may not be aware of the variants that are being generated and so therefore areas that have very high rates of transmission are the ones we will need to keep an eye on for a long period to come."" The genomic sequencing going on here is hugely significant not just for Scotland, but for the global scientific community. To get one step ahead, the academics need to work quickly to understand where new variants have originated and how they are evolving. The sooner worrying mutations are identified, the more quickly control measures can be put in place. Prof Thomson says they are already planning tweaks in vaccines and the genomic information they gather here will help to inform what those changes are.  But while the vaccine programme continues at pace in the UK, other countries are not so fortunate. ""We must make sure that it is not possible that new variants are arising in countries that have weaker, less well-funded health care systems where vaccinations are maybe more difficult to use in that context so we do have a global responsibly to help other countries to protect themselves and us,"" Prof Thomson says. ""We can certainly expect that we will reimport variants if we don't look at a global level at vaccination that's obviously important for equality reasons across the world but also because we can't isolate ourselves on this island."" The experts based here in Glasgow don't want to put any dates on a return to normality, but Prof Palmarini at least sounds optimistic when asked.  Prof Palmarini said: ""The first thing I would say as a scientist is that we are not the only ones who can predict this because there are so many factors that come into play so I think I would refrain to give you a date.  ""But what is important to consider is that as time passes and more and more people will be protected, we will be in a situation where we will be able to manage the disease.""

'I caught Covid twice and worry I'll get it again',"By Emma Clifford BellBBC Scotland The Nine A Scottish care worker has revealed how she caught Covid twice within seven months. Michelle Lamont, from Ardrossan in North Ayrshire, tested positive for the virus in April 2020. But the 50-year-old was ""stunned"" when routine testing picked up the infection again in November. After becoming ill for a second time, she is now concerned about the possibility of suffering the debilitating symptoms again. Walking her dog along the beach at Saltcoats, Ms Lamont shared her fears with BBC Scotland's The Nine programme. She said: ""I was devastated when I tested positive for the first time,"" she says. ""If I can get it twice, what's to say I can't get it a third time? That plays on my mind."" The first time around, Ms Lamont was exhausted and did not return to work for five weeks. ""It was just horrible. I've never felt so ill in my life,"" she said. ""I had a slight cough and a temperature but the headache was the worst. It was like a migraine, it just didn't go. The palpitations were really hard because it felt like a weight on my chest.  ""It was just a horrible feeling. I had no focus - I couldn't even watch television or listen to music and I had no appetite."" The mother-of-three said she worried more for her family than for herself. She said: ""My oldest daughter, Courtnay, wore PPE and she looked after me. ""I was scared. You're just lying thinking what if I've given this to my family? I've got vulnerable family members as well and I was thinking I'd never forgive myself."" After several months of negative PCR tests and feeling well again, it was ""an absolute shock"" to be told of another positive result.  ""I remember I got tested on a Friday. I felt ok and I had no symptoms at all,"" she said. ""On the Saturday at about 19:00, Public Health Scotland phoned me and said sorry, but you're positive. ""I burst out crying because I thought - I can't go through that again."" Michelle was in the middle of preparing dinner for the family and getting ready for work but had to immediately go back into self-isolation. After several days, Michelle gradually became unwell again.  She said: ""The headache was there and it wouldn't go this time. I had the temperature, the fatigue and the palpitations came back. This time it lasted around 10 days."" She now wants other people to know that it is possible to be re-infected. ""I didn't realise it could happen again and that's with taking all the right precautions. My doctor, she was stunned. People are in denial that it can happen again. They look at you as if you're daft. They don't believe you but yes, it can."" Ms Lamont says she feels lucky to be well again and is looking forward to getting some normality back. She said: ""I just want an end to this, like everyone else. If people follow the rules, I'm very hopeful."" Experts warn some people do catch Covid-19 again - and can infect others. A recent study led by Public Health England (PHE) found that most people who have had Covid-19 are protected from catching it again for at least five months. Past infection was linked to around an 83% lower risk of getting the virus, compared with those who had never had Covid-19, scientists found. However, the new coronavirus has not been around long enough to know a lot about how long immunity lasts. PHE's ongoing study on immunity in healthcare workers found 44 potential re-infections in a group of 6,614 people who had previously had the virus. Researchers conclude reinfection is uncommon but still possible and say people must continue to follow current guidance, whether they have had antibodies or not. Scientists from Hong Kong recently reported on the case of a young, healthy man who recovered from a bout of Covid-19 only to be re-infected more than four months later. Using genome sequencing of the virus, they could prove he caught it twice because the virus strains were different. Asked if it was aware of any cases of re-infection, Public Health Scotland said it was looking at possible Covid-19 reinfection and planned to publish a report in due course.  A spokesman added: ""It is too soon to draw any conclusions as to what the findings of this report will be."" Can you catch Covid twice?

Optimism as Cuba set to test its own Covid vaccine,"By Will GrantCuba correspondent, BBC News Some of the equipment at the Finlay Institute of Vaccines in Havana might be considered outdated elsewhere in the world but the science taking place behind its white-washed walls is cutting edge. Researchers are working long shifts on Cuba's best shot to solve its coronavirus crisis: Soberana 2, the island's domestically-produced Covid-19 vaccine.  Soberana (Spanish for ""sovereign"") 2 is a conjugate vaccine - meaning an antigen is fused to a carrier molecule to bolster the vaccine's stability and effectiveness.  Within weeks, it will be tested on tens of thousands of volunteers. The results from the first clinical trials were ""encouraging"" and ""very important"", says the institute's director, Dr Vicente VÃ©rez Bencomo, and the Communist-run government hopes to give the vaccine to everyone on the island by the end of the year. ""Our plan is to, of course, first immunise our population,"" explains Dr VÃ©rez at a news conference. ""Moving to commercial production of Soberana 2, we're planning to have in the order of 100 million doses during 2021 and we will dedicate an important part of these doses to the full immunisation of the country."" It is an ambitious goal but a realistic one as Cuba has more than 30 years of experience in biotechnology and immunology.  In the late 1980s, Cuban scientists produced the first meningitis B vaccine and the then-leader, Fidel Castro, opened the Finlay Institute partly with a view to finding ways around the decades-old US embargo on the island.  If patents from US pharmacological companies would not be available to Cuba, it would find its own solutions in that field, he reasoned. However, it remains beyond the island's production capacity to make 100 million doses of the vaccine without some form of international assistance.  Still, even if the US government under President Joe Biden reverses the hard line former President Trump took towards Cuba, the US will not play a role in producing Soberana. ""Our main contacts are with Europe and Canada and we have people participating from Italy and from France,"" Dr VÃ©rez explains, adding that ""unfortunately"" at this point there is no US participation.  ""We hope in the future it will be possible to move to the next step in co-operation,"" he says.  International bodies like the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) hope that Cuba will become the first Latin American country to produce its own vaccine. ""We're very optimistic,"" says PAHO's representative in Cuba, Dr JosÃ© Moya. ""We've been kept informed since the pilot phase of Soberana 2 and during the experimental trials, and we've known that Cuba has been investigating the viability of several vaccines since August last year."" The stakes for Cuba are high. Firstly, its own Covid-19 statistics are worsening by the week.  Confirmed cases recently climbed to more than 1,000 a day for the first time since the pandemic began. While those figures are tiny compared to those in Mexico, Brazil and the US, they are  still serious enough to place additional strain on Cuba's creaking healthcare system. By the middle of last year Cuba had largely contained its outbreak through a combination of an aggressive public information campaign and the closure of its airports. In July and August, there were several consecutive weeks of minimal transmission and very few deaths. But cases have gradually crept up again, much to Cubans' frustration. Dr Moya of the Pan-American Health Organization says the situation is not out of control and mirrors that in other countries. ""There came a moment in all our countries when you had to start to reopen. And that's what happened here, as they tried to progressively move towards the so-called 'new normal'."" But Cuba is currently experiencing its worst economic outlook since the end of the Cold War so there is also an  important economic incentive to a successful vaccine.  The coronavirus lockdown has been very painful for an island so dependent on tourism with the economy contracting a whopping 11% last year. Long lines form every day outside food shops and supermarkets as people queue for basic goods.  The government has chosen this moment to implement a number of overdue reforms, from unification of Cuba's tangled dual currency system to some liberalisation of self-employment licences.  While those steps may eventually strengthen Cuba's troubled economy, they spell short-term pain for many families, especially those without relatives sending remittances from abroad. Cubans are very resilient and resourceful - they have had to be to face the twin challenges of US sanctions and the state's overbearing control. But many are exhausted at the relentless months of coronavirus restrictions and the grinding economic hardship.  With children still out of school, businesses going bust and a curfew in place across Havana, people long for some encouraging news about vaccination. A viable vaccine would allow the island to reopen sooner and with more certainty than before. Soberana 2 would also generate some much-needed income if exported around the region. It all places real urgency on the scientists working on it, not only to alleviate the island's health crisis but its economic one, too.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-56069577,1
First travellers arrive for hotel quarantine stay,"The first travellers required to stay at quarantine hotels have begun arriving in the UK. All British and Irish citizens and UK residents who arrive in England after being in a high-risk Covid country now have to self-isolate in hotels.  The ""red list"" of 33 countries includes Portugal, Brazil and South Africa.  The new regulations, which aim to stop Covid variants entering the country, apply to arrivals who have been in one of those places in the past 10 days.  They have to pre-book and pay Â£1,750 to spend 10 days in government-sanctioned hotels. The cost covers the hotel stay, transport and testing. In Scotland, the rule to stay in a hotel applies to travellers arriving directly by air from all countries outside the Common Travel Area (the UK, Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands) - rather than just those from the list of 33 countries. One traveller newly quarantining at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel near Heathrow Airport said he was ""feeling sad"" at the prospect of isolating for 10 days. Roger Goncalves, 23, from Belo Horizonte in Brazil, said: ""I did my test for coronavirus. The test was negative. Why do I need to stay in my room for 10 days?"" Mr Goncalves, a delivery driver who lives in London, flew into the capital from Sao Paolo, via Madrid in Spain because he needed to come back to work. He said the Â£1,750 cost of his stay was ""too high"" and ""crazy for 10 days"", but described his room as ""not bad"" and said he had been told food will be left at his door. Meanwhile, Zari Tadayon, 66, from north London, faces spending her birthday in isolation after flying in from Dubai, via Frankfurt. Asked how she felt about spending 10 days in isolation, she said: ""I feel horrible because I live here, I have my own individual home, and also I have some medical issues which I was hoping they would consider. ""I'm not prepared. I didn't bring books and stuff."" She added that she wasn't feeling happy ""because tomorrow is my birthday and I would have wanted to be with my family... those are the rules, what can you do?"" In Scotland, the first passenger to go into quarantine hotel was Chun Wong, an American medical worker, who had travelled from America to Edinburgh via Dublin with his eight-year-old daughter Kiernan - to join his wife in Fife. He told the BBC he would do ""whatever it takes"" to stay, adding: ""Even though I got my Covid shot already, whatever it takes to make everybody safe."" However, he and his daughter were later allowed to leave the hotel after it was realised that as they had arrived from the US - which is not on the red list - via Dublin, which is in the Common Travel Area, they were allowed to isolate at home instead. The government has defended the arrangements after questions were raised about the ability of passengers from ""red list"" countries to mingle with other travellers on flights and at airports before being moved to their accommodation. A spokesman said: ""Separation cannot always be easily implemented at airports, but every step is taken to reduce risks and to minimise any potential for passenger interaction, including Covid-19 tests prior to departure and routine protocols like mandatory mask wearing, social distances and regular cleaning of facilities. ""A number of airports, including Britain's busiest airport, Heathrow, have introduced additional measures to segregate passengers from red list destinations ahead of the immigration hall to limit the possibility of mixing."" Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told Times Radio the hotel quarantine system had been operating ""smoothly"" since it came into force at 04:00 GMT on Monday. Meanwhile, Heathrow said in a statement that the measures had come into effect ""successfully"", and it would continue to monitor whether Border Force had adequate resource and processes ""to avoid unacceptable waiting times and compromising the safety of passengers"".  It comes after the airport warned of delays caused by the rules. Are you travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" location? Tell us by emailing haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Heathrow Airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough. Passengers arriving at London's Heathrow Airport on Monday were escorted by security personnel to coaches, which took them to nearby hotels, including the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel. At Birmingham Airport, there were just four flights touching down on Monday, including a plane from Istanbul with about 100 passengers, some of whom are believed to be from a red list country. The government says it has struck deals with 16 hotels so far, providing 4,963 rooms for the new quarantine system, with a further 58,000 rooms currently on standby. People travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination has any direct international flights. Any passenger required to stay in a quarantine hotel in England needs to reserve a room online in advance using a government portal. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is Â£650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is Â£325.  Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Asked at a No 10 briefing on Monday what would happen if someone staying in a hotel had to extend their stay due to a positive test, Prime Minister Boris Johnson stressed it was currently illegal to travel abroad for holidays and that people going into quarantine should be able to ""cover their costs"". A new testing regime for all travellers arriving in England has also started, with two tests required during the quarantine process. They will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers Â£210. Those who do not take the tests could face a Â£2,000 fine. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the nation had decided to adopt stricter rules ""because we think it is important to go as far as we can"". At her daily Covid briefing, she also stressed a common approach to travel restrictions across the four nations of the UK would be ""preferable"" and she said Scottish ministers would try to persuade the UK government ""to adopt more comprehensive measures"". Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see ""a stronger set of defences at our borders"" and described the UK government's measures as ""the bare minimum of what needs to be done"". Last week, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to ""go further"" on border quarantine measures. Travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. And all travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK. Lockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons.

What are the new quarantine rules for Scotland?,"By Claire DiamondBBC Scotland Since Monday, those arriving in Scotland from outside the Common Travel Area (which includes the rest of the UK and Ireland) must isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel.  Passengers have to pay Â£1,750 to quarantine in a room at one of six designated hotels - in a bid to stop new cases of coronavirus being imported.  BBC Scotland has been looking for answers to some of our readers' most-asked questions...  Yes - those flying into Scotland from outside the Common Travel Area from Monday 15 February must stay in a quarantine hotel for 10 days from arrival.  Everyone who arrives must provide proof of a negative Covid test taken in the three days before you travelled. And you will be tested again twice during the 10 days of isolation. Being vaccinated does not change the rules you will be expected to follow, as scientists do not yet know for definite what effect vaccines have on the transmission of coronavirus.  That means that although the vaccine stops you getting severely ill, you might still catch and pass on the virus. If you fly into England from a country which is not on the red list, you do not have to stay in a quarantine hotel.  Instead, you can isolate at home for 10 days - even if that means travelling to your home in Scotland.  You will still be tested for coronavirus twice, on day two and day eight of your stay. The Scottish government has said it will continue trying to persuade the UK government ""to adopt more comprehensive measures"" which would require more arrivals to stay in quarantine hotels.  But the UK government has said it believes the current approach is ""proportionate"".  No, it's Â£1,750 for the first traveller in a room, Â£650 for an additional adult or a child over 12, and Â£325 for a child aged 5 to 12. The money covers your hotel stay, food and drink, transfer from the airport to the quarantine hotel, security and two Covid tests.  You might be eligible to pay for quarantine in 12 instalments over a year.  You can apply to the UK government for a deferred payment plan if you are receiving income-related benefits.  There's the option to do this when you are booking your managed quarantine.  If you select this option, you won't be asked for your payment details but you will be contacted afterwards to set up the repayments.  No, you can't choose which hotel you stay in.  The Scottish government has block booked 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports.  You pay for your managed isolation online ahead of travelling, and when you come off the plane you will be escorted from border control by security to baggage reclaim and on to pre-arranged transport to the quarantine hotel. Yes, if he flies into Scotland from Norway he will have to isolate in one of the quarantine hotels. While offshore oil and gas workers travelling to Scotland to work here do not need to enter managed isolation (they still have to isolate, but can do so at their own accommodation and are allowed to leave to undertake essential work), those who have been working elsewhere and are not coming into Scotland for work must stay in managed isolation - as would anyone else arriving in Scotland who does not qualify for an exemption.

"Be 'optimistic but patient' on Covid, urges PM","People must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said. The PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to ""relax"". He said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions. The government said on Sunday that it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose, according to the latest government figures. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the ""unprecedented national achievement"" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"".  The prime minister warned that the government did not have all the ""hard facts"" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK. ""We have to keep our foot to the floor,"" he said. Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown ""to be the last"", with ""cautious but irreversible"" progress. He added his plan next week would set out ""as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain"". Although he said he was ""increasingly optimistic"" he admitted he could not give ""an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties"". ""I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year. ""I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the ""acknowledgement"" would give late night businesses ""the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time"". ""But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,"" he added. Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in.  Who knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well. That's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation. It comes after more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend, calling for a commitment to a ""free life"" and the ending of lockdown measures before May. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. Earlier, No 10 said the intention was to ""start getting"" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages. The PM's official spokesman said it was ""important"" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday. The spokesman said he would not ""pre-empt"" what the road map might contain, but added: ""It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows."" The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said. This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose. All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination.  With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as ""two sprints and a marathon"". He said the UK had passed the ""finishing line of the first sprint"" and now had a ""second sprint between now and 30 April"" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups. The ""marathon"" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added. Meanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.

Fifty heritage groups receive Covid recovery money,"Fifty heritage organisations and 41 individuals will benefit from Â£5m in coronavirus recovery funding. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said it would help stabilise the sector and prevent the loss of important historical assets. Self-employed tour guides and specialists such as stonemasons will benefit from the funding.  Individuals will receive a total of Â£195,000, with the average award being Â£4,750 each. The Heritage Recovery Fund is being delivered by The National Lottery Heritage Fund on behalf of the Department for Communities. The Â£5.28m is part of the department's Covid-19 Culture, Languages, Arts and Heritage support programme. Grants from the fund will help many venues, sites and attractions to adapt and safely reopen again once lockdown restrictions are eased, the department said. ""It will also save many heritage jobs and skills from being permanently lost,"" it added. The communities minister said self-employed individuals working in the heritage sector were being supported ""in recognition that many have been unable to work during the pandemic"".  Titanic Belfast and SS Nomadic are set to get a Â£1.63m grant and National Trust NI will benefit from a Â£324,500 grant.

Lower jab take-up by BAME NHS staff 'a concern',"Lower proportions of black and Asian staff at a hospital trust have come forward to have a Covid-19 vaccine, according to a study. The analysis found 70.9% of white staff at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust had received the jab, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff. This could have ""major implications"" for vaccine roll-out, the report said. A union said it was important to understand ""any reasons for hesitancy"". The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, was co-authored by Prof Kamlesh Khunti, a diabetes expert from the University of Leicester who is also a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). The trust, where 36% of staff are from minority ethnic backgrounds, has been running vaccination hubs for staff at each of its three hospital sites. The report - which covers the period from 9 December to 3 February - found 12,278 staff from a total of 19,044 had come forward to have a jab since it was offered in mid-December. Further analysis of the South Asian group found a much lower take-up among Pakistani and Bangladeshi healthcare staff (43.2%) than the Indian cohort (60.3%). However the rate between Black Caribbean and Black African staff was quite similar. The study also noted a lower take-up among staff under 30. Staff in this age range made up 18.7% of the vaccinated group compared with 31.7% in the group who had not come forward for a jab. The report said: ""These findings give significant cause for concern, as ethnic minority groups (especially those working in healthcare) are at higher risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2 [coronavirus] and adverse outcome from COVID-19, yet are not taking up this critical preventative intervention. ""Furthermore, healthcare workers are an important source of health information for ethnic minority communities and so our findings may also have implications for vaccine uptake in the population at large."" The authors called for the findings to be ""acted upon urgently to prevent the disparities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic from being allowed to widen further"". Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""We need to understand the reasons as to why there is hesitancy amongst people from BAME communities, so that it can be properly addressed.  ""Some reasons we've been told include misinformation about the virus and vaccine, mistrust in health interventions more generally, and some people have said they want to wait until there is more certainty about the safety and efficacy of vaccines."" Sara Gorton, Unison's head of health, said: ""Encouraging vaccination for all is the key to getting us out of this crisis. It's important to have as much understanding as possible about any reasons for hesitancy.  ""Health workers gather information from many sources, so it's vital to ensure those they turn to are correct. ""NHS staff also need to be given time to ask vaccination teams about their concerns, talk to those who've had the jab and think things through. It can't just be a one-off opportunity."" Dr Habib Naqvi, director of the NHS Race and Health Observatory, said the organisation was ""deeply concerned that vaccine uptake for Covid-19 is lower among black and minority ethnic hospital staff"". ""Amongst those most at risk of dying from Covid-19 are also those that are most vaccine-hesitant,"" he said. ""More needs to be done to mediate and ensure accurate information, based upon facts, is targeted in culturally appropriate ways, to reach those who need the vaccination the most."" University of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community.

"Covid-19 related deaths in NI hit 2,000","The Department of Health's Covid-19 related death toll in Northern Ireland has reached 2,000, after four more deaths were reported on Monday.  It means the total number of deaths has doubled since December, after reaching 1,000 over two months ago.  A further 234 cases of the virus were also announced. This brings the total number of positive cases to 109,147. There are 477 Covid inpatients in NI hospitals, with 59 in intensive care. There are 79 care home outbreaks. Health Minister Robin Swann said it must not be forgotten that ""behind every death will be a family left in grief"". ""While we are seeing good progress in the rollout of our vaccination programme we must remain cautious and cannot be tempted to get ahead of ourselves,"" said Mr Swann. The reduction in transmission needed to be sustained in order to ""preserve life and support our health service"", he added. The latest figures from Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout show 397,243 people have received the first dose. A total of 29,005 people have received both the first and second jab. It comes as those who received a shielding letter because they are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable can now book vaccinations over the phone. The online booking system went live on Friday. Appointments are available at Northern Ireland's seven regional vaccination centres. Patricia Donnelly, the head of Northern Ireland's vaccination programme, has urged anyone who is eligible to make an appointment to do so without delay. Those who have already been contacted by their GP for vaccination are advised against booking a slot.  A lockdown began in Northern Ireland on 26 December with schools closed along with non-essential shops. The NI Executive is to review coronavirus restrictions on Thursday. It is thought unlikely the lockdown will be eased before Easter, with Health Minister Robin Swann already hinting at this in a previous paper to his executive colleagues. Officials say with St Patrick's Day and the Easter holidays around the corner, they do not want to prematurely allow more opportunities for people to mix, which would likely lead to another rise in cases. The executive is yet to decide if some or all pupils can return to school on Monday 8 March. The Public Health Agency (PHA) has said schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus. The comments were made in a PHA presentation to education officials and some school principals last week, seen by BBC News NI. Northern Ireland's reproduction (R) number, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading, has fallen from a peak of about 1.9 in the community last month to about 0.75-0.85. On Monday is was announced Northern Ireland is to get a further Â£300m from the UK government to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic.

Cummings defends Covid contract to polling firm,"The government's decision to hire a firm with links to the PM's ex-chief adviser Dominic Cummings has been challenged at the High Court. Campaign group The Good Law Project has complained of ""apparent bias"" in the decision to recruit Public First for Covid-19 opinion polling last year. During a hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer argued emergency rules used to award the work should not have applied.  But Mr Cummings said the Â£540,000 contract had been ""entirely justified"".  In a written statement, he said although he was ""friends"" with the company's founding directors, he had not recommended them for that reason. He added there had been ""no time"" to follow usual procurement rules, and the work was ""crucial"" to the government's early pandemic response.  Public First was founded by James Frayne and Rachel Wolf, whom Mr Cummings said he knew from previous roles both inside and outside government.  According to a November report into Covid-19 contracts by the National Audit Office, it was initially hired ""on an informal basis"" in March 2020 to do focus group research. The spending watchdog added the company was then given a ""retrospective contract"" in June, covering work from March and ""potential future work"".  The Cabinet Office's decision to award the work under emergency tendering rules is subject to a legal challenge from The Good Law Project.  At a High Court hearing on Monday, the group's lawyer Jason Coppel QC told judge Mrs Justice O'Farrell that ""no other provider was considered"" for the work. He added that although other firms already working for the government had been able to bid, ""no thought was given to any other provider because Dominic Cummings wanted Public First to have the contract"". Arguing that rules allowing the ""direct award"" of contracts did not apply, he added awarding the contract without open competition had not been ""strictly necessary"".  Mr Cummings, who was working as Boris Johnson's senior adviser at the time the work was awarded, did not give evidence in person during the hearing.  But in a written statement, he defended his decision to recommend the firm for the work.  He said he was friends with both Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf, as well as ex-civil servant Gabriel Milland, who is also a partner at Public First.  He said he had not met Mr Frayne since 2016, and had ""no involvement"" in the ""contractual arrangements"" with the firm.   ""Obviously I did not request Public First be brought in because they were my friends. I would never do such a thing,"" he added.  He said he had recommended the firm because he knew the company was ""very good"" at running focus groups, and he could ""rely on them to make an extra effort"". Although he added he was not allowed to ""direct"" civil servants, he said he expected Public First to be hired ""as a result of my suggestion,"" adding that he was an ""expert in the interaction between policy, mass communication and focus groups"".  ""Civil servants could have disagreed and did disagree with my suggestions all the time, and my response depends on my expertise of the matter in hand and other circumstances."" ""On this occasion, I was an expert,"" he added.  Arguing for the legal challenge to be dismissed, lawyers for the Cabinet Office told the judge Mr Cummings made a recommendation, not a decision, on awarding the work. Representing the Cabinet Office, Michael Bowsher QC said Mr Frayne and Ms Wolf had ""professional and personal connections"" with Mr Cummings, as well as Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove. But it was ""emphatically denied"" that there was ""any bias, or apparent bias"" in the award of the work to Public First, he added. He said: ""At a time of national emergency Dominic Cummings recommended a firm he knew could get the job done."" He added Mr Gove did not have any involvement in the decision or influence it in any way. In an outline argument earlier this month, government lawyers said it was ""clear"" that the conditions for allowing emergency procurement rules to apply had been met. They said the research Public First had been hired to do was required ""immediately,"" and there was ""no time to conduct even an accelerated procurement exercise"".  Former Labour MP Natascha Engel, who is now a partner at Public First, defended the firm's involvement.  Speaking after the hearing, she said: ""Given James Frayne hasn't spoken to Dominic Cummings in several years and neither he nor Rachel Wolf spoke to Dominic Cummings or Michael Gove about Covid research, the idea this was some sort of quiet arrangement between friends is clearly wrong."" ""Everyone in government knows which research agencies can deliver in a crisis, and it's no surprise Public First was chosen given our record.""  Having heard rival arguments, Mrs Justice O'Farrell said she would deliver a ruling on a date to be fixed.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56073038,1
Covid vaccine rate can now 'fly' in Wales,"The roll out of the Covid-19 vaccine can now ""fly"", the doctor in charge of Wales' programme has said. Dr Gill Richardson added ongoing studies were looking at whether the immunisations would become regular and routine, similar to the flu jab. It comes as figures show one in four people in Wales has received a vaccine. Dr Richardson said vaccine supply would increase in March and, by April, there would be ""levels of supply that we haven't hitherto seen"". ""We will have more than enough vaccines to give the first doses to all of those who require it,"" she said. Dr Richardson added that the infrastructure put in place to immunise the population took ""slightly longer to build"" but now that it's in place the process could ""fly"". ""You've seen how incredible the NHS efforts have been in delivering that vaccine and we have nowhere near maximized our capacity to immunise,"" she said. ""We would have wanted that Oxford-AstraZeneca in every general practice and every pharmacy in the land that would like to give it and the supply has constrained that ability, but we will be rolling out to more and more in that sector."" It is expected the Moderna vaccine, the third Covid vaccine approved in the UK, will bolster vaccination supplies later in the year. In the meantime, the number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall over the next fortnight, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres. Dr Richardson also said several studies were looking at what immunisations may be needed in future. ""It could be that it's just certain clinical risk factors or age factors that will mean that those people have to have it. ""Ever since we started this program we've always had an eye for what is the sustainability route for this course of immunity."" Dr Richardson said it was difficult to establish the full impact of the vaccination programme while the country was in lockdown, but suggested early signs were positive. ""On a UK basis, it looks like the death rate for those in the vaccinated cohorts is decreasing which is really encouraging news. The rate of deceleration is faster than the rate of deceleration for those in younger groups, so that's a really good sign."" But she stressed that lockdown rules must be adhered to in the meantime as there was uncertainty whether the vaccine interrupts transmission. Leading statistician Prof Jennifer Rogers said there was a sharper drop in deaths of those aged 90 and over compared with those aged 50 to 59, who had not been vaccinated. ""It definitely suggests that it is not an anomaly,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford said on Sunday that everyone aged 50 and over will receive a first dose by the end of April. Those aged 80 and over were in the groups that were the top priority to get vaccinated first. Prof Rogers, who is a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said older people ""make up 10% of cases but 80% of deaths"". Across England, she said there had been a 35% reduction each week for the past fortnight in the number of deaths among people aged 90 and over, compared with a 22% drop among people aged 50 to 59. In Wales, a total of 784,809 people have been given their first dose of vaccine, according to the latest figures, which is 24.9% of the population. The over-70s, care home residents and staff, health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable have already been offered the jab. There is a similar prioritisation of vaccine rollout in England, where Boris Johnson has said he would set out a roadmap next week providing a ""route to normality"" to move England out of lockdown. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Wales' reduction in Covid-19 transmission showed lockdown had worked. But, he told a press conference on Monday, it was ""harder to tell"" what impact the early stages of the vaccine roll-out was having on case rate numbers. He said vaccines ""will help to protect people when there is some more mixing"". An updated roadmap out of lockdown in Wales is due to be published by the Welsh Government on Friday. On Sunday, Mr Drakeford said the government will prioritise the return of three-to-seven year olds to school, along with some older children on vocational courses. Ministers have started ""cautious"" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter. People in Wales largely support remaining in lockdown for longer if it means avoiding the ""emotional rollercoaster"" of going in and out of tighter restrictions, according to an academic. Simon Williams, senior lecturer at Swansea University's school of management, told BBC Radio Wales people were not ""overly optimistic"" of restrictions easing significantly because they had been ""burned in the past."" Mr Williams said surveys from Public Health Wales (PHW) suggested as many as a quarter of people would be willing to stick to tighter restrictions for up to a year if it meant greater freedoms afterwards. ""So people are remarkably willing to stick in lockdown as long as it takes."" Asked about a vaccine passport, of those people who had received the vaccine, Mr Williams said he believed ""the vast majority"" would be comfortable carrying ""proof of immunity"". He added it was ""inevitable"" for a vaccine passports to play a role in international travel in the future. The proportion of people who have so far refused the vaccine is ""negligible"" and a ""very, very small proportion"", according to Dr Giri Shankar, PHW incident director for Covid-19. He told Radio Wales the first dose is ""offering a level of protection"" and that ""all indications are suggestive of an improving picture"", but added it was important people received their second dose when called upon. Fielding questions from listeners, Dr Shankar urged people who had previously been ill with Covid-19 to accept the vaccine. If people who are in the top four priority groups had not been contacted about a vaccine, Dr Shankar said they should contact their local health board. All information is available on a dedicated Welsh Government website, he added. Wales 'first in UK to hit February vaccine target' How do the coronavirus vaccines in Wales work?

Third of social care staff 'still not vaccinated',"A third of social care staff in England have not had the Covid-19 vaccine, the health secretary has said, despite them being among the groups prioritised.  Matt Hancock said it was ""very important"" for the staff, patients and society that they get the jab. Meanwhile, a hospital trust has revealed that only 36.8% of its black staff have had the vaccine. Everyone in the top four groups has had a jab offer and 15 million people have had a first dose, the government says. The rollout in England has officially been expanded to those aged 65 and over and younger people in at-risk groups. In a bid to encourage more social care staff to have the jab, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""It is the right thing to do. It is very important that you come forward and take up this vaccine. It's important for you, it's important for your patients and of course it's important for the whole of society.""  Analysis from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust has revealed lower proportions of black and Asian staff being vaccinated. It found that 70.9% of white staff had come forward, compared with 58.5% of South Asian staff and 36.8% of black staff. University of Leicester Hospitals NHS Trust said: ""The data is two weeks old and three in four Leicester hospital staff have now been vaccinated, with uptake rising across all ethnic groups, and others taking up the offer of a jab in their local community. We want everyone to get the jab when they are called to do so."" Are you a social care or NHS worker who has yet to be vaccinated? Email: haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged those eligible to receive the vaccine to come forward. ""These jabs, these vaccines are safe, they are efficacious, they will help protect you against disease and against death and they're a wonderful thing to have - they help protect you, your family, your neighbours,"" Mr Johnson said. Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said he would be talking to clinical leaders from various ethnic groups ""to work out together how we can encourage everybody to take up the vaccine"". Christina McAnea, general secretary of the trade union, Unison, said getting as many care workers as possible to have the Covid jab should be achieved through ""encouragement and persuasion"". She said care workers must be provided with ""the correct information"" and ""time to ask the experts about their concerns, think things through and talk to colleagues who've had the jab"". The uptake among care workers isn't surprising - they tend to come forward in lower numbers for the flu jab. It illustrates the need to continue reaching out to those who have not taken up the offer. The fear is some of the most vulnerable and deprived communities have the lowest levels of uptake, which would widen inequalities in the future. Today, though, marks an important milestone. But that is all it is. Most Covid deaths have come in the over-70s, but just over half of hospitalisations have. It means there are a significant number at risk in the 50 to 70 age group as well as younger adults with health conditions. They have been promised a jab by the end of April. Achieving that will not be easy. From March people will start needing second doses, which means the rate at which first doses are given is expected to tail off. As always, everything depends on supply. Ministers are confident in the supply of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines and by Easter the deliveries of a third jab made by Moderna should arrive. There can be no let up. Meanwhile, Mr Hancock said that there was still ""some way to go"" before easing lockdown. He said: ""At the latest count there are still over 23,000 people in hospital with Covid - that's more than in the April peak.""  It is 69 days since the UK began its mass vaccination programme - and six weeks since the prime minister set out the pledge to offer a first dose to the four priority groups by 15 February. That meant vaccinating all elderly care home residents and their carers; everyone over 70; all frontline health and social care workers; and everyone with a condition that makes them extremely vulnerable to the virus - a total of 14.6 million people. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing Mr Johnson hailed the vaccine rollout as an ""unprecedented achievement"" and said the country can go into the next stage ""with great confidence"". But while the UK's vaccination rate is third in the world, behind only Israel and the United Arab Emirates, there have been reports that some people in priority groups - including those who are housebound - are still waiting for their first dose. And a small number of the 15 million people vaccinated will have been outside these initial priority groups as some NHS regions had already begun giving jabs to younger people. As well as the over-65s, the next group to be offered the vaccine is the estimated 7.3 million people aged 16 to 65 with a range of health conditions that put them at risk from the virus. The rollout will then be extended to the remaining over-50 age groups, with the aim of offering a first dose to another 17.2 million people before the end of April. Meanwhile, the government has confirmed that millions of people whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the vaccine. Mr Hancock said that 90% of the over-70s had accepted the vaccine and one in four adults were now starting to receive protection against Covid-19.  The Department of Health said 88% of the UK's coronavirus deaths occurred in the priority groups who have now been offered the vaccine. On Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend. With the expectation that increasing numbers of people will be protected from serious illness, ministers will this week finalise plans on how England's coronavirus measures can be eased. The government has said it will take ""cautious"" steps, rejecting calls from Conservative MPs to commit to abolishing all Covid-19 restrictions by the end of April.

England's highest case rate town a 'huge concern',"A town's Covid infection rate, ranked the highest in England, is ""hugely concerning"", the council has said. Corby in Northamptonshire had the highest rate in the country in the week up to 10 February, at 383 per 100,000. The rate is dipping but the county's director of public health Lucy Wightman said cases in the over-60s were not falling as quickly as they would like. An advice booklet calling on residents to ""stand together by staying apart"" is being delivered to homes this week. In it, Corby Borough Council leader Tom Beattie writes: ""At this time, more than ever, we all need to come together and take action to ensure that we can drastically reduce the number of rates in the borough to ensure that Corby is not left behind when the rest of the country finally looks to relax restrictions. ""We are calling on all of our residents to please strictly adhere to the regulations by staying at home, only making essential trips out, working from home where possible, wearing masks, not socialising outside of your household or support bubble, isolating immediately if you have symptoms and getting tested."" Ms Wightman added: ""This has an impact on our county hospitals, where pressure remains high in intensive care and on the NHS in general. ""While case rates remain high, the process of easing restrictions and returning to normality could take longer and have a more severe impact on the local economy, and on the lives of individuals living and working in Corby."" The booklet sets out the current regulations, including information on self-isolation, support bubbles, support for businesses and how to get to work safely. Up to 23 January the town had 558.5 cases per 100,000. It decreased slightly a week later to 486 but the decline was not as sharp as elsewhere in England, which meant Corby had the second-highest rate in the country. Corby's Conservative MP Tom Pursglove has described the town's rate as ""stubbornly high"" and called for mass population testing. Mr Beattie, a Labour councillor, has previously stated that the number people continuing to go to work, particularly in manufacturing, was a cause for concern.

Ireland to set up 37 Covid-19 vaccination centres,"The Republic of Ireland is setting up 37 Covid-19 vaccination centres, with at least one in each county. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said there would be five vaccination centres in Cork, four in Dublin and two each in Kerry, Tipperary, Westmeath, and Wicklow. So far, 6,000 vaccinators have been trained. Up to 12 February, 175,238 first doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered. A total of 89,999 second doses have also been given. It means 1.8% of the Republic of Ireland's population has been vaccinated so far. On Monday, 821 further cases of the virus were announced in the Republic, but there were no further Covid-related deaths. Mr Donnelly said the country was still in the early stage of the vaccine rollout. He said Monday marked the start of vaccinations moving to the general population with those aged over 85 up first. ""People can expect to see these vaccination centres ready and waiting in their county,"" the health minister said.  ""We have always said the vaccination programme would only be limited by the availability and reliability of supply in these early stages of the programme.  ""In the coming months supply will increase substantially and we will see these centres operating to full capacity and administering vaccines to the general population, following the government priority list.""  Vaccines are currently being administered in healthcare settings and by GPs. Now many people will be offered their vaccination in one of the 37 centres after registering online.

Future lockdowns in Wales not ruled out,"A return to lockdown in Wales cannot be ruled once the current restrictions are lifted, the health minister has warned. Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK government's plan to move England out of lockdown would be ""cautious but irreversible"".  But Vaughan Gething said ministers would have a ""responsibility to act"" if there was an upswing in the virus. A revised plan out of Wales' lockdown, which began in December, is expected in the next few days. Welsh cabinet ministers are considering the latest scientific evidence this week before any changes to restrictions are announced on Friday.  But First Minister Mark Drakeford has suggested any initial easing may be limited. He said at the weekend that ""cautious"" talks had begun on Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter. The Welsh Conservatives called for consideration to be given to a reopening of gyms, while Plaid Cymru said easing lockdown should be based on data, rather than dates. Mr Johnson is due to announce his road map for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. He added: ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see."" At Monday's press conference, Mr Gething warned there was a ""danger"" of setting out ""absolutes"" by talking about whether lockdown lifting was ""irreversible"". ""If we make cautious steps outwards, then it will still very much feel like a form of lockdown for most people, because we're not going to be returning straight away to what we thought of as our normal lives just over a year ago.  ""So yes we don't want to see a return to having to introduce more restrictions, but I wouldn't say we can give a cast iron guarantee that would never happen.""  Mr Gething said if a number of restrictions were removed but there was then a ""significant upswing"" in the virus - such as a new variant - then ministers ""would have a responsibility to act"". He added that the majority of people would rather see lockdown rules continue until it is safe to ease them. Ministers are looking at ""small things"" to ease out of lockdown, he said, but would not speculate on what measures were being discussed.  Meanwhile, Mr Gething said the next stage of the vaccine programme began on Monday. He said appointments would be offered to people aged 65 to 69, people aged 16 to 69 with an underlying health condition, younger adults in residential care and unpaid carers. An expected drop in the supply of vaccines to Wales will not delay anybody's second dose appointment, he added. The Welsh Government's lockdown easing roadmap has to be ""built around data not dates"", said the Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. ""That's absolutely critical, so you can't set an arbitrary date"", he said, adding there should be a ""phased step by step approach rather than all at once"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was right to be cautious over easing lockdown restrictions, but he hoped gyms could be reopened ""in an organised manner"". ""I'd like to see some sort of consideration around gyms being allowed to come forward in an organised manner so that people can look to those avenues to help them with their well-being"".

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  People must be ""optimistic but patient"" about the coronavirus situation in the UK and the end to restrictions, Boris Johnson has said. In a government briefing, the prime minister hailed the ""achievement"" of the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to relax. He said he would set out a roadmap next week, providing a ""route to normality"" to move England out of lockdown - but he could not guarantee that this would be the final one. It comes after No 10 said it had hit its target to offer a jab to the UK's 15 million most vulnerable people. The first travellers required to stay at quarantine hotels have been arriving at Heathrow Airport today. All British and Irish citizens and UK residents who arrive in England after being in one of 33 high-risk Covid countries now have to self-isolate in hotels. The new regulations, which aim to stop Covid variants entering the country, apply to arrivals who have been in a ""red list"" country in the past 10 days. One traveller newly quarantining at the Radisson Blu Edwardian hotel near Heathrow Airport said he was ""feeling sad"" at the prospect of isolating.  Roger Goncalves, 23, from Belo Horizonte in Brazil, said: ""I did my test for coronavirus. The test was negative. Why do I need to stay in my room for 10 days?"" People whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the Covid vaccine, the government has confirmed. Those with the condition will not get the jab earlier unless they are formally shielding, regularly take steroid tablets or have ever had an emergency hospital admission. Previous guidance indicated steroid-inhaler users would be eligible - but it has since been judged this group is not at increased risk of death. The Department of Health and Social Care said it was following independent advice that the immediate priority should be to ""prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality"". Asthma UK is calling for people with non-severe asthma to be given the jab after the first nine priority groups have been vaccinated. There appears to be some positive news emerging about one of the Covid vaccines currently being used in the UK. More data from Israel's vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic infections. This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger population as it did in the clinical trials. It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai Levine. He said experts ""still don't know what the impact is on transmission"" but can say, at least, ""the vaccine is useful for personal protection"". Blackburn with Darwen Mayor Iftakhar Hussain has resigned after breaching lockdown rules by visiting a house where police said people were ""celebrating a wedding"". He was one of nine people who were fined by Lancashire Police after being found at an address in the town on Saturday. Mr Hussain said he regretted the ""momentary lapse of judgment"", adding that he ""should have known better"". In a statement, he said he believed resigning was ""the right thing to do"", as he no longer believed he could ""continue to serve as mayor to the best of my ability"".

Birthday party attendees ignored lockdown,"Partygoers who defied Covid-19 restrictions and travelled across the country to celebrate at a 30th birthday party have been fined by police.  Officers found nine people at a buffet with alcohol and disco lights when they broke up a party in Swindon, Wiltshire. Aged between 23 and 35, they were found celebrating at a property in Rutland Road, Park North on Saturday and were each given Â£200 fixed penalty notices.  Two of the guests had travelled from Nottingham to attend.  Wiltshire Police said it issued 54 fixed penalty notices between 8 and 14 February, making a total of 571 since the pandemic started.  Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said a ""significant number of people"" were still ""ignoring"" the government's lockdown rules.

He tweeted about the sighting, prompting excitement among twitchers. Five were fined for travelling to the town to photograph the bird after Devon and Cornwall Police were contacted on Saturday over the lockdown breaches.

Self-isolation support 'not working' in England,"By Rob EnglandBBC News ""Patchy"" financial support for people self-isolating in England has left many workers in hardship, unions have said. Figures suggest about 70% of applications for a Â£500 government support scheme were rejected as of 6 January. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has called for statutory sick pay to be increased and made available to all workers. The government said it was ""monitoring the effectiveness"" of the support. Councils in England are responsible for processing applications for the NHS Test and Trace Support Scheme, with money allocated from central government. Figures obtained by the TUC suggest about 58,000 applications were successful out of about 190,000 in England - with large variations across the country. Overall, 232 authorities out of 314 responded to the organisation's Freedom of Information request. Some councils such as Rochford in Essex and Torridge in Devon granted more than 70% of applications, while Oxford City Council granted fewer than 10%. The TUC said this suggested a ""postcode lottery"" existed within the scheme. Susan Brown, leader of Oxford Council, said the authority had become ""increasingly concerned"" with the high number of rejected application to the main fund, saying the criteria were ""very restrictive"". ""A high number of people we think could benefit from this payment are not eligible, and so are having to be turned down,"" she added. If a person tests positive for coronavirus or is asked to self-isolate for another reason, they can apply for a Â£500 support payment via one of the scheme's two funds. Applicants must meet certain criteria to be eligible. The main fund is available for people who are unable to work from home and are receiving a form of benefits. The discretionary fund is available for those not receiving benefits but who will suffer financially by self-isolating. Domiciliary carer Jan Simons, from Blaby in Leicestershire, caught coronavirus in November, and was living on Â£95 a week statutory sick pay while self-isolating. The 64-year-old was refused any form of support payment because she was not on benefits and because she had just been paid and had Â£900 in her bank account. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, she said: ""I [felt] let down because I love my job, and I think I do a good job... but I was just turned down [for the payment] and that was it."" Her daughter, Ria Spilling, said help for her mother, ""a key worker on the front line"" during the pandemic, ""just wasn't there"". Sam Griffiths, from Leeds, was initially turned down for the support payment, causing the musician, who also works in a pub, to become anxious and depressed. ""It was heartbreaking,"" he told BBC Newsnight. ""Everything that could have gone wrong felt like it was going wrong."" The council refused the 28-year-old's application after saying his bank statements proved he had not been self-isolating, when actually he had been ordering food to be delivered to his home. ""I was furious because I thought I'd done my part by staying inside,"" he added. Leeds City Council apologised for the error and Mr Griffiths later received the payment. The TUC also asked how much of their initial funding for the scheme councils had used. Of the councils running the main scheme, for those receiving benefits, 36% used all allocated funding, with some spending over - though this will be reimbursed by the government. Blackburn with Darwen Council spent about Â£327,000 on the main scheme - more than triple its initial funding of Â£86,000 - after granting three quarters of applications. A spokeswoman for the council said the high percentage of families receiving benefits had increased eligibility for the scheme. Many councils running the discretionary scheme also spent more than their initial grant, with 17% exceeding it. Hull City Council spent more than four times its initial Â£100,000 fund by granting fewer than half of applicants the Â£500 payment. A spokesman for the council said it saw a high number of claims, due to many residents being in employment which did not provide income when self-isolating. He added the council had taken a ""pragmatic approach"" by not introducing additional eligibility criteria - which would reduce costs but make the process longer and more difficult for applicants. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said the current system of ""patchy"" self-isolation payments was ""not working"" and the scheme faced a funding shortfall, causing some councils to be conservative with funds when considering applications. ""Too many low-paid workers are going without the financial support they need to self-isolate,"" she said. ""This is a gaping hole in the UK's public health approach."" The TUC has instead recommended statutory sick pay, available for people too ill to work, be raised from the current Â£95.85 per week to ""at least the real living wage"" - about Â£330 per week. Since the period covered in the TUC's request, the government has provided an additional Â£20m to local authorities to cover the cost of the scheme, including Â£10m for the discretionary scheme - bringing the total funding up to Â£70m. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said the government was working with councils in England to monitor the scheme, including any impact on groups who were currently ineligible for it. ""The government will be providing further funding for the scheme in the coming months,"" he added.

"Funeral held for 'lovely' identical twin, 96","The funeral has taken place of a 96-year-old identical twin who died after contracting coronavirus. Doris Hobday and Lilian Cox, from Tipton, West Midlands, were admitted to hospital in January after testing positive for Covid-19.  Mrs Cox recovered but Mrs Hobday died on 5 January. Her surviving twin said she would always remember her sister, adding: ""We never had no arguments. She was like me - lovely."" ""She will always be in my heart, Doris will, and in my mind, she will always be there. We have done so much together, making people happy and all that.""      Mrs Cox joined family and friends at a church in Tipton to remember her sister. A small group of people watched their arrival and there was applause as her coffin entered the church. Mrs Hobday was buried next to her husband Ray, who died 11 years ago, and who, along with a half-pint of Guinness, was ""her favourite thing"". The siblings were among the UK's oldest living twins, and appeared on national television. The pair became popular online with their positive outlook on life and sense of humour. They appeared on BBC Breakfast, ITV's Good Morning Britain and This Morning, charming presenters with jokes about wearing their drawers inside out and their love for actor Jason Statham. Mrs Cox and Mrs Hobday said they did everything together, which included living on the same street after getting married and working together at a brewery in Birmingham. More recently they were living next to one another in Tipton in sheltered accommodation. Speaking to the BBC on their 95th birthday, Mrs Cox revealed her sister's secret to a long life was ""no sex and plenty of Guinness"" - her own being simply ""lemonade"".

Girl's hotel quarantine puts hug with mum on hold,"A family, desperate to be reunited after 16 months apart, will have to wait an extra 10 days before they can be together. Eight-year-old Kiernan Wong and her father Chun were among the first arrivals at Edinburgh Airport on the first day of new travel measures. They had already been held back by a disrupted immigration process. Instead of an emotional reunion, father and daughter were whisked away to a quarantine hotel to self isolate. Mum Danielle has been in Scotland since November 2019. A dual UK/US citizen, she is a front-line worker, involved in the care of people with addictions. But the plan for her husband and daughter to join her in Glenrothes, Fife, was hit by the pandemic. Danielle said: ""Because of Covid, immigration was completely shut down. So what would normally have been a six-month process has turned into 16 months - and a lot of heartache. ""I've missed holidays, I've missed birthdays,"" she said. ""And then on top of that both Chun and Kiernan both contracted Covid, so watching that from Facetime and not being able to be there was extremely difficult."" Both parents agree that the rules must be followed and both understand the reasons for them. But they are frustrated that after waiting for so long, and being asked to arrive before 3 March to collect visas, they ended up arriving on day one of travel quarantine. All arrivals must isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel in Scotland. In England this only applies to people from 33 ""red list"" countries. Danielle said: ""I think what is frustrating and what needs to be remembered is there are visa processes in place. ""This wasn't a choice, they had to come by a particular date or the visa would be null and void. Unfortunately, their date of arrival was the date that this started. "" However, she accepts what has to happen. ""Theoretically, another 10/11 days is a drop in the bucket for how long we have had to wait. But I can't wait to give her a hug. It's been too long."" Chun and Kiernan have settled into the hotel room that will be their fist experience of Scotland as well as their home for the next 10 days. He and his wife have had to pay about Â£2,500 for the stay, on top of about Â£10,000 in immigration fees. Travellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels have to pay Â£1,750 each, plus an extra fee for additional isolating guests for their managed quarantine. Chun, who worked in healthcare in the US, also accepts the process is necessary. Even though he was fully vaccinated in America. He said: ""The one drawback is that the expense is a little much, but you do what you have got to do to keep everyone safe. I understand it's better to be safe than sorry. ""It sucks that we have to be here another 10 days and it's coming out of my pocket but these are lives we are talking about here."" And Keirnan is also taking it in her stride. ""I am kind of upset that I can't see my mum,"" she said. ""But I am kind of ok because at least we are in Scotland now."" Chun told reporters at the airport he would do whatever it takes. He said he was preparing to play a lot of board games with his daughter and might teach her poker before the family is reunited on 26 February.

Plan to end lockdown 'cautious but irreversible',"The government's plan to move England out of lockdown will be ""cautious but irreversible"", Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister is due to set out the roadmap for ending restrictions next Monday. He told reporters the plan would include target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. It comes as a group of Tory MPs call for a commitment to a ""free life"" and ending of lockdown measures before May. Senior backbencher Steve Baker said he wants the prime minister to ""let us reclaim our lives, once and for all"". The PM is likely to be questioned about his plans later when he hosts a Downing Street press conference at 17:00 GMT - alongside England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, and the chief executive of NHS England, Simon Stevens.  On Sunday, the government said it met its target to offer a vaccine to the 15 million most vulnerable people across the UK. Figures on Monday showed a 29% drop in the number of positive cases across the country, down to 9,765 - the lowest figure since 2 October. But there are still concerns over the numbers, with over 88,000 cases recorded in the last week - an average of 157 cases per 100,000 - and 4,598 people dying within 28 days of testing positive for the virus.  Labour said the government must ""lock in the gains of the vaccine"" and ensure more measures were introduced to reduce the spread of the virus - such as financial support for self-isolation and updated workplace guidance.  Mr Johnson and senior members of his cabinet are set to spend the week looking into the latest coronavirus statistics before making an announcement on its plans.  He said: ""The dates that we'll be setting out will be the dates by which we hope we can do something at the earliest."" There has been a raft of speculation on the date of re-openings of businesses and hospitality - much of which has been dismissed by Downing Street. But sources in No 10 told the BBC they were increasingly confident pupils in England would return to school on 8 March - the earliest the PM said the move could happen. Mr Johnson said no decisions had been taken yet, but the March date for schools had ""for a long time been a priority of the government and families up and down the country"". He added: ""We will do everything we can to make that happen, but we have got to keep looking at the data.  ""There are still 23,000 or so Covid patients in the NHS - more than at the April peak last year - there are still sadly too many people dying of this disease; and rates of infection, although they are coming down, are still comparatively high. ""So we have got to be very prudent and what we want to see is progress that is cautious but irreversible. I think that is what the public, people up and down the country, want to see.""  Over the weekend, 63 Tory MPs wrote to Mr Johnson, calling for easing to begin in March and for analysis to be released justifying any measures staying in place. Mr Baker, who is the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should re-open by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine.  The proposal was rejected by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday that the government would be ""cautious"".  But writing in the Telegraph, Mr Baker reasserted his plan, saying: ""As the prime minister said, let us reclaim our lives, once and for all. This can be a moment of unity - for our country and the Conservative Party - as we look ahead with confidence, hope and optimism to a much brighter future."" Fellow CRG member and Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price said the government ""have to think about livelihoods"", telling BBC Radio Essex: ""The moment you open schools up then there is no excuse for not opening up the rest of the economy.""  Hospitality bosses are asking the government to reopen pubs by April, with the chairman of Wetherspoon warning the industry is ""on its knees"" and jobs are on the line. The plea comes after industry figures showed the plight the sector is facing, with a net loss of almost 6,000 licensed premises last year - triple the tally in 2019. More than a dozen MPs have also called on Mr Johnson to allow restricted weddings to return from 8 March, followed by restriction-free weddings from 1 May. Tory former minister Esther McVey said after the top nine groups of people are vaccinated, it should be ""a huge moment for the UK to hold its head up high, for couples to walk down the aisle, and for families up and down the country to reunite, to celebrate and to plan their futures"". Any broad political consensus that existed in the early days of this pandemic has long gone.  The Tory MPs that make up the Covid Recovery Group have been increasingly critical of prolonged restrictions.  This is a group containing some senior Conservatives who are willing to be vocal, and willing to exert pressure on the prime minister. Their stance will no doubt be a factor in Downing Street's thinking.  But it would be wrong to assume lockdown scepticism is representative of everyone on the Tory benches. Of more than 360 Conservative MPs, 63 signed the latest letter to Boris Johnson urging an easing of restrictions as soon as possible. That's not an inconsiderable number.  However, there are also Tory MPs that advocate a more cautious approach, as do plenty on the opposition benches.  The pressure from some in his party to move quickly out of lockdown creates tricky political tension for the prime minister - but it's not necessarily a majority view. Another senior Tory backbencher, Robert Halfon, said the PM needed to ""provide some kind of optimism to the public"" over lockdown easing, but warned against people relaxing too soon. The chair of the Education Select Committee told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour: ""I understand where [the Covid Recovery Group] are coming from and my heart has a lot of sympathy. ""I just don't want a repetition of what went on last year where we thought we were over the worst and then we're suddenly back in tiers of lockdown."" Meanwhile, Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not want to give a ""cast iron guarantee"" about future lockdowns. He said: ""The danger is we try to set out absolutes - with talk of whether this is irreversible, or whether nothing else will happen in the future. ""What we want to do is make choices based on the best available data and information, to see case rates driven as low as possible, and then to have a cautious exit out of the current lockdown we're in.""

Covid vaccine as good in 'real world' as in trial,"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  More data from Israel's vaccination programme is suggesting the Pfizer jab prevents 94% of symptomatic infections.  This indicates the vaccine is performing just as well in a larger population as it did in the clinical trials.  It is proving highly effective at preventing illness and severe disease among all age groups, according to public health doctor Prof Hagai Levine.  ""High vaccination coverage of the most susceptible groups"" was key, he said.  Israel's largest health fund Clalit looked at positive tests in 600,000 vaccinated people and the same number of unvaccinated people, matched by age and health status.  It found 94% fewer infections among the vaccinated group. This was based on test results in people's medical records, usually taken if they had symptoms or were a close contact of someone who had tested positive. And the vaccine prevented almost all cases of serious illness. This pattern was the same in all age groups - including the over-70s, who may have been under-represented in clinical trials. The data has not yet been formally published.  But it ""sends a message to other countries such as the UK"" about the usefulness of the vaccine, said Prof Levine, and the need to get ""very high"" coverage of the groups most likely to become very ill from the virus.  He said he could not put a number on what proportion of the population would need to be immunised before restrictions could ease. ""We still don't know what the impact is on transmission,"" he said.  But we can say that, at least, ""the vaccine is useful for personal protection"", he added. Prof Eran Segal, who is analysing data for the Israeli Ministry of Health, suggested Israel had to vaccinate 80% of its over-60s before learning of its effect on Covid-19 cases.  Israel is the first country in the world to see the impact of its vaccination programme, but it took significant population coverage and several weeks to reach this milestone.  Greater falls were seen in the over-60s who were vaccinated first and in cities that vaccinated their populations earlier - patterns not seen in earlier lockdowns. This provides strong evidence it was the vaccine, and not just the lockdown, driving down cases. But Prof Segal warned falls had happened more slowly than expected, possibly because of the effect of the UK variant, which has become the dominant strain in Israel.  And he cautioned that, even with the ""very rapid pace"" of Israel's vaccination programme, there were still tens of thousands of people who were unprotected and could become severely ill if infected. ""We still have to exit our lockdown very cautiously,"" he said, or risk large numbers of people being hospitalised.  Israel has been experiencing a significant wave of infection and remains under strict measures - but with everyone over the age of 16 now entitled to get vaccine, the hope is at least the education system could be reopened too.  The country has also been met with criticism over questions about who should provide vaccines to the Palestinian territories. Israel has only just also started to transfer some doses to Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, so that vaccinations can begin for front-line health workers. Meanwhile it has given the full two doses to a quarter of its resident population.  Will I need a vaccine passport for work and going out? Will I get side effects from the vaccine?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56069460,1
Five things we still don't know about the vaccine rollout,"By Ben ButcherBBC Reality Check  The government says that 15m people have been vaccinated across the UK. This means just over one in four adults have had their first dose of vaccine but there are some unanswered questions about the rollout.  It appears that uptake in ethnic minority groups is lower than it is for the population as a whole.  This is despite some minority groups, including Bangladeshi and Pakistanis, facing higher coronavirus death rates than white people.  A survey, carried out by the University of Oxford and the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, suggested that black people over 80 were almost half as likely to have had the vaccine than white people over 80.  The gaps are smaller for people in their seventies. This OpenSafely analysis draws data from about 40% of GP practices. There are official statistics of vaccine uptake which show how many people in each ethnic group have had the vaccine, but they are not broken down by age or location.  Normally we would look at how these compare with the overall size of the population, but we don't have much of an idea of how many people are in each ethnic group.  This is because the last census was done ten years ago.  Public Health England has said that supplying transparent data by ethnicity will ""will help to build confidence in the fairness of offer - as will updates on the actions being taken to address inequalities in access or uptake that are identified."" Care home staff were one of the first groups to be prioritised.  But there are no publicly available statistics of how many of England's 1.2m care staff have been vaccinated.  On 15 February, Health Secretary Matt Hancock indicated that around two-thirds of this group had received their first dose, including staff who deliver care in people's homes.  He also indicated that about 80% of England's two million NHS staff had received the vaccine. In Scotland it is estimated that 91% of staff in care homes for the elderly are vaccinated and 83% in Wales. The National Care Forum, a body representing not-for-profit care homes across the UK, found that half of the homes for the elderly which were surveyed had had less than 70% of their staff vaccinated.  The survey, which was conducted on 8-9 February and reached around 1,500 care services, showed that the reason for not having the vaccine was split evenly between vaccine hesitancy, lack of access, waiting for an appointment and health reasons. The government said that the following groups should have been ""offered"" a vaccine by February 15: Leaders have announced that this target has been hit in England, Scotland and Wales. An ""offer"" means you've received an invitation for a vaccine, normally through a phone call, text or letter. Currently, we have no data on how many people have actively turned down the offer of a vaccine or have ignored their invitation for a jab.  We also don't know how many of the 15m people vaccinated are outside of these priority groups.  These numbers would give a clearer picture on whether the target has been hit, and highlight where vaccine hesitancy is high.  For example, data from OpenSafely shows vaccination uptake is higher in wealthier areas, but it doesn't highlight whether the apparent lower uptake in more deprived areas is down to people refusing a jab, or simply not communicating with the NHS. The UK Statistics Authority, which regulates the government's use of statistics, requested this information (as well as data on ethnicity and care staff vaccinations) on 20 January. While we know the government has ordered enough vaccines overall, we do not know the details of when these will be delivered. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has repeatedly said that supply is the ""limiting factor"" in the speed of the rollout. The government expects to have enough supply to give people their second dose within three months, while also ensuring the next priority groups have their first dose. People who have had their first dose have a considerable amount of protection from the virus, but the second dose increases this.  Getting the second dose within three months is not a rigidly set time-frame, says Eleanor Riley, a professor in immunology and infectious disease at the University of Edinburgh.  ""The main concern is that if people miss this twelve-week window for the second dose, there is a danger that they fall out of the system and don't get their second dose at all. This would be very worrying, as the second dose is essential for conferring high levels of long-lasting immunity,"" she says. Currently, just 4% of people who've had their first dose, have gone on to have their second.  This is because the health service has been focused on delivering the first dose. Currently, the government has a list of nine groups who will be vaccinated before anyone else, including care staff, the clinically vulnerable and anyone over 50.  After that, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) will make suggestions on the next priority groups for the government to consider. In January, Vaccine Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that it's his ""very strong instinct... to say, those who through no fault of their own other than their work, have to come into contact with the virus, should be prioritised"". He listed shopkeepers, teachers and police officers as those who might be prioritised next.  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Briton broke Singapore Covid rules to meet partner,"A Briton has pleaded guilty to breaking Singapore's quarantine rules by leaving his hotel room to visit his fiancÃ©e.  Nigel Skea, 52, walked up an emergency staircase to spend the night with Agatha Maghesh Eyamalai, 39, in September. The couple are now married. Eyamalai admitted aiding him. Breaking the rules could bring six months in jail, but the prosecutor has sought a lesser period and fines. Singapore requires people to spend 14 days in a hotel upon arrival. In a district court on Monday, Skea pleaded guilty to one charge of contravening a control order and one of failing to wear a face mask. Eyamalai admitted a single charge of conspiring to contravene a control order. Court documents said Skea had left his room three times. Eyamalai had booked a room in the Ritz Carlton Millenia Singapore Hotel, where he was quarantined. By Suranjana Tewari, BBC News, Singapore Nigel Skea and his now wife were both dressed casually for their court appearance, but as the facts of the case were read out, anxiety became visible on their faces - even behind their face masks.  ""Guilty,"" they both said meekly, when asked for their pleas. The prosecution proposed that Skea be jailed for four weeks and fined S$750 ($567; Â£408) to act as a ""deterrent"" to others who might consider doing the same. The offence was clearly premeditated, the prosecution said, adding that by spending nine hours together the couple had posed a risk to society. The fact that Skea was not wearing a mask when he left his room was mentioned several times. The couple's lawyer admitted that both had committed ""mischief"", but said that this was due to a ""foolish love"" for each other, and the result of a long separation. He asked for a fine and a one-week jail term for Skea ""to give him a slap on a wrist"". While Singapore's hotel quarantine system has been an effective defence against Covid-19, the government has also been clear that it will deal firmly with anyone found breaking the rules. The way the courts deal with these kinds of offences will be watched very closely indeed. The court heard that Skea walked up 13 flights of stairs to spend the night with his fiancÃ©e, who opened an emergency exit door for him. They spent nine hours together. Skea, from Southampton, had also been caught ""loitering in the corridor"" twice, according to the charges.  Sentencing is expected to take place next week.  ""This is a classic tale of two lovers wanting to be together and trying to be as close as possible to each other, but breaching the law,"" the couple's lawyer S.S. Dhillon told the court. Singapore has been been one of the most successful countries in tackling the pandemic. Despite a big outbreak among its foreign workers early on, local infection rates have for months been low. Last June, a group of British men living in Singapore were banned from working there again after breaking lockdown to go on a ""bar crawl"". They were also fined around S$9,000 each ($6,800; Â£4,893).

'Family man' and ambulance worker dies with Covid,"Tributes have been paid to a ""dedicated family man"" and ambulance worker who died after contracting coronavirus. Father-of-three Kevin Hughes is the fourth Welsh Ambulance Service employee to have died after testing positive for Covid. Colleagues said they had been inundated with messages following the 41-year-old's death on Sunday. Mr Hughes, from Valley, Anglesey, leaves behind his wife Emma and three children, Liam, Sioned and Jamie. He is the latest Welsh Ambulance Service worker to have died with Covid-19, following the deaths of call handler Paul Teesdale, paramedic Gerallt Davies, and medical technician Alan Haigh. The ICT service desk analysist at St Asaph had been ill for a number of weeks and passed away at Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor, on Sunday, 14 February. A keen Liverpool FC fan, Mr Hughes joined the ambulance service in May 2017, having previously worked for RAF Valley Search and Rescue operations and Anglesey County Council. Jason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, said: ""Kevin's loss will be felt deeply by everyone here and we extend our deepest sympathies to Emma, Kevin's children and his wider family. ""Our focus will now be on supporting his family and bereaved colleagues at this most difficult time."" Kara Walsh, ICT service desk manager, said Mr Hughes was a ""well-respected"" member of the team. ""The messages that myself and the team have received from across the Welsh Ambulance Service since his death, speaks volumes of how well liked he was,"" she said.

Wales to receive extra £650m from Treasury,"By James WilliamsBBC Wales political correspondent The Welsh Government is set to receive an extra Â£650m in funding as a result of additional Covid-19 spending by the UK Treasury. It brings the total funding transferred from Westminster to Cardiff since the pandemic to Â£5.85bn. Ministers in Cardiff will be able to carry any of the Â£650m not spent by April over to the next financial year. Welcoming the cash, the Welsh Government said it ""comes at the 11th hour"". A spokeswoman said the announcement comes ""just days before we are due to publish our final spending plans for the year"". ""It should also be noted that this is our Barnett [Formula] share of funding allocated to tackle the pandemic in England,"" she added. ""The limited arrangements to carry forward additional funding falls short of the full range of additional budgetary flexibilities we have been seeking, including full access to our own reserve next year."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the extra funding for the Welsh Government was ""on top of all of the other UK Government support packages including the furlough scheme, the Eat Out to Help Scheme and the different business loans"". ""It is important that this funding now gets to the businesses and individuals across Wales as we look to rebuild the UK economy,"" he added. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Steve Barclay, said: ""We have worked closely with the Welsh Government in advance of this announcement to ensure they have the certainty they need ahead of finalising their budget on 16 February."" At the start of January, Boris Johnson was asked to apologise after the UK government wrongly announced that Wales would receive an additional Â£227m of funding. Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts accused the Chancellor Rishi Sunak of ""wilful misrepresentation"" for announcing previously announced funding as new cash. Abolish the Assembly MS Mark Reckless questioned why the Welsh Government says the money comes at the 11th hour ""when they are told it can be carried forward and spent next year?"" The Treasury said rules limiting how much can be spent in the next financial year would not apply to the funding. The Welsh Government also has about Â£655m to spend before the financial year ends in April, only Â£350m of which can be carried over into 2021-22.

Schools not a 'major source' of Covid transmission,"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent Schools - including special schools - are not a major source of transmission of coronavirus, the Public Health Agency (PHA) has said. The comments were made in a PHA presentation to education officials and some school principals last week, seen by BBC News NI. It said that school transmission ""does occur but tends to be small scale"". The Northern Ireland Executive is yet to decide if some or all pupils can return to school on Monday 8 March. On Monday, four more Covid-related deaths were announced by the Department of Health, bringing its total since the start of the pandemic to 2,000. In Scotland and Wales, the youngest primary school pupils are due to go back to class on 22 February. On Sunday, Dr Tom Black, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen on 8 March. But he said it would be a ""big ask"" to reopen post-primary schools on that date. A number of meetings have been taking place between education officials, some principals and union representatives ahead of any decision on schools by the NI Executive, BBC News NI understands. As part of those meetings, a presentation on Covid-19 in schools from the PHA was given. It shows that 190 out of 194 post-primaries have had at least one case of coronavirus in the 2020-21 school year and almost 70% of 792 primary schools. However, the PHA presentation indicated that schools were not a major source of transmission nor a ""major driver"" of the second wave of Covid-19. Instead, cases in schools ""reflect community prevalence"" and as cases fall in the wider community ""we expect to see reducing numbers of positive cases in schools"", said the PHA. While school transmission does occur, the presentation said, it ""tends to be small scale"". According to the PHA, children were less affected by Covid-19 in ""prevalence and severity"". While the agency warns that new coronavirus variants are more infectious in general across all age groups, it said they are not worse in children. The PHA presentation said that non-pharmacological interventions in schools were effective. These include social distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, children kept in class ""bubbles"", cleaning and the circulation of fresh air. Dr Joanne McClean, from the PHA, said that the presentation given to reassure staff at special schools that ""while schools are a source of transmission"" they were not at high risk from working in a classroom. However, she added that the transmission risk in schools was not limited to classrooms, where social distancing and other measures are enforced, but that interactions in and around schools had to be considered. ""We know that schools add to that R rate and we're not trying to argue with that,"" she said on The Stephen Nolan Show. ""We've all been to schools around entry and exit time - it's around the social gathering that takes place after that."" Dr McClean said the risk in classrooms can be controlled by schools and that they had ""done a huge amount of work"" in introducing measures to mitigate transmission. But the ""bit that goes on outside the class"", such as in the morning and afternoon when children are arriving and leaving, is more difficult.  One principal told BBC Radio Foyle that schools should return as soon as possible.  ""Staff are on their knees at the moment,"" said Colin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry. ""Online learning takes an awful lot more preparation, my staff are working from 08:30 right through, some are telling me they are still working at midnight. He added: ""Staff want back to school because the pressure they are under at the moment is tremendous, and I think our children need to get back to school."" Special schools have remained open to all pupils since the start of January but the vast majority of pupils in pre-schools, primary schools and post-primaries have been learning remotely. The National Education Union has previously said that a full return to school by all pupils ""may not be possible for some time"". The NI Executive is expected to discuss the return of pupils to schools at their meeting on 18 February but it is not clear if ministers will make a final decision on an 8 March return at that point.

'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid,"Schools do not appear to play a big role in spreading coronavirus, say UK researchers who have studied teacher and pupil absences during the pandemic.  The University of Warwick team looked at sick days taken because of Covid during the autumn 2020 term in schools across England. Absences matched infection rates in the wider community, with no evidence schools were a major driver of cases.  The prime minister is yet to announce plans for reopening schools. English schools will not return before 8 March, Boris Johnson has said. The Northern Ireland Executive is also yet to decide if some or all pupils can return on 8 March. But in Scotland and Wales the youngest primary-school pupils are due to return on 22 February. Since the beginning of January, when the current lockdown began, primary and secondary schools have offered remote learning for most pupils. Vulnerable pupils and children of key workers have been able to attend for face-to-face learning.  The University of Warwick researchers say the decision on schools must be a political one, balancing the social and educational benefits of letting more children return to the classroom against the potential Covid harms.  Children can catch and spread coronavirus but are unlikely to become very sick with it.  The study was unable to determine whether any infected staff or pupils had caught the virus in the school setting.  Co-researcher Dr Mike Tildesley said: ""We are not saying there is no risk.  ""It's an absence of evidence."" There was continuing uncertainty about the impact reopening schools might have on the pandemic. And a cautious approach was needed, he said. In the study, Covid-related absences were lower in primary schools than secondary.   And there was a significant rise in secondary schools in the South East and Greater London in December, which might be linked to the more transmissible variant of the virus identified in Kent. Dr Tildesley said: ""You could potentially think about doing early years first. ""But this is a political decision."" The Public Health Agency says school transmission ""does occur but tends to be small scale"". Prof Sarah Lewis, an epidemiology expert at the University of Bristol, said it appeared that cases in the community were spilling into schools rather than vice versa, based on the available data.

Meal scheme 'like Christmas' to those in need,"A volunteer-run cooking project is providing regular healthy meals for those in need of support during lockdown. The Wivey Food Project in Somerset has cooked more than 5,000 meals since the project started 10 weeks ago.  Healthy meals are cooked at Wiveliscombe Rugby Club and delivered to vulnerable and elderly people who need help putting food on their table. Rosemary Hutchings, 87, said receiving a delivery was ""a bit like Christmas"". ""I've had several falls and I'm very much housebound.  ""It's a bit like Christmas, it's exciting wondering what you are going to have. It's great,"" she said.  The volunteers are supported by food charity Fare Share, Somerset County Council and local growers. The project also benefits from donations from local residents. About 500 meals per week are produced by the volunteers and head chef Kate Benson has also been offering online cooking lessons to help people prepare their own healthy meals when the pandemic is over.  ""The need is coming at us quite fast. There's a single dad who is home-schooling his children and he got in touch with us because he just said could I have some food, I'm finding it difficult to cope.  ""It's an interesting one to think what would have happened if we weren't here,"" she said.  Volunteer cook Kate Lambert, is a regular volunteer despite suffering from ""long Covid"".   ""Nobody minds that I can only do about three hours then have to go home and lie down. It means I can come and do something useful and feel useful,"" she said.   One of the beneficiaries of the Wivey Food Project is single mother Charlie Adams, 35, who said she would face a huge financial struggle without the support.  ""I think in the pandemic you have got to put pride to one side and say ok, I do need the support, I do need the help,"" she said.  A Somerset County Council spokesman added: ""Anyone in Somerset who needs support with access to food or medicines, or emotional and financial support, can call the Somerset coronavirus helpline on 0300 790 6275, seven days a week, 8am-6pm.""

Pound hits three-year high on vaccination hopes,"The pound has hit its highest level against the dollar in nearly three years, amid rising optimism about an end to lockdown in the UK. It surpassed $1.39 on Monday, while also hitting a nine-month high against the euro at â¬1.147. More than 15 million people have now had their first Covid jab, raising hopes that restrictions can soon be eased and the economy start to recover. Boris Johnson will set out his plan for exiting England's lockdown next Monday. Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING, said: ""[The pound] continues to reap the dividends of a successful vaccine rollout and momentum is building towards a reopening of the economy - probably starting with schools on 8 March."" The UK's main share index, the FTSE 100, also climbed on Monday, rising by 2.6%. On Monday, the prime minister said his plan for exiting lockdown would be ""cautious but irreversible"". He said it would target dates for changes ""if we possibly can"", but he warned high rates of infection could lead to delays. The UK has vaccinated more than 15 million people with a first dose and 500,000 with a second dose, the fastest rollout per capita of any large country. England, which has about 85% of the UK population, also launched a hotel quarantine system on Monday. Passengers arriving from any of 33 ""red list"" countries will have to spend 14 days in a hotel room under new border restrictions designed to stop new variants of the coronavirus. European stock markets were also higher because of optimism about the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines and new fiscal aid for the US from Washington.

Mayor resigns over wedding party Covid breach,"A mayor has resigned after breaching Covid restrictions by visiting a house where police said people were ""celebrating a wedding"". Lancashire Police said nine people were fined after being found at an address on Dukes Brow, Blackburn, at about 21:00 GMT on Saturday. Blackburn with Darwen Mayor Iftakhar Hussain confirmed he was fined Â£200.  He said he regretted the ""momentary lapse of judgment"", adding that he ""should have known better"". In a statement, he said he believed resigning was ""the right thing to do"", as he no longer believed he could ""continue to serve as mayor to the best of my ability"". ""I do not want to make any excuses,"" he added. ""I regret the momentary lapse of judgment - I should have known better and I accept full responsibility for my actions."" Mohammed Khan, the leader of Blackburn with Darwen Council, said he had accepted Mr Hussain's resignation, adding: ""I know he deeply regrets this mistake [and] I would like to thank him for his dedicated service during this difficult year."" Speaking to the Lancashire Telegraph, the Labour councillor had earlier said he had been taking part in a ""remote meeting"" all evening when his uncle called, at about 20:30, and ""asked for some food to be delivered to his house"". ""I agreed to facilitate this by going to the house and letting the food outlet deliver the food,"" he said. ""Once the food was delivered to the house, I remained there while my uncle returned. ""I know in hindsight, I should have left the house... once the food had been delivered.""  He added that he had urged those present to abandon the function once he realised what was happening. Lancashire Police said that officers responding to a report that up to 30 guests would be at the house had ""found nine people inside celebrating the wedding, including two residents of the address"".  A force spokesman said all nine had been issued with a Â£200 fixed penalty notice and the non-residents had been instructed to leave.  Blackburn with Darwen Council's deputy chief executive Sayyed Osman said the mayor stepping down was ""the correct course of action"" and had reinforced ""the council's members' code of conduct, which highlights personal responsibility"".  ""We do not endorse or condone any behaviour that falls outside this code and the coronavirus restrictions,"" he added. Deputy mayor Derek Hardman will take over mayoral responsibilities until a new mayor is chosen in May. Blackburn with Darwen, which was subject to tier four restrictions before the national lockdown was imposed, currently has 16th highest infection rate in England, according to the latest government figures. In the week leading up to 10 February, the area had an infection rate of 263.2 cases per 100,000, down from 354.1 cases per 100,000 seven days before.

Covid-19 rules broken at care home during outbreak,"Staff were not following procedures at a care home experiencing a Covid-19 outbreak, inspectors have said, leaving the risk of infection ""high"". The Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspected Lester Hall Apartments, in Leicester, in December to assess infection prevention control measures. The report, published this month, found not all staff were changing PPE after being in rooms with people with Covid. The care home said it prioritised residents' wellbeing and safety. The inspection report said: ""PPE was disposed of in non-clinical bins, even when clinical bins were available. This meant the risk of infection spread was high."" It also criticised ""poor management, knowledge and oversight about which people and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and when their isolation period was due to end"". ""There was no information on people's doors confirming their Covid-19 status to support staff [to] safely manage their care,"" it added. Other findings reported by the Local Democracy Reporting Service included there not being ""consistently enough domestic staff on shift"" to ensure effective cleaning, and that some staff did not socially distance during their breaks. The report states some improvements were made by the end of the inspection.  Lester Hall Apartments' compliance manager said: ""Despite our best efforts to keep this virulent disease out of our care home, at the end of last year we very sadly had a number of Covid cases."" The manager added they had acted on the recommendations made ""without hesitation"" and the home was currently free of the virus.  A rating was not given due by the CQC due to the visit being a targeted inspection. It was previously told it ""required improvement"".

Husband not guilty of murdering wife in lockdown,"A man has been found not guilty of murdering his wife, just days into the first national Covid lockdown. Anthony Williams, 70, said he ""just flipped"" and strangled his wife Ruth at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen. Williams, of Brynglas, Hollybush, denied murdering the 67-year-old in March 2020, but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility. A jury at Swansea Crown Court took just over five hours to find the retired factory worker not guilty of murder. Williams will be sentenced on Thursday. The trial heard Williams strangled his wife of 46 years on the morning of 28 March after an argument. The defence said Williams had not slept properly for several nights because of worries over coronavirus, money and his health. He told police he had ""choked the living daylights"" out of Mrs Williams. Williams had been suffering from depression and anxiety in the weeks before he killed his wife, the jury heard, and ""just snapped"" and attacked her when she told him to ""get over it"". The attack began in the bedroom of their house at about 07:00 but continued downstairs after Mrs Williams fled. She was found slumped in the porch of their home with a pair of keys in her hand, which the prosecution said showed she was trying to escape. After the attack, Williams went to his next door neighbours' house and told them his wife was dead, telling them to ""call the police, I've killed her"". The jury listened to a 999 call where Williams was heard saying: ""She's dead, I've killed her - we had an argument and I've strangled her. You have to come straight away."" She was taken to the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport where she was pronounced dead. The court heard how - while being driven to the police station - Williams told officers: ""It wasn't murder and I didn't mean to murder her. ""I just flipped, it wasn't me. I wouldn't hurt a fly, it wasn't me, I'm not like that and I don't know what came over me."" The court also head from Williams' daughter Emma, who said she told her father she feared he was ""spiralling out of control"". Ms Williams said her father told her he thought he was going to ""lose the house and not be able to pay the bills"" despite having no mortgage on their house and Â£148,000 in savings. Consultant psychiatrist Dr Alison Witts said she believed Williams' mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring in 2019 and the coronavirus pandemic had made it worse. A pathologist found Mrs Williams died from pressure to the neck and had three fractured bones in her neck.

Hancock 'happy to discuss' quarantine loophole,"The UK health secretary has said he is happy to discuss measures that would close a loophole enabling travellers to avoid Scotland's quarantine. All arrivals must isolate for 10 days in a quarantine hotel in Scotland, but in England this only applies to people from 33 ""red list"" countries. Matt Hancock told the BBC he would discuss facilities for people travelling on to Scotland via England. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she welcomed his offer to talk. Concerns have been raised about the risk of people spreading new Covid variants if they arrive at airports and ferry terminals in England, then travel to Scotland on public transport. However, Mr Hancock told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that anyone travelling to quarantine at home should be doing so by car. He said: ""There are some countries with very, very little coronavirus right now so we're taking a proportionate approach. ""If they've been to one of red list countries then they need to declare that and if they don't, that's an imprisonable offence."" He added: ""Residents in Scotland have to follow the Scottish government's rules on the public health measures. The system we're using is the same across the different nations. They must quarantine by law."" Mr Hancock said he was ""happy to have conversations"" with the Scottish government about providing quarantine facilities for people arriving in England, before onward travel to Scotland. While the main points of the emergency travel legislation in Scotland were known last week, the details emerged at 04:00 on Monday. Edinburgh Airport said a significant number of passengers made the decision not to board a flight from Turkey after arriving at the airport. It is understood only four passengers travelled. Chun Wong and his eight-year-old daughter Kiernan were among the first to arrive in Scotland to stay in a quarantine hotel.  They flew from America to Edinburgh via Dublin. Despite being a medical worker in the States and having both his vaccine doses, Mr Wang will still has to isolate under the new laws. He said: ""I will do what it takes. I am glad I am here and will do whatever it takes to stay."" Mr Wong said he had explained the process to his daughter, who will have to wait another two weeks to be reunited with her mother who is a UK resident and works in Scotland.  The family has been waiting for 16 months to be together in Scotland due to delays with immigration due to the pandemic. They were told they had to collect visas before 3 March and so had to travel. Because they arrived on the day quarantine rules started, the family has had to pay quarantine costs on top of more than Â£10,000 in immigration costs. ""We talked to her about it already,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help get our feet settled here.  ""I'm just glad we have landed and can get settled. Whatever it takes to keep everybody safe, I'm all for it. ""We'll play board games - Guess Who and Uno. I might teach her poker."" Mr Wong said the American side of the quarantine process had been ""pretty screwed up"" but said once they reached Scotland it had been ""pretty smooth"".  Leading human rights lawyer John Scott QC said that both the public and Police Scotland had been put in a ""very difficult position"", and had not been given time to fully understand the rules. He said: ""If the detail of the regulations had been published earlier, and frankly, if the UK and Scottish governments had got their acts together in discussions there could have been far greater clarity and dissemination of what exactly is involved."" Anyone who crosses the Scottish border who has travelled from a non-red list country is ""arguably breaking criminal law"", Mr Scott added. Scottish Labour described the Scottish government's handling of the situation as ""farcical"", while the Scottish Conservatives said the public had been ""caught in a blame game"" caused by the SNP. Travellers who are required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine. This raised the possibility of people looking to avoid the charges by choosing English airports even if Scotland is their final destination. Matt Hancock has previously said passengers arriving in England from ""low risk"" countries would be required to quarantine at home - even if their home was in Scotland - rather than face hotel quarantine at their point of entry. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday that she wanted the UK government ""to work with us"" so that people who are ""destined for Scotland"" via an English airport are required to quarantine near the point of arrival. She added that she had raised the issue with Conservative Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and her ministers, Jeane Freeman and Michael Matheson, had spoken about it with their counterparts at Westminster. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I heard a clip of Matt Hancock on the radio this morning saying he was willing to continue to talk to us about this - and I welcome that. Hopefully we can get some progress in the days to come."" Passengers travelling to Scottish airports must fill out a Home Office passenger locator form, take a pre-departure Covid test and show they have made quarantine arrangements prior to arriving in Scotland. They will then be met by security, taken to baggage reclaim and then on to transport to the quarantine hotel, he said. Edinburgh Airport has criticised the Scottish government's plans, saying they were initially ""lacking in basic detail and knowledge of our operations"" and subject to last-minute changes.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56060220,1
Millions of asthmatics 'must wait for vaccine',"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  People whose asthma is under control will not be prioritised for the Covid vaccine, the government has confirmed.  Sufferers of the condition will not be on the list ahead of their peers unless they are formally shielding, regularly take steroid tablets or have ever had an emergency hospital admission. This appears to be a rowing back from previous guidance indicating steroid-inhaler users would be eligible. It has since been judged this group is not at increased risk of death. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said it was following independent advice that the immediate priority should be to ""prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality"". A DHSC spokesperson said: ""This prioritisation captures almost all preventable deaths from Covid-19.""  People with non-severe asthma are considered by the NHS to be at increased risk from Covid - but not at risk of dying from the virus.  Asthma has also been linked to an increased risk of ""long Covid"" -  an array of different symptoms suffered by some people weeks or months after the initial infection has cleared.  Anyone with the condition requiring a steroid inhaler or tablets will be offered a free annual flu jab. And that's led some people to question why they are being treated differently when it comes to Covid where only oral (tablet or liquid) steroids are considered.  Jeff Hunt, a 50-year-old from Somerset, said his moderate asthma had not required hospitalisation for the condition because he had been ""extremely cautious"" - but that didn't mean his condition didn't put him at risk.  ""I'm really frustrated with the government guidance being so unclear,"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like it makes sense. ""We're all being called for an annual flu jab but now we're being told we're at no greater risk than the average population,"" he added. However, Asthma UK said the government had assessed evidence suggesting people with mild or moderate asthma, even those using high doses of inhaled steroids, were not at greater risk of dying. A study tried to correct for this behavioural effect - the fact people with asthma may have been particularly careful - by only looking at the outcomes of people with asthma who had contracted Covid.  The most severe asthma sufferers will be vaccinated in the fourth priority group if they have received a letter advising them to shield. People with asthma will be vaccinated in the sixth priority group, after the over-65s and frontline staff, if they: The first five groups cover care-home residents and staff, over-80s and front-line health and care workers, the over-75s, ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" people (shielders) and the over-65s. There are nine priority groups in total, which the government says it will offer a first jab to by the end of April - including all over-50s regardless of health status. The next set of priority groups has yet to be laid out. But it is expected to include people with both a wider range of health conditions and in a broader group of occupations, like police officers and teachers.  Sarah Woolnough, chief executive of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said: ""The government have advised people with asthma that they are clinically vulnerable to Covid, throughout the pandemic, leaving many people to believe that they were going to be in priority group six for the vaccine.  ""However, based on evidence that a lot of people with asthma are at no increased risk of dying from coronavirus, it has changed the eligibility for category six, which means many people with asthma no longer fall into this group."" She added: ""The government must urgently communicate directly to people with asthma why it has made this  decision, and explain the reasoning behind it."" The charity is calling for people with non-severe asthma to be prioritised ahead of their peers after the first nine groups have been vaccinated. ""The government's lack of attention, urgency and confused messaging around this issue from the start of the pandemic has caused needless anxiety for people and it needs to be put right,"" she said.

"Pupils still waiting for laptops, charity warns","The drive to enable all pupils to get a laptop for home-schooling is still falling short, a charity has warned. Business2Schools, which distributes refurbished technology to children, said a ""high volume of need"" remains. One teacher said a lot of families are still forced to share one device and the fear pupils' education will be irreparably damaged remains.  The Welsh Government said 128,000 devices had been sent to local authorities with 54,000 more expected. Most children aged between three and seven are due to return to school on 22 February, after the half-term break, but for most others, learning from home will continue.  Last April, the Welsh Government provided Â£3m for laptops and wi-fi devices, but it is claimed some pupils, especially those from poorer families, are still waiting.  In January, the charity Child Poverty Action Group said it was concerned some schools were only offering IT help to children on free school meals. Bethan Jones, assistant head at Queen Elizabeth High School in Carmarthen, said: ""We have a lot of families where there's only one computer, iPad, or mobile.  ""Kids won't be able to learn if they only have one laptop between four of them.  ""One device for each family doesn't really tackle the problem."" Sophie and her sister Lucie are both pupils at the school and struggled with the move to online lessons. ""At the beginning my laptop crashed, which was the only laptop we had in the house, so unfortunately we were working off one iPad,"" said Sophie.  ""There was a lot of clashing of lessons and when you're studying for A-levels and your sister's doing GCSEs, you miss one lesson, and that's a lot of work to miss."" The sisters were given a laptop that was donated to Business2Schools. ""Without the laptop we'd have been behind and potentially our grades would have been affected by that,"" said Lucie. ""We're not the only family that have experienced this. You've got different siblings in different year groups and even different schools,"" added Sophie.

'Hotel quarantine rules will cost us thousands',"Jo Chambers is among travellers planning to return to England and will have to quarantine in a hotel when she does. She is coming from the United Arab Emirates, one of 33 countries deemed high-risk. She and her two children live in the north-west of England, but will still have to fly into London to quarantine. ""You can't book a quarantine hotel in Manchester,"" she told the BBC. ""I just think that's absolutely bizarre."" Government guidelines say travellers from the so-called red list countries must arrive in England at Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham or Farnborough airports. More airports may be added, it said.  They have to pre-book and pay Â£1,750 to spend 10 days in government-sanctioned hotels. The cost covers the hotel stay, transport and testing. Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is Â£650, while for a child aged five to 12, it is Â£325. Arrivals in England face an additional Â£1,200 bill if they test positive for coronavirus, the government says. Ms Chambers will have to pay Â£3,000 for herself and two children, on top of flights which, since she cannot fly into Manchester, she will have to rebook. ""I've no idea what we are going to get for that. Are we all in one room?"" she asked. ""It's not cheap,"" she said. Quarantine in the UAE can be done in your own home and when she and her family caught coronavirus at Christmas, that's what she did. ""We did 12 days in a five-bedroom house over Christmas when we were in quarantine and that was pretty horrific."" It means she is concerned over how much space she will have in a hotel. Tony Edwards flew to Chile in December to spend some time with his wife's family. He says he has stayed for so long because of a lower infection rate in the country, and so is surprised it's on the list of destinations requiring quarantine. ""I understand why they are doing it, but they are using a very blunt tool,"" he said. ""I think they are overreacting. Putting Chile in the same bracket as Brazil is like putting the UK in the same bracket as Russia. It's a four-hour flight from here to Rio."" He will have to find accommodation for himself, his wife and three teenage children. Like Ms Chambers, he has not been told how many rooms he can expect. ""I'm not looking forward to it,"" he said. Karl Feilder is also in the UAE.  His children go to school in UK, but are currently with him and his wife in the UAE, since schools are closed. However, he knows they will need to come back if schools re-open. ""It means my two teenage daughters will be locked in a hotel room for 10 days and I think locking teenagers in their rooms is certainly cruel,"" he said. In the UAE, the pace of vaccinations means his children are both inoculated against the coronavirus, he says. ""I think the solution to this is to allow the kids to go back and allow them to do their hotel quarantine at their boarding school."" Are you flying back to the UK from a 'red list' country?

Small grants return for businesses in lockdown,"Businesses in Guernsey will be able to claim up to Â£2,000 from the States if they have been impacted by lockdown. The small business grants, offered in the first lockdown, will be reintroduced from 15 February. A single payment of Â£1,000 or Â£2,000 will be offered to firms that are unable to trade or generating less than 70% of their normal turnover. The States has also agreed to waive rent for commercial tenants while they are unable to operate. Sectors eligible to apply for a small business grant will mirror those included in the co-funded payroll scheme, such as hospitality and construction. These businesses will also need to employ 20 or fewer staff to apply. The higher grant will be offered to those that operate out of commercial premises, and have overheads of more than Â£500. The self-employed can also apply if their business is run full time and is their main source of income, the Policy and Resources Committee said. An agreement to waive commercial rent fees will also discount mooring fees for fishermen for the period in which they have been unable to trade. The P&R committee said it hoped the move would ""encourage private landlords to consider how they can also support their business tenants while the lockdown is in place"". Deputy Mark Helyar, Treasury Lead for the P&R committee, said: ""We remain hopeful that this will be a shorter lockdown and businesses will be able to resume trading, in stages, sooner rather than later.  ""But clearly there is uncertainty and people are worried, and we want businesses to know we're behind them and we'll do what we can to help viable businesses get through this period so they are in a position to bounce back when the lockdown ends.""

UK's Covid response 'deepening' gender inequality,"Unions, women's groups and charities have asked the UK's equalities watchdog to investigate whether the government broke the law in its pandemic response. The groups claim some of the decisions taken by government are ""deepening inequalities"" faced by women. Their intervention comes a week after a committee of MPs said the government's response to Covid had ""repeatedly skewed towards men"". The government said it had offered ""unprecedented"" help in the pandemic. A spokesman said measures included help for the sectors where women are more likely to be employed, protection for female led start-ups and new childcare support. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission said it had concerns about the ""particularly negative impact it [the pandemic] has had on women"". It added: ""While government focuses on the current crisis we do not consider it appropriate to use our legal powers, but we will be seeking to input into the promised review of the government's response and decisions taken.""  In a letter to the commission, the groups - including the TUC, the Fawcett Society and Save the Children -  suggest the government may have failed to meet its legal obligations to consider the impact of its policies on women. They are asking the commission chair Baroness Falkner to launch an investigation, and urging ministers to carry out equality impact assessments of the furlough and self employment schemes. Frances O'Grady, TUC general secretary, said the needs of women had been over looked ""at every stage of this pandemic"". ""Low-paid women have been excluded from getting sick pay, self-employed women who have taken maternity leave have lost out on vital financial help and women have had to take on primary caring responsibility for children,"" she said.  ""The impact of school closures and childcare has put many women in an impossible situation because the right support has not been put in place."" She added that many had been forced to cut their hours or leave their jobs altogether.  Another signatory to the letter - Anna Whitehouse from campaign group Mother Pukka - said equality had been ""swept off the table as privileged fathers in politics (often with nannies) decide the fate of mothers"". Responding to the letter the government insisted that every department considered the impact of its policies on inequality. ""As we seek to build back better following the pandemic everyone will play a crucial part and we will reflect that in our policy development,"" a spokesman said.  Last week, MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee raised similar concerns in a report which said ministers had ""repeatedly"" failed to consider existing inequalities in the labour market when designing job and income support schemes.  Their report argued that women are more likely to be employed in less secure work, and in sectors that have been shut down during the pandemic. It warned that women had borne the brunt of extra caring responsibilities, putting pressure on working mothers, and that pregnant women and new mothers are at risk of discrimination in a tough jobs market.  The committee also said the government's plans for an economic recovery was too-male focused and called for more training and support for women.

Treasury unveils extra £1.1bn Covid support funding,"The UK Treasury has announced a further Â£1.1bn of coronavirus support funding for the Scottish government. It said this meant Â£9.7bn had now been allocated to Scotland through the Barnett formula since the start of the pandemic. Ministers also confirmed the money can be spent now or carried over into 2021/22. The Scottish government welcomed the funding but repeated calls for devolution of greater borrowing powers. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay said the UK government would continue to give the Scottish government the ""resources and flexibility"" to fulfil its responsibilities and support people, businesses and public services. He added: ""From the outset of this crisis, people and businesses in Scotland have been able to rely on the UK government. ""UK Treasury schemes such as furlough, support for the self-employed and business loans have helped to protect jobs and livelihoods."" The UK government said more than 900,000 Scottish jobs had been supported through the furlough and self-employed income schemes, while Scottish businesses had also received Â£3.4bn in loans. The Scottish government pledged to set out its plans for the new cash within days. A spokesman said: ""This funding is welcome, however late the notification at this point in the financial year, and we will set out to parliament in the coming days our proposals for allocating these amounts as part of our on-going response to the coronavirus pandemic. ""The process again demonstrates, however, the shortcomings of the devolved funding arrangements, where we are only informed of Barnett consequentials long after the UK government's associated policy decisions have been made. ""Moreover, the Scottish government cannot borrow at its own hand to fund spending in response to Covid-19 or support the economy in the way that countries around the world have done.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56070588,1
Council to seek clarity over vaccine supply cut,"Lancashire County Council is to ask the government for ""clarity"" over a cut to Covid-19 vaccination supplies. The NHS said supplies in North West England are being cut by a third to allow areas that have vaccinated fewer people to catch up. The council's Labour opposition leader Azhar Ali said the county should not be penalised for its rollout success. He said it was ""absolutely vital"" the vaccination programme is allowed to ""continue unabated"". The council's chief executive is to write to Health Secretary Matt Hancock to seek reassurances. Nikki Kanani, NHS improvement director, recently told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that vaccine delivery was being changed to address variations in regional vaccination rates.   Ms Kanani said: ""We need to target our deliveries to make sure that they are going to areas where there are more people left to vaccinate in the priority cohorts."" However, Mr Hancock has said Lancashire would get its ""fair share"" in order to meet the mid-February target to give a first jab to the most vulnerable groups, and dismissed ""reports circulating on the internet"". Mr Ali called for the authority to contact the Prime Minister demanding any diversion policy be reversed. He said: ""I want everyone in the country to be vaccinated, but I don't see why the success of the rollout in Lancashire means we should have to forego vaccinations. ""It's our duty as elected members to ensure all people who need this vaccination get it. ""If it is a supply problem then the government needs to address it. If there isn't a supply problem, we need to stand up for people in Lancashire and make sure they get what they deserve."" He then accepted a ""friendly amendment"" from Conservative councillor Charlie Edwards who instead requested that County Hall chief executive Angie Ridgwell write to Mr. Hancock to seek ""clarity"" over the situation. The call comes as Blackburn with Darwen's Director of Public Health said more jabs need to be rolled out in east Lancashire where cases remain high. Professor Dominic Harrison said areas with high transmission of the virus need extra help to avoid further deaths and damage to the economy.

Rail fares to rise by 2.6% from next month,"Transport for Wales (TfW) is increasing some rail fares by 2.6% from 1 March. It said it would fund ""investment as affordably as possible for both rail passengers and taxpayers"". The UK government announced the same planned increase in December with opponents describing it as a ""kick in the teeth"". Rail campaigners said ""Welsh railways face a very challenging few years ahead as a result of the pandemic"". TfW has been nationalised after a drop in passenger numbers during Covid. Peter Kingsbury from pro-rail campaign group Railfuture Wales said: ""Any fare increase above inflation needs to be accompanied by a range of initiatives to encourage the public to start using the trains again. ""These could include special offers to get people to consider using rail for days out and holidays once restrictions are lifted, and the introduction of flexible season tickets to allow commuters to still save on ticket costs if travelling to work less than five days a week."" Last week, the Welsh Government formally took control two-and-a-half years after KeolisAmey won the Â£5bn Wales and Borders franchise contract. Ministers have spent Â£167m to keep TfW afloat due to a loss of revenue during the pandemic. The Welsh Conservatives criticised Labour, which at UK level had opposed the UK government's earlier 2.6% increase but which in Wales is at the helm of the Welsh Government. ""The irony, verging on hypocrisy, shown by Labour over this 2.6% rise in fares for Transport for Wales passengers is shocking - especially with just a fortnight before the new fare structure is imposed,"" transport spokesman Russell George said. In response, a spokesman for economy minister Ken Skates said: ""Changing fares is never an easy decision, but it helps provide the investment for the vital infrastructure and services our economy and our communities need.""  A TfW spokesman said implementing a same price rise with the Department for Transport would ""keep fares simple for people travelling between Wales and the rest of the UK rail network"". ""Rail fares help us to fund our investment as affordably as possible for both rail passengers and taxpayers,"" he said. ""We understand the need to bring people back to public transport when Covid-19 restrictions end and we'll implement a price freeze on some of our rail products such as local Rover and Rangers, local Railcards and our SailRail product.""  He said several cost saving schemes have been set up since 2018 including free travel for children under 11, free off-peak travel for children under 16, and a 10% reduction on fares to and from north Wales.

Sark first in Bailiwick to relax lockdown rules,"Sark is the first island in the Bailiwick of Guernsey to relax the latest coronavirus lockdown measures. The island was put into a Bailiwick-wide lockdown on 23 January following an outbreak of Covid-19 in Guernsey. The Civil Contingences Authority agreed it was safe for Sark to enter stage one of the Bailiwick's exit framework from Monday. It means the island's only school has been allowed to reopen, as well as takeaway services. Non public-facing businesses can also reopen with up to five staff members indoors, or 10 if outside. Sark has not seen a single case of coronavirus since the pandemic began. Currently anyone who arrives in the island from Guernsey must self-isolate for 14 days. The latest statistics show 184 people in Sark have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with a further 44 people having received both doses. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Prince William pays tribute to 'much loved' nurse,"The Duke of Cambridge has paid tribute to a ""much loved"" nurse who died with Covid-19. Estrella Catalan, 52, died earlier this month at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH), where she had worked for 18 years. She had been receiving treatment in the hospital's critical care complex. In a video call with the East of England's NHS leaders, Prince William said his thoughts were with ""all of you who knew her and her family"". Speaking as part of the weekly meeting, the duke said: ""I also want to just sort of pass on my thoughts to all of you and your teams about Estrella Catalan, who I believe was a much-loved member of most of your teams and had been in the region for a long time. ""And I imagine that's hit everyone very hard so I'm very sorry to hear that, and my thoughts from my family are all with all of you who knew her and her family."" In January, the BBC filmed Ms Catalan, an emergency department nurse, as her NNUH colleagues treated her for the disease.  She said she was desperate to get better so staff could help other patients.  The regional director of NHS England and NHS Improvement East of England, Ann Radmore, who had led the meeting of around 35 senior NHS leaders, said the duke's words had been ""very appropriate and helpful"".

"'Put brakes on weddings in pandemic,' rabbi urges","By Harry Farley and Tom SymondsBBC Home Affairs A senior rabbi in London's strictly Orthodox Jewish community has condemned those holding large celebrations, after police broke up a 150-strong wedding party in the area last month.  The BBC has been sent a video of guests dancing at another wedding in Stamford Hill, also believed to be last month.  Research shows the community has one of the world's highest past Covid rates.  ""Weddings should not go on under these circumstances,"" Rabbi Herschel Gluck told the BBC. High rates of Covid-19 in the community have been partly blamed on misleading legal advice that has been circulating in community newsletters, which says celebrations can have ""as many guests as one likes"". Community leaders told the BBC they hope media attention following January's police raid on a wedding at a school in the Stamford Hill area of north London, will have reduced the number of gatherings.  Asking to remain anonymous, a senior source from the community said weddings were widespread apart from on religious festivals and on the sabbath or Shabbat: ""When the custom allowed it, weddings were happening every single night.""  Rabbi Gluck, president of Shromrim, a neighbourhood watch group in Stamford Hill, confirmed: ""Weddings are very central in Judaism.  ""In the Torah the first commandment is 'be fruitful and multiply'.  ""It goes to the very core of the Jewish experience. Therefore there is a great need and a great urge to have weddings - but we need to put the brakes on,"" he said. Legal advice was distributed to thousands of homes in the community and could have convinced some they could continue because it said ""simchos"", or celebrations ""have a communal prayer element"".  One edition, dated 10 December, wrongly said this sort of event ""can have as many guests as one likes"".  Communal worship is allowed under the current lockdown, with strict social distancing.  But weddings are banned apart from in exceptional circumstances, and with no more than six people.  The human rights barrister and expert on coronavirus restrictions Adam Wagner said the advice had ""hit the wrong tone"". ""It was really about getting around the rules rather than keeping to the rules because of the danger of the virus,"" he said. The guidance has since been revised and a senior representative of the strict Orthodox community said the overwhelming majority were making sacrifices every day to comply with the restrictions. Joel Friedman, director of public affairs at the Interlink Foundation, a representative body for ultra-Orthodox organisations, said: ""We have worked consistently throughout lockdown with local authorities to promote the guidance and are all disappointed when we hear about actions that put lives at risk."" Several sources said a large traditional wedding captured in a video sent to the BBC, had taken place in early January with dancing, and little evidence of social distancing or mask wearing. The UK went into national lockdown on 6 January, but even before that large events were banned. After we emailed a representative of a senior figure who appeared to have attended the event, an audio message was circulated on WhatsApp groups in North London warning that the BBC had video of the event.  ""Friends we have to do something here,"" the message said, referring to ""the wedding last month"".  ""This is no joke mail, most of all, we need to kill this,"" it said.  London's ultra-Orthodox community took part in a study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine  which showed it had a past infection rate of 64%, nine times higher than the UK average of 7%.  This means the Stamford Hill community's infection rate is ""among the highest reported anywhere in the world,"" researchers said.  Many families in the community are larger than average and prayer is an important part of the daily routine, with worshippers going to their local synagogue several times a day, increasing the risk of transmission of the virus.  The government has decided not to close places of worship, and in many Orthodox areas they remain open, with prayers throughout the day and evening.   Legally there are no limits on numbers, and though risk assessments should be done, there is no requirement to publish them.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56040572,1
Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Morning morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. People aged over 65 in England - along with younger people in at-risk groups - will be the next in line to be offered their coronavirus jabs after the UK government announced it had hitÂ its initial target for offering the vaccine to the most vulnerable people, including the over-70s, care home residents and staff and front-line health workers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to confirm later on Monday that 15 million first doses have been received across the UK.Â  The UK's latest attempt to stop new variants of coronavirus being importedÂ from overseas comes into force today. Any British or Irish citizen arriving in England from one of the 33 ""red list"" countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at their own expense.Â Failure to comply could result in a fine of up to Â£10,000. Scotland has gone a step further by insisting that anyone arriving from any country will need to go into hotel quarantine.  While most people in the UK say they want to get their Covid vaccine, there are groups out there seeking to exploit people's nervousness about the jab. The BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring has been examining their tactics for the BBC's Panorama programme. It's not just convincing-looking videos of conspiracy theories that are circulating via messaging platforms - research by BBC Monitoring has found a huge increase in followers of social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the pandemic. Read more here about how our volunteer panel was affected by misinformation - and the actions being taken to remove such content from popular internet sites. The Food Standards Agency says there has been a ""concerning rise"" in the number of food businesses operating from people's homes during the various coronavirus lockdowns, with one hygiene expert saying they are ""rank outsiders operating off the radar"", who ""confuse cooking with catering"". Many are failing to register with the authorities, and are therefore not being inspected to ensure they're complying with food hygiene rules. The FSA is urging people to check that whoever is providing takeaway food has a hygiene rating of three or above - and that the business is registered on the official website. One of the things we've learned from the pandemic is that there are lots of different ways to cover your face. And while it's always good to know which one works the best and provides the greatest protection for you and others, the rules on face coverings can also vary from country to country around the world. And now we're also seeing the rise of the ""double-masker"". The BBC's science editor, David Shukman, has been looking at the various options.

Thousands facing op delays due to 'Covid pressure',"More than 9,000 patients in the North East and Cumbria have been waiting more than a year for hospital treatment.  NHS England said as of December, 9,630 patients had been waiting more than 12 months, up from 7,105 in November. But it said despite ""significant pressure"" UK staff carried out six million non-Covid procedures last year. Laura Hunter, whose daughter Rowan's stomach operation to help her feed was cancelled in December, said her family was ""in limbo"". Three-year-old Rowan, from Berwick in Northumberland, relies on a nasal gastric tube because she has difficulties swallowing.  Her mother said it was due to be taken out and replaced with a more manageable feeding tube in her stomach, but the procedure was shelved due to the pressures of the pandemic and had not yet been rescheduled. ""Christmas came and went and we know it's unforeseen circumstances,"" she said. ""I rang the hospital in January and was told the theatres were closed for two weeks and we would be seen as soon as it was possible. ""We are in limbo, the nasal tube keeps getting knocked out and it's not safe when she's in school."" Retired consultant, Dr Shobha Srivastava, 87, from South Shields, has severe arthritis and has waited for more than a year for surgery on her shoulder.  The 87-year-old, who was awarded an MBE for voluntary work for minority ethnic women, said she sympathised with hospital staff. She said: ""I'm in awful pain and worried that if surgery is delayed further my condition will become inoperable. ""It's frustrating, but I do understand that the NHS is overwhelmed.""

'The next train arriving is first for 56 years',"By Peter ShuttleworthBBC News The name may be synonymous with a space on a Monopoly board and its connection to the birth of professional policing - but Bow Street has got its station back. However, it is not the Bow Street near Covent Garden in central London but its namesake near Aberystwyth in mid Wales. For the first time in 56 years, the village was joined to the rail network as the first train stopped on Sunday. The opening was kept low key as Wales is under a strict Covid-19 lockdown. So there was little fanfare when the 09:12 GMT service from Machynlleth to Aberystwyth stopped to pick up passengers at the Ceredigion village for the first time since 1965. It was just a precaution in case any overeager railway enthusiasts had been tempted to break the restrictions for that shot of the first diesel multiple-unit train parked up at Bow Street. ""This is an important milestone for us and we'd have liked to celebrate it more but that is not appropriate and safe at the moment,"" acknowledged Transport for Wales chief executive James Price. The Â£8m project to reopen the station on the Cambrian Line that connects Aberystwyth and Pwllheli to Birmingham and Shrewsbury has been 11 years in the making. The new single-track halt with a park-and-ride is south of the old station. It closed after 101 years in the 1960s Beeching cuts which saw the end of thousands of stations around the UK. The former site now houses a builders' merchant. Bow Street is the first station to open in Wales since Pye Corner in Newport more than six years ago - and other than some new trains, this is the first tangible marker for the Transport for Wales rail franchise. But Welsh ministers and rail bosses hope it is the first of many stations around Wales that are being considered to improve public transport infrastructure. A project to reopen St Clears station in Carmarthenshire has secured Â£4.7m of UK government funding while the Welsh Government wants UK government cash help to build stations at Carno in Powys, Deeside Parkway in Flintshire and Ely Mill in Cardiff. A privately funded Â£30m Cardiff Parkway station at St Mellons has also been backed by ministers in Wales. Four more stations - three in Newport and one at Magor in Monmouthshire - have also been recommended by a Welsh Government-backed commission looking to alleviate congestion on the M4 following the scrapping of a new Â£1.6bn motorway south of Newport. But although Transport for Wales - which runs the Wales and Border rail franchise - is Welsh Government-owned, most rail infrastructure in Wales and across the UK is under Westminster control. ""We have lots of ambitions for reopening a number of railway stations and increasing the number of services but railways are run by the UK government,"" said Welsh Deputy Transport Minister Lee Waters. ""We're stuck in the sidings a little bit. Without UK government stepping up to the plate, we don't have the means to deliver them. ""We've called for extra powers to be given to Wales for railway infrastructure. We are being short-changed by Â£5bn over the next 10 years for the investment we need. "" The UK Government said the Welsh Government can and does invest in station construction and upgrade, in addition to the funding provided Westminster. ""This Government has committed a record Â£1.5 billion to the Welsh railways in recent years,"" added a Department for Transport spokesperson. ""The specification, procurement and management of rail services in Wales is devolved to Welsh ministers and we work closely with them."" Pre-Covid estimates made for the Welsh Government suggested Bow Street station would ""generate"" 30,000 annual trips and take nearly 466,000 vehicle miles (750,000km) off the local road network a year - helping reduce carbon emissions and congestion and parking issues in nearby Aberystwyth. ""The benefit for the amount of money invested here was higher here than anywhere else,"" said Mr Price. With its 70-space car park, bike shelter and 110-yard (100m) platform, the idea is for the station to be a local travel hub to take the pressure off the seaside and busy university town of Aberystwyth less than four miles away. ""Especially at rush hour and peak tourist season traffic is a problem,"" said Aberystwyth Business Club chairman John Glasby.  ""Especially in a tight, cramped town with only two ways in and out - so hopefully a new park-and-ride station on the edge of town might alleviate that pressure on infrastructure and boost local trade. ""The estimate is if you invest Â£8m on local public transport infrastructure, the local economic benefit is three times that - so in this case about Â£24m."" But Mr Glasby, head of commercial services at Aberystwyth University, did say local businesses were ""split"" on whether Bow Street station was ""good value for money"" and could the ""money be better spent elsewhere helping the town"". ""The railway project people in Aberystwyth really want is the reopening of the line to Carmarthen and the south Wales main line,"" he said. ""But that is massive, massive investment."" About Â£755m to be precise, according to a feasibility study published in 2018.  Travelling between Aberystwyth and Carmarthen on the train currently takes about six hours compared with an hour and a half in the car - and the line is one of many across Wales people want to reopen. The Welsh Government states railway infrastructure is the UK government's ""responsibility"" and Mr Waters said it was money ministers in Cardiff Bay ""don't have"". ""I understand the strong wishes to do something to reinstate it,"" said Mr Price. ""But people will also understand that at the minute the significant cost involved."" But Transport for Wales engineers are looking at ""slightly different railway technologies"" to reinstate routes in ""a more cost-effective way"". Some people in the village have previously said they would continue to use the regular and quick bus service to Aberystwyth. So there are a few envious eyes in Bow Street's direction from people who have been campaigning for a station in their village for years. A campaign group at Carno in Powys claim the 27-minute journey between Machynlleth and Caersws is the ""longest stretch of railway in Wales without a station"" - and part of the reason why their station should be the one reopening, more than 50 years after the Beeching axe. ""It's fair to say we were disappointed when it was announced Bow Street would open,"" said Carno Station Action Group secretary John Ellison. ""Especially when other groups like ours have been continually campaigning so hard and have such local support.  ""But, on the other hand, we're heartened to see stations anywhere reopen for communities - and it gives groups of volunteers like us hope to keep campaigning and hopefully one day we will get our station back.""

Another £300m for NI to tackle Covid-19 pandemic,"By John CampbellBBC News NI Economics & Business Editor  Northern Ireland is to get a further Â£300m from the UK government to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic. The money can be spent now or carried into the new financial year in April, which the Treasury says shows ""unprecedented flexibility"". Stormont ministers have been concerned that extra funding they received in December will not all be spent and some may have to be handed back. Funding allocations have become more complicated during the pandemic. Normally Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland get a population-based proportion of new spending for England. In July 2020, the government decided to give the devolved institutions money up front without having to wait for it to be spent in England first. The UK government initially announced a guarantee of an additional Â£12.7bn on 24 July which has now been uplifted four times. Northern Ireland has now been allocated a total of Â£3.3bn in that way. The further funding was welcomed by Finance Minister Conor Murphy. He said he and his counterparts in Scotland and Wales had pushed the Treasury to allow money to be carried into the new financial year. ""I'm pleased flexibility has been granted in relation to this funding which will ensure continued support for the health service, individuals and businesses in the tough months ahead,"" he added.

"Boy, 7, given appointment for Covid vaccine","By Nick JohnsonBBC News A mother has said she is ""hugely concerned"" after her young son was offered the Covid-19 vaccine.  In an email Kim Quinn's son's GP surgery in Holborn, central London, confirmed seven-year-old Jamie Stokes had been booked in for his vaccination.  This was despite children under 16, even those with health conditions, not being in line for the vaccine. North Central London (NCL) CCG described it as an ""isolated incident"" and apologised.  Speaking to the BBC, Ms Quinn said she was surprised when she received the call from Grays Inn Medical Practice in Grays Inn Road, which had booked Jamie in for the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab.  She said: ""The call surprised me and I asked the lady if she was sure.  ""Due to my apprehension, she offered to book me a phone consultation with a doctor to go through any questions or concerns I might have had.""  The surgery then sent an email confirming an appointment for her son, who was born with only one kidney and also has pustular psoriasis which requires regular medication.  Last year, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""This vaccine will not be used for children. It hasn't been tested on children. And the reason is that the likelihood of children having significant detriment if they catch Covid-19 is very, very low."" NCL CCG, which commissions services at Grays Inn Medical Practice, said that if Jamie had turned up for his appointment ""the ID check and safeguards in place at the site would have ensured that [he] was not given the vaccine"". Ms Quinn added: ""I'm so glad I went with my motherly instinct and checked before taking Jamie for his appointment for the vaccine.  ""I can't help but think, what if I had thought 'this is great' and just taken him, then what?""

Is the epidemic finally coming to an end in India?,"Soutik BiswasIndia correspondent Is the sharp drop in India's coronavirus cases as dramatic and curious as some believe?  Is the epidemic firmly in retreat in a country where many early modellers had predicted millions of deaths due to Covid-19? In October, I had written extensively on why the epidemic appeared to be slowing down in India. Cases had hit a record peak in the middle of September - there were more than a million active cases. After that daily deaths and caseloads began declining despite consistent testing and some short and fierce spikes of infections in cities like Delhi.   The situation has markedly improved since.   By the middle of last week, India was barely counting an average of 10,000 Covid cases every day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease slid to below 100. More than half of India's states were not reporting any Covid deaths. On Tuesday, Delhi, once an infection hotspot, did not record a single Covid death, for the first time in 10 months.  So far, India has recorded more than 10 million infections - the second-highest in the world after the US. There have been over 150,000 reported deaths from the disease. The number of deaths per million people stands at 112, much lower than what has been reported in Europe or North America. It is also clear that the decline in cases is not because of lower testing. Most pandemics typically rise and fall in a bell-shaped curve. India has been no exception. Also, it has seen a high proportion of cases and deaths of people above the age of 65 living in densely packed cities, hewing to infection trends around the world. ""There's nothing unusual about infections dropping in India. There's no miracle here,"" says Dr Shahid Jameel, a leading virologist. Experts say there's no dearth of possible causes - explained below - for the relatively low severity of the disease and its toll.   ""We still don't have causal explanations. But we do know India as a nation is far from herd immunity,"" says Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan who has been closely tracking the pandemic. Herd immunity happens when a large portion of a community becomes immune to a disease through vaccination or through the mass spread of the disease. The latest sero survey - studies that pick up antibodies - suggests 21% of adults and 25% of children have been already infected with the virus.  It also found that 31% of people living in slums, 26% of non-slum urban populations and 19% living in rural areas have been exposed to the virus. That's far below 50% - a figure reported by some of the bigger cities, such as Pune and Delhi. Here, there is evidence of much higher levels of exposure to the virus, hinting that these places are likely closer to herd immunity.  But experts say the numbers are still too low.  ""There is no region in the country which can be deemed to have attained herd immunity, though small pockets may exist,"" Dr K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a Delhi-based think tank, told me. So people who have still not been exposed to the virus in places with high prevalence of infection may remain protected in their communities but would become vulnerable if they travelled to areas where transmission levels are lower. Experts say there could be a couple of different reasons. For one, India has seen a ""patchwork"" pandemic with cases waxing and waning at different times in different parts of the country.  More people have been infected in cities - especially in packed slums - and in developed, urbanised districts than in smaller towns or villages. In all of these places, their exposure to the virus has varied significantly. Cases have now slowed down in most urban areas, but rural India still remains a bit of a mystery. ""My hunch is exposure to the infection is much higher than what the surveys indicate. Also we should not be taking India as one. In some cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, and Bangalore, up to 60% of people have been found with antibodies to the virus. So it's all very uneven,"" says Dr Shahid Jameel, a leading virologist.  The other explanation is that India has and continues to miss lots of cases, mainly because a large number of infected people have no symptoms at all or have a very mild infection.  ""If we have had a massive number of very mild or asymptomatic cases, we might have reached a threshold of herd immunity already. If that is the case we still have to explain, why so many Indian cases have been so mild?"" asks Partha Mukhopadhyay, a senior fellow at Delhi's Centre for Policy Research, who has been studying the pandemic. Most scientists believe that many more Indians died of the infection than what the official figures reveal. India has a poor record of certifying deaths and a large number of people die at home.  But even such a scale of under-reporting has not caused public panic or overwhelmed hospitals. Consider this. India has some 600,000 villages. Even one undiagnosed and unreported death from Covid in each village every day would not overwhelm the public health system. India imposed a sweeping, early shutdown in late March to halt the spread of the virus. Scientists believe that the shutdown, which stretched to nearly 70 days, did prevent a lot of infections and deaths.  Transmission slowed in the badly-hit cities because of the expanded use of face masks, physical distancing, school and office closures and people working from home. Scientists have also attributed lower fatalities to a young population, protective immunity, a vast rural populace with negligible links with cities, genetics, poor hygiene, and ample lung protecting protein. A number of studies have said the infection is largely spread by the virus floating indoors, tiny droplets hanging in stagnant air in poorly ventilated rooms.   But more than 65% of Indians live and work in the countryside. Brazil, for example, is nearly three-times more urbanised than India, and that could partly explain the high number of cases and fatalities there, say scientists. In cities, the overwhelming majority of India's workforce is engaged in the informal economy. This means many of them, such as construction workers or street vendors, do not work in closed spaces.  ""The transmission risks are lower for persons working in open or semi-closed ventilated spaces,"" Dr Reddy says. It's too early to say.  Some experts fear that India could see a spurt in infections with the onset of the monsoons, which also marks the beginning of the country's influenza season. It lasts from June to September and wreaks flood havoc across South Asia every year. ""The beginning of the upcoming monsoon season is going to be critical. We can only make an informed assessment on whether the pandemic has truly run its course in India after the season is over, "" says an epidemiologist who preferred to be unnamed.  The real elephants in the room, say scientists, are the new variants of the virus identified in South Africa, Brazil and the UK.  Since a large number of Indians have still not been exposed to Covid-19, a dominant strain could easily travel to relatively uninfected areas and trigger fresh outbreaks.   India had reported more than 160 cases of the UK variant until the end of January. It's not clear whether the other variants are already circulating in the country. India could also easily have home-grown variants.  The UK variant was detected in Kent in September, but became the reason for a full-blown second wave only two months later. Since then it has been found in more than 50 countries, and is now set to become the world's dominant strain. India has enough scientific labs, but genome sequencing is still spotty, scientists say.  ""The variant story is the big one. It could upset all our calculations. We need to be very vigilant, and our labs should scale up genome sequencing to look out for variants,"" Dr Jameel says.  Clearly, India needs to speed up its vaccination drive - some six million jabs have been given in just under a month. The government aims to inoculate 300 million people by August to make sure a second wave does not result in widespread infections.  And there's no room for complacency yet - doctors and scientists urge people to avoid mass gatherings and crowded areas, and continue to use face mask and practise hand hygiene.

Solving Covid easy compared with climate - Gates,"By Justin RowlattChief environment correspondent Fifty-one billion and zero - the two numbers Bill Gates says you need to know about climate. Solving climate change would be ""the most amazing thing humanity has ever done"", says the billionaire founder of Microsoft. By comparison, ending the pandemic is ""very, very easy"", he claims. Mr Gates's new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster, is a guide to tackling global warming. Don't underestimate the scale of the challenge, he told me when we spoke last week.  ""We've never made a transition like we're talking about doing in the next 30 years. There is no precedent for this."" Fifty-one billion is how many tonnes of greenhouse gases the world typically adds to the atmosphere each year. Net zero is where we need to get to.  This means cutting emissions to a level where any remaining greenhouse gas releases are balanced out by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. One way to do this is by planting trees, which soak up CO2 through their leaves. Mr Gates' focus is on how technology can help us make that journey. Renewable sources like wind and solar can help us decarbonise electricity but, as Mr Gates points out, that's less than 30% of total emissions. We are also going to have to decarbonise the other 70% of the world economy - steel, cement, transport systems, fertiliser production and much, much more. We simply don't have ways of doing that at the moment for many of these sectors. The answer, says Mr Gates, will be an innovation effort on a scale the world has never seen before. This has to start with governments, he argues. At the moment, the economic system doesn't price in the real cost of using fossil fuels.  Most users don't pay anything for the damage to the environment done by pollution from the petrol in their car or the coal or gas that created the electricity in their home.  ""Right now, you don't see the pain you're causing as you emit carbon dioxide,"" is how Mr Gates puts it. That's why he says governments have to intervene.  ""We need to have price signals to tell the private sector that we want green products,"" he says.  That is going to require a huge investment by governments in research and development, Mr Gates argues, as well as support to allow the market for new products and technologies to grow, thereby helping drive down prices. Yet Mr Gates was famous for arguing that regulation stifled innovation when he was building Microsoft into the multi-billion-dollar behemoth it is now.  So isn't it a bit rich for him now to demand government intervention?   He replies he has always supported ""the basic role of government in terms of roads and justice and education and scientific research"". And, on the climate issue, he maintains it will be impossible to avoid a disaster, particularly for those who live near the equator, without governments around the world getting behind the effort. The Republican Party in America needs to recognise the importance of tackling climate change, says Mr Gates. This needs to be a ""constant 30-year push"", he maintains. ""Business just can't change all that physical infrastructure unless the market signals are constant and very clear."" Simply consuming less stuff - fewer flights, local food, less electricity and gas - won't solve the problem.   ""India is going to build housing for their people, provide lighting at night, air conditioning to make conditions liveable,"" Mr Gates believes, so global demand will not reduce. He argues political action is more important, demanding government do the right thing, and, using our voices as consumers, insisting the same of companies. ""If you buy an electric car, a hamburger made of a meat substitute, an electric heat pump for your home you are helping increase the production of these products and therefore helping drive prices down."" Mr Gates still enjoys the trappings of the billionaire lifestyle.    He uses private jets, but insists that they are powered by biofuels - aviation fuels made from plant products. ""I pay three times as much now for my aviation fuel, you know, over $7m [Â£5m] a year in all my offset spending.""  And he has joined a Â£3bn bidding war to buy one of the world's largest private jet services companies, a business called Signature Aviation. Is that appropriate when you've just written a book telling the world how to avoid a climate disaster? ""I don't think getting rid of flying would make sense,"" he replies. ""That type of brute force technique won't get us there."" He says the answer has to be ""a type of aviation fuel that doesn't cost much extra and is zero emission and that's got to be biofuels or electric fuels or perhaps using green hydrogen to power the plane"". Mr Gates has become something of a bogeyman for coronavirus conspiracy theorists. He has been accused of everything from concocting the virus in a secret laboratory as part of a project by global elites to depopulate the world, to using vaccinations to implant microchips in people to track and control them. He laughs when asked about this. ""Why would I want to track people? You know, I'm just not that interested in where people are going."" The main focus for his huge charitable efforts to date has been tackling health issues in developing countries.  He tells me he is used to people getting bored when he talks about tuberculosis and malaria at cocktail parties, so this is a real change from what he calls ""the normal obscurity of working on infectious disease"". But he says he was worried that speaking out on climate might attract similar controversy.   ""I don't want to dilute my voice on issues like polio eradication or malaria,"" Mr Gates explains, but says he felt this was the right time to publish his plan for tackling climate change.   He says he wants his ideas to feed into the green stimulus packages being proposed around the world and to be discussed in the run-up to the crucial climate conference the UK is hosting in Glasgow in November this year.  We are at a crucial point in the climate debate, Mr Gates believes. He describes the young generation as having a ""moral conviction"" that they have to be involved in bringing change on the issue.   ""Now we have to take that energy and make sure it's directed at the policies that will make a difference,"" he argues. But it isn't going to be easy, he warns.  This has to continue to be a huge priority for the world year in, year out. The hope is ""we get a bit lucky"" and succeed in developing innovative new technologies that really do solve the hard areas, he says. But he is optimistic that we can still avoid the worst effects of climate change.   ""You know, I've seen many times, innovation surprises us in a positive way."" Follow Justin on Twitter. I've travelled all over the world for the BBC and seen evidence of environmental damage and climate change everywhere. It's the biggest challenge humanity has ever faced.

Computer says go: Taking orders from an AI boss,"By Jonty BloomBusiness reporter Will your future boss be a computer? If your first thought upon reading that sentence was ""well it would be an improvement on my current human one,"" you wouldn't be alone. After all, an artificial intelligence (AI) software system might be better able to organise the staff rota without messing up your holidays. And getting some unbiased feedback from a line manager who can't be accused of having it in for you or of favouring other staff  could make a pleasant change. However, for those of us who have seen the Terminator movies rather too often, the thought of a computer, or robot, bossing you around is also bound to raise fears that the machines are in danger of taking over. Yet this ignores the fact that we already spend a lot of time obeying machines, and we don't even think about it, let alone worry. Jeff Schwartz, a senior partner at business consulting and audit firm Deloitte, and a global adviser on the future of work, points to a simple everyday machine that we all obey unthinkingly. ""A traffic light used to be a job, there used to be a person who would stand there directing the cars,"" he says. ""But very clearly that is now a machine, and it is getting smarter - they are now putting AI into traffic lights [so they can best respond to traffic levels]."" So it seems we are perfectly willing to take orders from a machine in some clearly defined situations.  What has increasingly happened in recent years, however, is that more of us are already being ordered around by computers at work. And experts say that this is only set to increase. Take taxi firm Uber. There isn't a man or woman in the office giving out the jobs to the drivers. It is done automatically by the company's AI software system. Prof Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a business psychologist at University College London, says that while Uber does this to make its service as efficient as possible, there are wider benefits. ""Uber the app isn't biased in favour of someone [a customer or a driver] because they are good looking, or went to the right school, or they have the right accent, or they dress well,"" he says. ""It is all about performance. You can see how technology could make the world of work more meritocratic by focusing more on substance and less on style. ""Companies that can do that will outperform their rivals and be better places to work."" So having a computer boss you about is nothing to be worried about? Shivvy Jervis, founder of business consultancy FutureScape 248, and a forecaster of future working trends, is far from convinced. ""The big caveat here is we need ethical oversight of this,"" she says. ""If you have AI being the boss, a piece of software with decision-making ability, that for me is extremely worrying, and I think it could lead to quite a dystopian future. ""A system that doesn't have adequate ethical oversight, an actual human using their sense of judgement to be able to oversee what the system is deeming to be the supposed right conclusion, is extremely damaging, and that is the true threat."" In the retail sector, Amazon increasingly uses AI systems to direct and monitor staff in its warehouses. This has led to several reports of employees being overworked, accusations that Amazon has repeatedly denied. Amazon says that if the AI notices a worker underperforming, he or she gets additional support and training, which comes from a human. AI software that both gives work to, and checks on, call centre staff has also been criticised for being too demanding, and unfair. However, one provider, CallMiner, tells the BBC that because its call centre monitoring system can ""analyse 100% of interactions"", human supervisors can use that information ""to be better managers"". And staff can be guided ""to perform better over time, and deliver more effective outcomes for customers"".  As AI is increasingly used to monitor staff, a big problem could be whether it gets the final say on which of a firm's workers get let go in a downturn, says Ms Jervis. ""A human might actually favour the person who is a single parent with two children depending on his or her monthly income,"" she says. ""Or think this other person is well-connected, and will land on their feet. ""Software, even if it is asked these questions, cannot hope to understand the answers in that way."" New Tech Economy is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. Prof Sandra Wachter, a senior research fellow in AI at Oxford University, says that when many people think of having a computer as a boss ""they wrongly picture a robot standing over them"". ""Instead, it is all about certain leadership tasks relating to you already being carried out by computer algorithms,"" she says. ""So, for example, there could be software systems running in the background monitoring your performance - the number of calls you carry out, tracking your language on calls, the emails you send, the websites you visit, how often you take breaks. ""These can then be used to determine what salary you get or if you get promoted. My main worry is if these algorithms are being used to predict things that it is impossible for them to do so. For example, what a good worker looks like, and who merits promotion, is very subjective."" In the future this could be an area for governments to legislate on, but it is a bit of a minefield given the blurring between AI and human boss decision making. Prof Chamorro-Premuzic says that despite the concerns about AI bosses, it is important to remember that many humans are dreadful line managers. ""It is very hard for a machine to outperform the best of bosses... but it is not very hard for AI to be a good alternative to a really bad boss."" Prof Wachter adds that human bosses ""should certainly not be seen as the gold standard"". Mr Schwartz says his hope is that AI bosses may help their human counterparts to improve their performance. He says this is because the computer ones will do more of the boring stuff - compile the rotas, set the simple tasks, carry out the initial performance monitoring etc. This will enable the sentient homo sapiens bosses to concentrate on being better team leaders.

Rise in sales of home-cooked food worries watchdog,"By Dougal ShawBusiness reporter, BBC News There has been a ""concerning"" rise in food businesses operating out of people's homes during lockdown, according to the food safety watchdog. Many of them are selling food through social media, putting further pressure on a hygiene inspection system that is under strain because of the crisis. And other experts are also worried.  ""Little food businesses are popping up like mushrooms in lockdown,"" said Julie Barratt from the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health (CIEH). ""There are rank outsiders operating off the radar, who think, 'Oh, my mum can cook', and confuse cooking with catering,"" she added. They sell to locals on apps such as Whatsapp, Instagram and Nextdoor. Many are failing to register as food businesses, meaning their hygiene arrangements are not checked by local authorities. But even those that do register are often not getting an inspection - despite new businesses usually being a priority - because the system is struggling to keep up during the pandemic. Hygiene inspections ceased completely during the first lockdown and since then a scaled-back operation has focused on high-risk cases.  Local authorities are using video calls in a bid to clear the backlog. They allow basic issues to be resolved and reduce the time environmental health officers need to spend on-site. They could be used, for example, to ensure there is a separate sink for washing hands. But these video calls can never be as effective as in-person, surprise inspections, says Ms Barratt. They are unable to reveal things such as ingredients past their use-by date, or rat droppings under the cooker. Indeed, a challenge posed by the new legion of at-home businesses is that even if a physical inspection is required, a 24-hour warning has to be given because it is a private address, so the surprise element is lost. About 44% of new food businesses started since the first lockdown are home-based, according to a new centralised online registration system used by nearly 200 local authorities, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has revealed.  The full picture will be clearer when all local authorities report their registration figures in the new financial year in April. ""The growth of at-home food businesses is a concern,"" the FSA said. ""Local authority resources are already stretched and many are finding it difficult to keep on top of the workload [these at-home food businesses] are generating,"" says Michael Jackson, the FSA's head of regulatory compliance.  Some people are starting food businesses from their home because they have lost work and need to generate income - including professional chefs who have been hit by the closure of restaurants.  Others are on furlough and have time to set up ""side hustles"". Takeaway eating and the idea of cooking for neighbours in need has also become more common in lockdown.  As well as social media platforms, websites such as Olio and Cook My Grub also now allow this new army of at-home food entrepreneurs to find customers, selling everything from cakes to Sunday roasts.  Every new food business must register before it starts selling food. Once registered with the local authority, an environmental health officer can visit in person and this eventually leads to an official food hygiene rating of 0-5 (or pass-fail in Scotland). The business can still trade prior to gaining its rating.  However, the rating is a vital tool for customers to gauge the safety of an establishment and can be a selling point. Indeed, many new at-home food businesses that are well-run and take hygiene seriously are frustrated that they haven't been able to secure a rating yet, due to the backlog. The FSA described the situation with inspections as ""at the edge of our risk appetite"" back in early December, before the current lockdown was announced. There have been no reported outbreaks of food poisoning connected to new at-home businesses so far. However, the FSA wants the public to be aware of the risks. ""Our advice to people when ordering food online is to check that the business has a food hygiene rating and choose only those with a rating of 3 or above, this can be checked on our website,"" says Mr Jackson of the FSA.  ""If a consumer has any doubts about a food seller or a food product, they should report them to the local authority,"" he adds. ""Where sellers do not follow the rules, they may be fined, imprisoned for up to two years, or both."" However, others think the system itself needs an overhaul to protect the public. The law should be changed so that food businesses of any type cannot trade until they have been inspected and rated, says the CIEH's Ms Barratt.

Social businesses shut out of government support,"By Ben KingBusiness reporter, BBC News Hundreds of community-run businesses have been forced to close because they could not access government support, lobby group Social Enterprise UK says. It said the structure of businesses run for a social good and their choice of bank meant they missed out on help. It is calling for easier access to support schemes in the future. There are an estimated 100,000 social enterprises in the UK, employing over 2 million people. Many help those who have been hit hard by the pandemic. The Restore Trust in Bristol is one of those organisations. It provides assistance and training for vulnerable people, including ex-offenders, people with learning disabilities, or long-term unemployed. Like other social enterprises, it is run like a business but for social good rather than maximum profit. Though demand has risen as more newly-unemployed people seek help, the coronavirus crisis has meant that much of the group's income has been delayed, creating a cash-flow problem. The Bounce Bank Loan (BBL) scheme was designed for exactly this situation - to help viable businesses cope with a temporary drop in income caused by the pandemic. But the Restore Trust was not able to take out one of the loans because its bank, Triodos, is not accredited with the scheme. Bounce back loans offer up to Â£50,000 with nothing to pay for the first year, and 2.5% interest thereafter - a cheap source of funding which has been a lifeline for many small businesses. The Restore Trust tried every lender on the government's list, says chief executive Suzanne Thompson, but none of them would let her open a new account and get a bounce-back loan. ""It did feel like the criteria the bank were using to apply them were flawed,"" she says. ""Some businesses that were slightly risky were able to put in an application and the money was in their account the next day."" After trying unsuccessfully since May to get a bounce back loan, the Trust has taken out a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan (CBIL) - another government scheme - from Triodos, which comes with a higher interest rate. Triodos says it didn't join the bounce back loan scheme because the sums involved are too small, and the technical processes are too complex. Most of the loans it offers exceed Â£100,000. ""Triodos have been very supportive,"" says Ms Thompson. ""It was the mainstream banks who were not helpful and put a lot of barriers in the way of accessing government support."" One of the major difficulties social enterprises face is they tend to use so-called ethical banks - like Triodos - which share their values. But many of those banks are not accredited to offer the government's Covid support loans. Switching banks to get access to the loan scheme has worked for some. But it has proved difficult or impossible for others. Few banks are taking new applicants and those that are find themselves deluged with interest. Co-operative and Community Finance, another Bristol-based organisation, provides loans to co-ops and other social enterprises.  The crisis has forced two-thirds of Co-operative and Community Finance's borrowers to slow loan repayments. And that has taken its toll on the lender's own income. It tried to open a new account with HSBC to access a bounce back loan in May, as its existing bank, Unity Trust, did not provide them. Operations manager Alain Demontoux reckons he spent 50 hours applying for a loan from HSBC. But in November, the bank rejected his application without providing a reason. HSBC said it had extremely high demand for new accounts to access bounce back loans, adding that the application was declined after a ""thorough review"". Mr Demontoux has complained to the financial ombudsman, but he was told it is dealing with a four-month backlog. There are other sources of financial support for Social Enterprises, such as the Â£29m Resilience and Recovery Loan Fund and the Â£19m Social Enterprise Support Fund - but these are relatively small compared to the overall size of the sector, and some have now closed. Social Enterprise UK estimates that around one in fifty social enterprises have closed during the pandemic, meaning hundreds of organisations could have been saved with easier access to government help. Last month, the lobby group and other social enterprise and co-operative organisations wrote to the Treasury asking for easier access to government-backed loan schemes. ""The government just ignored the [ethical lenders] and assumed that mainstream lenders would pick up the slack, which they haven't,"" said Andrew O'Brien, director of external affairs. ""A lot of social enterprises are desperate to get back to helping people and they are not going to be able to do that if they can't get access to the financing they need."" The British Business Bank, which administers CBIL and bounce back loan schemes, said any eligible lender could apply to offer them, and ""lending decisions under the schemes are fully delegated to the accredited lenders.""

We showed volunteers an anti-vax video. How did they react?,"By Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation reporter, BBC News Activists have been targeting people with fears about vaccines in a social media blitz. In an experiment, BBC Panorama showed a panel one video filled with falsehoods to see how it affected their willingness to get a jab. In a sleepy suburb of Norwich, 83-year-old Rosemary opens a WhatsApp message from a relative.  It contains a video called Ask the Experts. The clip features people with impressive medical and scientific titles based in the UK, US, Spain and Sweden.  Some allege, contrary to the evidence, that Covid-19 vaccines are unsafe, that they can alter a person's DNA - and even that the pandemic is somehow not real. Rosemary is frightened - and suddenly unsure about whether she'll get vaccinated. ""It sounded so real and the people were so plausible and they were named as clinicians and doctors,"" she says. With the majority of the elderly and at-risk groups having had their jabs, the next big challenge for the government is to vaccinate everyone else in the UK.  Most people say they want a jab, but the latest anti-vaccine tactics deployed by a committed minority seek to exploit people's nervousness. Rosemary is just one of millions exposed to tactics used by anti-vaccine activists - a loose collection of people who make a variety of claims about vaccines, including suggesting they are dangerous and a form of state control. Over the course of 27 minutes, the Ask the Experts video relentlessly introduces 33 people, many brandishing their credentials, often sitting in what look like medical consultation rooms.  They confidently and calmly repeat similar messages - although many of the claims are misleading or just plain untrue.   Rosemary was left shocked as these people - who looked similar to the doctors she would usually turn to for sound advice -  said that Covid-19 was ""not a real medical pandemic"", that vaccines alter your DNA, that they cause infertility and that they're part of a deliberate global plan to hurt people. She's not alone in being scared by the video. One London council has issued a warning after the Ask The Experts video started circulating in Asian and black communities. These groups have been disproportionately affected by coronavirus - and there are indications that some ethnic minority groups have a higher level of reluctance when it comes to Covid-19 vaccines. ""The fact that they are targeting it at those communities will mean that there will be people who die as a result of not having the vaccine,"" says Westminster council leader Rachael Robathan. Despite being removed from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, it's been claimed that Ask the Experts has been seen more than 250,000 times.  It's gone viral on WhatsApp and its producers have been asking for donations via PayPal. The video is just one part of an online anti-vaccine blitz. Exclusive research by BBC Monitoring has found a huge increase in followers of social media accounts promoting anti-vaccine material during the pandemic. These aren't accounts asking legitimate medical questions - but people and organisations who've already made up their minds against vaccinations, and are manufacturing evidence or twisting facts to support their conclusions. On Instagram, the number of followers of major anti-vaccination accounts increased nearly five-fold in 2020, to more than four million. On Facebook, the top anti-vaccination pages grew by 19% in the last year and followers of Twitter accounts sharing anti-vaccine claims almost trebled. The increases came alongside a huge overall surge in people seeking out health information online due to the pandemic. But the raw numbers still mean false anti-vaccine claims are reaching millions more than ever before. How do the misinformation and conspiracy theories pushed by the video affect the views of people who have legitimate questions about vaccines? I ran a test for BBC Panorama. Our team assembled a panel of eight people from across the country who were unsure about having a Covid-19 vaccine. Logging on to a Zoom call on a January evening, they view the Ask the Experts video as we observe their reactions. Our experiment happens under the watchful eye of Dr Liam Smeeth, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who's also a GP. Rob - a 27-year-old volunteer radio DJ in Norfolk who's spending the latest lockdown trying to raise people's spirits with music - questions the speed of vaccine trials. It's a concern shared by 20-year-old law student Phoebe, who has other worries. ""Every time I search about the Covid vaccine and fertility, it literally changes, so often it's quite overwhelming,"" she says.  Experts say that the coronavirus vaccines have gone through the same rigorous process as other vaccines - and there's no biological mechanism by which it could affect fertility.  After expressing their concerns, the panel begins watching Ask the Experts. I didn't tell them what the video was about - and reactions vary. Eddie, a 76-year-old from Northumberland, furrows his brow in front of a backdrop of watercolours he's painted during lockdown. ""I thought at first 'Are these actors? Is this just a sham?'"" he says. ""And as I went on, I realised that they were real."" Another person in the video appears wearing a white lab coat, pictured in what looks like a hospital. Matt - a 31-year-old who works in IT - nods along, listening attentively. ""I feel I could trust some of them,"" he says, eyes glued to the screen. But the footage turns off others. As one of the people in the video argues, with an air of authority, that this is ""not a real medical pandemic"", Russell from Norwich puts his head in his hands. He was ill with coronavirus last year. ""Blimey! It's like being hit over the head a number of times. For half-an-hour,"" he says. ""I feel like I'm being brainwashed."" Phoebe, the law student, also senses she's being fed misinformation. She crumples her face in disgust. ""If these people are saying the virus isn't real, I'm less inclined to believe what they say about the vaccine being dangerous,"" she says. However, after watching the video half of the group says they are more worried about having a Covid-19 vaccine than before. ""It's being rushed, and there hasn't been too much information,"" says decorator Steven from Inverness, who has had cancer. ""I do agree with all that part of it."" Shaun, who's a chef, was also swayed.  ""The video says what I've had in the back of my mind,"" he says, running his hand through his hair as he tries to make sense of what he has just watched.  Dr Smeeth's main fear, that the video would amplify people's pre-existing fears, has materialised.  He wants any doctor or professional promoting false claims to face disciplinary action. ""I would certainly be very pro them being investigated and any evidence of harm being looked at,"" he says, ""and them being stopped from using their title.""  We have one more question - in the face of bad health information, can accurate advice from a respected expert increase trust in science? One by one, Dr Smeeth tackles the concerns raised by the panel. The vaccine doesn't change your DNA, he explains. It has been through animal trials, and there's no biological mechanism by which it would affect your fertility, he adds. After the discussion, all our volunteers say they're leaning towards having the vaccine. And some are even enthusiastic. ""I will definitely have it now,"" says Eddie, the painter from Northumberland, chuckling as he logs off. Back in Norwich, once Rosemary also realised that many of the claims made in the video were false, she made her decision. ""I'm so relieved to be getting the vaccine,"" she told me as her husband Donald prepared to visit their local GP. Panorama contacted all 33 people in the video. Eleven responded - four defended the video's contents, five said if we referred to them as anti-vaccine they'd take legal action, and one made no comment. Another acknowledged the virus is real and causes diseases and deaths, but said the measures to manage the pandemic are disproportionate. Panorama invited Oracle Films, which produced the video, to comment. The filmmakers chose not to.  After Panorama contacted PayPal about the request for donations, its account was taken down. Facebook - which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram - removed a number of the pages and posts flagged by Panorama. The company says it continues to step up its enforcement policies about harmful misinformation and actively points people towards credible information. Twitter gave us a similar statement and said it's prioritising the removal of Covid-19 content that could potentially cause harm.  But the Ask the Experts video is still in circulation on WhatsApp - one of thousands of videos and posts by anti-vaccine activists, who are still fighting to scare people away with false claims.

'Overjoyed' Harry and Meghan expecting second child,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting their second child, a spokesperson for the couple has said. Harry and Meghan are preparing to welcome a brother or sister for their son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned one last May. A spokesperson for the couple said they were ""overjoyed"". A Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Prince of Wales and the rest of the Royal Family ""are delighted and wish them well"". Harry and Meghan shared a black and white picture of themselves under a tree, with Harry resting his hand on Meghan's head as she cradles her bump. Their child will be eighth in line to the throne.  Meghan's due date has not been revealed, but her bump appeared prominent in the photograph. The news comes after the duchess said in November that she had suffered a miscarriage last July, writing in an article of feeling ""an almost unbearable grief"". A spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said: ""We can confirm that Archie is going to be a big brother.  ""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to be expecting their second child."" Misan Harriman, a friend of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and the photographer who took the photo that accompanied their pregnancy announcement, tweeted: ""Meg, I was there at your wedding to witness this love story begin, and my friend, I am honoured to capture it grow.  ""Congratulations to The Duke and Duchess of Sussex on this joyous news!"" The Valentine's Day announcement comes just five days after the royal family celebrated the arrival of Princess Eugenie's first child - a baby boy. Harry and Meghan's second child will be the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh's 10th or 11th great-grandchild depending on whether he or she arrives before or after Zara Tindall's baby, which is also due in 2021. They will follow the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, Prince Louis, Harry, and Archie Mountbatten-Windsor in the line of succession. But they will not be entitled, at this stage, to be an HRH nor a prince or a princess due to rules set out more than 100 years ago by George V. The baby is entitled to be a Lord or a Lady. Harry and Meghan met on a blind date, arranged by a mutual friend, and got engaged 16 months later.  The duchess had first found fame as an actress, playing Rachel Zane in US legal drama Suits, but gave up her career when she got married. The Sussexes married in May 2018 in a ceremony at Windsor Castle and then a year later welcomed their first child, Archie, who was born on 6 May 2019. Meghan and Harry quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California.  This week, Meghan won a privacy case against Associated Newspapers (ANL), saying the damage the publisher had done ""runs deep"". She had brought a claim against ANL, publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over the publication of extracts from a letter to her father.

Fake tradesmen Covid-breach pub 'set to reopen',"A pub that was shut down for Covid-19 rule-breaches, including customers disguised as tradesmen, looks set to reopen under new management. Y-Bodunig had its licence revoked after managers of the Dyserth pub tried to ""hoodwink"" police officers. In one act a man stood on a ladder as the ex-boss spoke to an officer and then continued drinking as the officer left, Denbighshire council heard. Peter Winney and Mark Atkinson have now submitted an application for a licence. Referring to events after lockdown began last year, North Wales Police solicitor Gareth Preston told the council's licensing committee then manager Derek Coulton put people at risk of virus transmission.  During a ""string of incidents"", CCTV footage showed people entering the pub via a back door before hiding from a police community support officer. In another incident, Mr Coulton's son was seen carrying a circular saw into the premises and sprinkling sawdust on the bar to make it appear that work was going on. Mr Preston described Mr Coulton as having been ""dishonest, obstructive and indeed devious in his attempts to continue licensed activity during the lockdown"". A council spokesman said: ""The applicants are aware of the reasons for the former licence being revoked and have consulted with North Wales Police and taken advice regarding their operating schedule."" It is understood that the applicants for the new licence have outlined their intention to train staff on the Challenge 25 policy, to provide effective CCTV and to have a zero tolerance regarding drugs on the premises.

Australia halts travel bubble after NZ lockdown,"Australia has suspended its quarantine-free travel arrangement with New Zealand after the discovery of three new coronavirus cases in Auckland. New Zealand's biggest city was put into a three-day lockdown over the cases. Australia's department of health said all people flying into Australia during this three-day period would be required to spend a fortnight in hotel quarantine.  Both countries have been praised for their handling of the pandemic. Australia has recorded 909 deaths since it began, while New Zealand has reported 25. Australia's health department said the suspension of the travel arrangement followed an ""urgent meeting"" between Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly and top health officials in the states that had been open to ""green zone"" flights. It added that states would determine ""how to manage people who have already arrived in Australia from New Zealand and who may pose a risk of transmitting"" the virus. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Sunday ordered Auckland to go into lockdown after the discovery of three new local cases of Covid-19. Under the measures, the city's 1.7 million residents are required to stay at home except for essential shopping and work. Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted. Ms Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission. She said the country was going ""hard and early"" after the cases were identified. The rest of the country is moving to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible. The three community cases were identified in a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland. It is unclear how the three contracted Covid-19.

'Big ask' for secondary schools to open on 8 March,"It would be a ""big ask"" to reopen secondary schools in Northern Ireland on 8 March, a British Medical Association (BMA) leader has said. But Dr Tom Black, the BMA's Northern Ireland chairman, said he was hopeful primary schools could reopen then. The Stormont executive has agreed that schools in Northern Ireland will remain closed until 8 March at the earliest. Last week a teaching union said a full return to school ""may not be possible for some time"". Speaking on BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme, Dr Black said the reopening of primary schools was more likely because ""we know the transmission infection in younger children is much lower"". He said: ""The chief medical officer and the Department of Health will look carefully at data and look at the R number - which is 0.8 at the moment. ""Opening schools has an increase of between 0.3 and 0.6 in the R number, so we couldn't do that at the moment. ""Maybe in March, primary schools to open and see what effect it has. ""We really want the schools open before anything else, but secondary schools might be a reach at the moment."" On Sunday, the Department of Health said 11 more people had died with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland and another 176 had tested positive for the virus. Some 476 patients in Northern Ireland's hospitals have the virus - 58 of them are in intensive care units (ICU). So far 391,101 people in Northern Ireland have had their first dose of the vaccine and 28,976 have had their second. In the Republic of Ireland, 17 Covid-19-related deaths were confirmed on Sunday and another 788 people have tested positive. There are 899 inpatients with coronavirus, 160 of whom are in ICU.  As of Thursday - the most recent figures available - 171,239 people in the Republic of Ireland had received their first dose of the vaccine and 89,834 people had received their second. Stormont ministers will meet on Thursday to discuss whether to extend Northern Ireland's lockdown beyond 5 March or begin the process of lifting restrictions from then. Dr Black added that everybody was ""fatigued"" and ""fed up"" with lockdown but that restrictions must be eased gradually to avoid a further spike in cases. He said: ""The last thing we need is a fourth wave, the last thing we need is to ease the lockdowns and bring them back. ""This hopefully will be our last lockdown so let's do it properly. ""It's small steps, it's increments - let's see what we can get away with, let's see what affects the R number, let's see what affects the transmission of infections. ""We are in a good place with vaccines but we are still in a bad place in terms of the number of infections and the number of patients in hospital.""

Heathrow: Quarantine rules may cause flight delays,"People travelling to England from 33 high-risk countries may face suspended flights and long queues at the border, Heathrow Airport has said. The airport said ""good progress"" had been made on a ""number of issues"" with the government's hotel quarantine plan, which comes into force on Monday. But it said it was concerned about whether UK Border Force could ""cope"". The government said it was working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arose. From Monday, British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from a ""red list"" country will have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels for 10 days to try to stop new coronavirus variants entering the country. They will have to pay Â£1,750 for their stay, which covers the cost of the hotel, transport and testing, and book it in advance using a government portal. Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. The ""red list"" mainly consists of countries in South America and Africa, as well as Portugal. Heathrow Airport said it had been ""working hard"" with the government to make sure the plan works. However, in a statement it said ""queues at the border in recent days of almost five hours are totally unacceptable"".  ""Ministers need to ensure there is adequate resource and effective processes at the border to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport, which could necessitate the suspension of some arriving flights,"" it added. The airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers.  The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Regulations for the hotel quarantine measures, which come into force from 04:00 GMT on Monday, have been published. But on Friday the Immigration Services Union said its officials had yet to receive guidance on how the system would work.  The union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. It also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. And the GMB union has warned that ""rushed"" government plans are not thorough enough to make sure workers on the front line in quarantine hotels are protected. The union said security guards were one of the occupations worst hit by Covid deaths, adding that it wanted to meet employers to develop a strategy to better protect workers. Meanwhile, a family returning to the UK after four years living in Abu Dhabi said travellers should not be used as ""guinea pigs"", amid confusion over hotel quarantine rules. Beckie Morris, 30, planned to repatriate to the UK with husband Matthew and their five-week-old daughter, but they now face a quarantine bill of thousands of pounds if they do. The new mother said there was ""no information"" on the government website about what to do with young children. She said: ""We'd have to arrange all the formula. I don't know what we do about sterilising bottles, or nappies or washing their clothes - there's all this unknown. I tried to reach out, and I know it's still really early days, but there's just no information. ""They haven't really laid out what actually happens when you get to that hotel and I don't think that's going to be known until the first person goes in there. ""People shouldn't be used as guinea pigs - especially not paying that amount, that is an extortionate amount of money."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK. ""We are working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arise and ensure the new process runs as smoothly as possible, and we are clear the safety of all staff and passengers is a priority.""

Police pay tribute to officers who died days apart,"The chief constable of Sussex Police has paid tribute to two officers who died two days apart. Jo Shiner said it had been ""a very sad week"" for the service with the ""untimely passing"" of the men. PC Doug Franks, 43, a Bognor officer, died suddenly at his home in Hampshire on Wednesday. Two days later, 50-year-old Sgt Sean Preston, who worked in Worthing and had been admitted to hospital, died after contracting Covid-19. Mr Preston had been working at home for several months before he was taken to hospital in January. Ms Shiner said he was a ""highly respected and experienced officer"" with a ""huge character"" who was ""loved by everyone"" and ""devoted to his family"". Donna Lonsdale, deputy chair of Sussex Police Federation, said: ""We are all devastated by the news of Sean's passing."" He leaves his partner, children and grandchildren.

Hundreds call for free parking at beauty spots,"Hundreds of people have called for plans for parking charges to be brought in at two beauty spots to be scrapped. Stoke-on-Trent City Council has been consulting over proposals and may charge drivers Â£3 for three hours at Westport Lake and Central Forest Park.  But campaigners say the areas are ""vital"" for people's health, particularly during the pandemic.  The council said it had to fill a Â£14m budget gap over four years and would make a decision later this month.  An e-petition backed by more than 2,240 people said Westport Lake had helped people ""improve their mental health"" during lockdowns through exercising and activities such as bird watching and photography.  Annette Cartlidge, of Our Burslem community group which started the petition, feared charges would stop some going and ""seriously impact people's mental health and well being"". She called for the council to ""do the right thing for the people of the city"" and not bring in charges.  ""Westport Lane is a very important public green space that everyone should have free access to in the city, particularly those on low incomes,"" she said.   Around 660 people have petitioned for free parking to remain at Central Forest Park.  The council, which is run by a Conservative and Independent coalition, said like other authorities it had seen a reduction in income because of the pandemic and had to find money for frontline services. Deputy leader Dan Jellyman said: ""We had the option of increasing parking charges in our town centres but felt that would hurt businesses as they start to recover from the pandemic."" He said charging park users was the ""lesser of two evils"" and would generate about Â£60,000 over four years. If approved, charges would start in September.

'Significant milestone' as 15m get Covid jab in UK,"More than 15 million people in the UK have now had their first coronavirus vaccine, in what Boris Johnson described as a ""significant milestone"". The PM hailed the ""extraordinary feat"", reached just over two months after the first jab was given on 8 December. It comes as the government is expected to announce on Monday it has met its pledge to offer a jab to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. The rollout is now being expanded to over-65s and the clinically vulnerable. In a video, Mr Johnson praised a ""truly national, UK-wide effort"", adding that in England the jab had been offered to all those in the top four priority groups.  Wales has also met the target. But ""no-one is resting on their laurels,"" Mr Johnson said. ""We've still got a long way to go to. And there will undoubtedly be bumps in the road. But after all we've achieved, I know we can go forward with great confidence."" Sunday's daily coronavirus figures show 15,062,189 people have now received an initial vaccine dose - after 505,362 first jabs were given out on Saturday.  A further 258 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, taking the death toll by that measure to 117,166. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. There were 10,972 new cases reported, bringing the total number of recorded infections to 4,038,078.  NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the 15 million milestone was a ""remarkable shared achievement"" - reached 10 weeks after the first vaccine was administered in the UK. ""The NHS vaccination programme is the biggest and fastest in Europe - and in the health service's history - and that is down to the skill, care, and downright hard work of our fantastic staff, supported by local communities, volunteers and the armed forces,"" he said.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it meant one in every four adults was now ""starting to receive protection from this dreadful disease"".  But he cautioned: ""There is so much more to do and I urge anyone eligible to step forward and take up their appointment. The vaccine is our route to freedom - we will beat this virus jab by jab."" So far the vaccination programme has been aimed at the top four priority groups, including NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, over-70s, and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. These groups have accounted for 88% of the UK's Covid-19 deaths so far, according to the Department of Health and Social Care and are estimated by the JCVI to be some 15 million people.  A small number of the 15 million to receive a jab will have been outside these priority groups. Ruth Rankine, director of the NHS Confederation's PCN Network of GP practices, paid tribute to the ""incredible accomplishment"" but added that ""until everyone is protected, no one is protected"". ""There is still work to do to administer first doses to all the remaining people from the first four cohorts, as well as moving down the cohorts until everyone has at least been offered a jab, not to mention beginning the work of administering second doses,"" she said.   Labour's shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, said ministers needed to ""lock in the gains of vaccination"" and introduce further measures to reduce the spread of the disease.  This included increased financial support for those who have to self-isolate, updated guidance on masks and help to make workplaces Covid secure.  It is undeniable the vaccine programme has overall been a success - only Israel and the United Arab Emirates have done more jabs per head. But as well as pushing ahead with the under-70s, efforts need to continue to reach out to those not yet vaccinated in these first groups. There have been reports of housebound patients still waiting, while some have questioned whether enough has been done to reach out to those who have concerns and have not taken up the offer. The fear is uptake may be lowest in some of the most vulnerable communities and that risks widening health inequalities. People will also ask what this means for unlocking. Those offered the jab account for around five in six deaths but just over half of hospitalisations. That leaves a lot of vulnerable at risk - and with the numbers in hospital still above the peak in the first wave, the NHS isn't yet out of the woods. From Monday, the vaccination programme enters a new phase, with over-65s and the clinically vulnerable being invited to book a jab.  The JCVI defines clinically vulnerable people as those with conditions including chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. Some regions have already started vaccinating people aged 65 to 69, with NHS England having previously said that people in this age group could get a vaccine if GPs had supplies. Earlier, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab rejected calls from MPs in his party to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". On Saturday, the prime minister said he was ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown, citing ""huge progress"" made with the vaccine rollout. The UK is currently administering doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and the one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. Its vaccination rate is the third highest in the world, behind only Israel and the UAE.

Closing travel quarantine loophole 'is critical',"Scotland's transport secretary has said it is ""absolutely critical"" the UK closes a loophole as new quarantine regulations are set to come into force. From 04:00 on Monday all international arrivals in Scotland must self-isolate in hotels for 10 days.  But in England the rules only apply to arrivals from 33 ""red list"" countries. Michael Matheson has asked for Scotland-bound travellers arriving at English airports to be offered quarantine facilities in England.  The UK government said it had put in place ""some of the toughest border regimes in the world"" to raise defences against new strains. The Scottish Conservatives accused Scottish ministers of ""stoking a row"" to distract attention from the ""mess"" they had made of their own quarantine plans. Labour, meanwhile, said the Scottish government was ""clueless"" about how it would make the new rules work. Edinburgh Airport also criticised the Scottish government for making late changes - and warned that passengers arriving on Monday could be unaware of the new requirements. The different approaches being taken by the UK and Scottish governments have raised concerns that people arriving at English airports and ferry terminals will then travel on to Scotland.  Passengers required to self-isolate in hotels will have to pay the Â£1,750 cost of their managed quarantine, which could encourage people to avoid this by choosing English airports even if Scotland is their final destination. Mr Matheson said his preference was for a UK-wide approach in which all international travellers must quarantine, but failing that he said quarantine facilities should be extended to travellers who plan to ""transit on"" to Scotland.  He told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show: ""What we have said is that for those who are arriving in English airports and travelling on to Scotland, that they should make it available for them to be able to go into a quarantine facility in England before travelling on to Scotland. ""And, as yet, we are still waiting for the UK government to give us agreement on that."" The UK government's health secretary Matt Hancock has previously said passengers arriving in England from ""low risk"" countries would be required to quarantine at home - even if their home was in Scotland - rather than face hotel quarantine at their point of entry. Reacting to Mr Matheson's call for the UK to go further, a government spokesman said: ""As we have said throughout the pandemic, you must follow the rules set by the relevant devolved administration when in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  ""Those arriving into England can transit onto Scotland but must follow the quarantine and self-isolation rules of the devolved administration on arrival."" Mr Matheson also said another option would be for details of Scotland-bound travellers to be passed on so they could asked to quarantine at Scottish hotels.  But he added: ""The problem with that is these are individuals who are then going to be potentially travelling on public transport and the risk of spreading any new variant they may be carrying."" He ruled out police border checks being put in place, saying that would be too much of an operational challenge, given the volume of traffic crossing the border every day.  Edinburgh Airport has, meanwhile, criticised the Scottish government's plans, saying it has spent the last few days trying to make its suggestions ""fit for purpose"". A spokesperson said: ""The initial discussions were lacking in basic detail and knowledge of our operations. This is exactly why we wanted to be engaged far earlier in the process rather than being in a race against time. ""We are hours away from this policy going live and still the government is changing its mind on a key issue around arrivals from Ireland and the need for quarantine, with connecting passengers from amber countries potentially able to avoid managed isolation altogether.  ""This uncertainty does not inspire confidence for airports."" Scottish Conservative transport spokesman Graham Simpson said the SNP were ""stoking a row to distract from the mess they have made of their own hotel quarantine plans"".  He added: ""They urgently need to get a grip of this situation, and make sure these new measures are made to work.  ""There is no guidance, precious little consultation with airports, no details how hotels will be made Covid-secure.  ""The Scottish people want to see their two governments working together at this time, not caught in a blame game."" Scottish Labour spokesman Colin Smyth said: ""It's farcical. We are hours from this policy coming into force and the Scottish government are clueless over how they will make it work. Once again the SNP's actions don't live up to their rhetoric.  ""Instead of competing against each other over who can sound the toughest, it's time for the UK and Scottish governments to work together to put in place a policy that keeps the people of Scotland safe."" Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said that, rather than attacking each other, the two governments should work together on a plan to stop the spread of Covid. Mr Matheson also insisted that officials had been in contact with airlines earlier in the week to make them aware of the new arrangements. The Scottish government has block-booked six hotels for travellers who are forced to quarantine, three close to Edinburgh airport, two in Glasgow and one in Aberdeen. Mr Matheson said ""a number"" of these hotels would be operational from Monday.  Passengers travelling to Scottish airports must fill out a Home Office passenger locator form, take a pre-departure Covid test and show they have made quarantine arrangements prior to arriving in Scotland, he said. These will be checked again by Border Force on arrival in Scotland.  Passengers will then be met by security, taken to baggage reclaim and then on to transport to the quarantine hotel, he said.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56060224,1
UK scientist defends WHO Wuhan fact-finding mission,"A member of the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of Covid-19 has defended the credibility of its work amid mounting criticism. Prof John Watson told the BBC that the trip to Wuhan, China - where the virus was first detected - was only a start and more research would be needed.  The US, UK and members of the team have complained of insufficient access given to the mission by the authorities. China has insisted it was transparent. The international team of experts concluded their trip to the city of Wuhan earlier this week without any definitive answers on what caused the outbreak. Wuhan was the first place in the world where the virus was detected, in late 2019. Since then, more than 108 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing, and was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Prof Watson sought to allay doubts about the mission, saying the trip was ""the beginning of a process... that was going to take months or years to complete"". He said that while Chinese authorities had not given the team all of the data about the early cases in Wuhan, they had seen a ""great deal"" of information. His comments came amid growing criticism over the level of data scientists were able to access. Fellow mission member Dominic Dwyer told several news outlets that Chinese authorities declined to give the team raw data on early Covid-19 cases. ""They showed us a couple of examples, but that's not the same as doing all of them, which is standard epidemiological investigation,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. ""So then, you know, the interpretation of that data becomes more limited from our point of view, although the other side might see it as being quite good."" The US has urged China to make data available from the earliest stages of the outbreak, saying it has ""deep concerns"" about the WHO report. And British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said he shared concerns about the level of access given to the team. In his comments on Sunday, Prof Watson said it would have been ""unusual for them [Chinese authorities] to hand over the raw data, but we looked at a great deal of the information in detail in discussion with the Chinese counterparts"". He also said a number of hypotheses remain about the origins of the virus, the most likely of which is that it moved from one animal to an intermediate animal host, and from there to humans. He added the team had not ""ruled out"" the possibility that the virus was started by a lab leak in Wuhan, or that it could have spread through the transport and trade of frozen food.  The head of the mission earlier this week called the lab leak theory ""extremely unlikely"".

Nine priority groups 'to get first Covid jab by May',"By James WilliamsBBC Wales political correspondent Wales' top nine priority groups will have received a first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of April, the first minister has said. The over-70s, care home residents and staff, health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable have already been offered the jab.  Mark Drakeford is ""confident"" on vaccinating the next five groups ""provided nothing gets in the way"". An updated roadmap out of lockdown will be published on Friday. At the next lockdown review on 19 February, the government will prioritise the return of three-to-seven year olds to school, along with some older children on vocational courses, said Mr Drakeford.  Speaking on the BBC Politics Wales programme, the first minister said other changes would be ""very marginal"", including the possibility of allowing ""the outdoors to be used a little more"" and more flexibility for families. ""But the cabinet will not make those decisions until Thursday when we have the very latest information,"" he added. Mr Drakeford said he hoped on Friday to be able to indicate ""how we will plan"" to get more children back to the classroom, possibly from the following review on 12 March. Ministers have started ""cautious"" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter. The reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation is likely to be prioritised in the first instance. Although he has not ruled it out, Mr Drakeford has suggested it is unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April. From Monday, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving in England from 33 red-list countries will have to quarantine for 10 days in hotels selected by the government. People entering Scotland from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels. From 04:00 GMT on Monday, people arriving in England and Scotland from red-list countries will be fined if they break their 10-day quarantine and enter Wales. Asked whether people arriving at Cardiff Airport once commercial flights restart will have to quarantine regardless of which country they have flown from, Mr Drakeford said: ""It may be that later on in March, if and when flights resume, that we will need to put those things in place. ""We will learn from the next few weeks, see what is necessary, see how the regimes are being put in place in the seven entry ports in Scotland and England, and then make a decision about what's needed here in Wales,"" he added. People aged five and over arriving into Wales from abroad are already required to isolate for 10 days. They will now also be required to undertake a Covid-19 test on the second and eighth day of their 10-day isolation period. Failure to do so will be a criminal offence, liable to a fine, and failure to undertake both tests will also mean that the isolation period is extended to 14 days.

Poverty 'caused high Covid death rates' Coronavirus: Daily briefing",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56061666,1
Poverty 'caused high Covid death rates',"By Teleri Glyn JonesBBC Wales News Poverty and health inequality are behind the high Covid death rates in the south Wales valleys, a public health boss has said. In Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) the rate is 340.3 deaths per 100,000 population - the third highest in the UK.  But, Cwm Taf Morgannwg's director for public health said the rate had been predictable. The Welsh Government said an ""unprecedented series of interventions"" was made to protect people's health. Kelechi Nnoaham, director for public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg, said the issues that led the problem ""we've known about for years"" and this result could have been foreseen. ""It is fundamentally about poverty and health inequalities,"" Dr Nnoaham said. ""If someone had pulled any one of us up in February 2020 and said, 'There's a pandemic coming, can you fast forward one year and assess which communities would have the most severe hit from this pandemic?', you could almost predict the picture we're seeing now with a reasonable degree of accuracy."" Two of the highest death rates in Wales are in the RCT local authority area.  Tonyrefail West has seen 53 deaths, which puts its rate at 515.7 deaths per 100,000 people, and in Penrhiwceiber there have been 26 deaths - a mortality rate of 436.9 per 100,000 population. ""We have known it's poverty and health inequality for several years,"" Dr Nnoaham said.  ""The question is what have we done? To what extent have we been successful in removing those vulnerabilities?"" Previous attempts to tackle poverty and the associated health inequalities have been ""tokenistic"" and have not done enough to remedy the root cause of the problems, he added. ""For many years... we have talked about the fact there's a lot of poverty in the Welsh valleys but we haven't done enough,"" he said. ""We've got to do more, there's such urgency now that we can't keep talking about health inequalities as if they're something academic."" Beyond the figures, communities are mourning.  Rev Peter Lewis, a vicar in Abercynon, says at the height of the pandemic, he was doing around 10 Covid-related funerals a week, but now it is closer to three a week.  The clergy in the area are having training to deal with the trauma and grief they expect to be dealing with in the months and years to come.  School children have been invited to make wooden hearts for Valentine's Day to hang on a memorial tree at St Gwynno's Church in Abercynon.  Rev Lewis said the tree was a ""small contribution to mark that we're a community in loss."" He said though the events have led to the community becoming more resilient. One foodshare scheme, set up by Rhondda MS Leanne Wood, of Plaid Cymru, to redistribute food from supermarkets has seen demand increase over the pandemic. According to its volunteers it is not an exaggeration to say everyone in the Rhondda knows someone who has died of Covid. Janet Slade Jones, one of the volunteers, has been helping out her neighbours since March but she says the last year has been dreadful.  ""I've been to more than 10 funerals this year"", she said.  Fellow foodshare volunteer Trish Denning, a retired teacher, said: ""It's really scary.""  ""A lot of the time I feel in a state of shock when I look at the statistics but you are aware of the population of RCT as an ex-mining valleys. We have a lot of health issues."" Leanne Wood MS said jobs should be the priority to help reduce poverty and health inequality. Ms Wood said: ""The numbers of people who are employed with good jobs in this constituency is way too low.  ""Not enough attention has been paid by UK Government, Welsh Government and the local authority in terms of that all important job creation so that's something that's going to have to change"". A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Coronavirus is the biggest single global public health crisis the world has faced in more than a generation and has had a significant impact on every aspect of our lives.  ""That's why we've mobilised all our resources to respond to the pandemic, launching an unprecedented series of interventions to protect people's health, wellbeing and livelihoods. We will continue to do all we can to support everyone in Wales in the weeks and months ahead."" Politics Wales is on at 10:00 GMT on BBC One, Sunday 14 February.

Raab rejects calls for lockdown easing date,"Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has rejected calls from Conservative MPs to put a date on when England's lockdown measures will be eased, saying the government will be ""cautious"". The lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG) said all restrictions must be lifted by the end of April. Mr Raab told the BBC he was ""confident"" in the vaccine rollout, but added: ""You can't get ahead of the evidence."" So far 14.5 million people have had at least one dose of the vaccine. Mr Raab said that the government was ""on track"" to hit its target of offering the vaccine to 15 million people from the top four priority groups by Monday. The CRG has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say there will be no justification for Covid laws once the top nine priority groups have been vaccinated - which the government is planning to have done by May.  Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We share all of the ambition and the desire to get out of this lockdown. We want to do it responsibly and safely and therefore it's got to be based on the evidence,"" adding, ""You can't get ahead of the evidence of the impact of the vaccine on the transmission."" He said the R-rate was between 0.7 and 1 and, as of Friday, the seven-day totals for admissions, cases and fatalities were down by between a fifth and a quarter respectively. But developments needed to be monitored ""in real time"", making it difficult to give guarantees or be precise about an end of April or beginning of May date for easing, he said.  Mr Johnson said on Saturday he planned a ""cautious"" reopening - the road map for which will be unveiled on 22 February, with restrictions on outdoor recreation expected to be among the first to be relaxed. The CRG - which was formed in November to oppose a third lockdown and says it has the backing of 63 MPs for its letter - said the prime minister should set out a plan for ""a return to normal life"" from 8 March. That is three weeks after Monday's target date for vaccinating 15 million of the most vulnerable - the same length of time the vaccine is believed to need to start taking effect - and the date pencilled in by the government for schools reopening. The top four priority groups, targeted for vaccination by 15 February include: The vaccine rollout has already been officially extended to people outside these groups, with invitations going out in England to people aged 65 to 69 and younger people who are in an at-risk group.  Boris Johnson will spend the next few days looking at data on the spread of coronavirus and the success of the vaccine rollout, before deciding how quickly to reopen society. We know roughly what the order will be: schools, followed by outdoor mixing, non-essential shops then hospitality. Some Conservative MPs - who have been close to the prime minister in recent years - are urging Mr Johnson to move fairly quickly and lift all restrictions by May, when the government plans to have give a first dose to everyone over 50. But Downing Street has been stung in the past after moving too quickly and having to re-impose restrictions in a matter of weeks.  That's why ministers are being cautious at the moment - and why the foreign secretary said it would be wrong to set an arbitrary date.  The CRG called for pubs and restaurants to open by Easter in a ""Covid-secure"" and ""commercially viable"" way, saying two-thirds of the people in the top nine priority groups should have had a first vaccine dose by then. And by the end of the April, when all the priority groups should have had one jab of vaccine, they say all lockdown laws should be removed. The group says the burden of proof should be on ministers to show restrictions are necessary. Scientists and medics have urged caution, saying there is still potential for another surge in cases. Dr Shondipon Laha, a member of the Intensive Care Society, dismissed the idea that Covid-19 could end up being seen on the same level as the flu - something that has been suggested by Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Mr Johnson. ""It's not just deadlier, it's more debilitating. So we're expecting to see significant numbers of patients who have had Covid who need intense rehabilitation."" ""We know that every patient that comes to an intensive care unit that needs ventilation loses muscle mass at 2-3% per day,"" Dr Laha said, adding that many such patients cannot stand and have problems with their long-term memories. Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, said the variations of coronavirus were becoming more infectious and more dangerous, also dismissing suggestions it could be treated the same as flu. She said restrictions should be lifted ""very gently"", and that, in the future, ""short, sharp"" lockdowns should be introduced for a few days to target smaller, localised outbreaks - similar to those being used in Australia.

New Zealand's biggest city ordered into lockdown,"New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ordered the country's biggest city Auckland to go into lockdown after the discovery of three new local cases of Covid-19. The measures will last three days and require residents to stay at home. Ms Ardern said the country was going ""hard and early"" after the cases were identified. New Zealand has won widespread praise for its handling of the pandemic, going months without community transmission.  The country closed its borders entirely to almost all non-citizens or residents early on in the pandemic, aiming to eliminate the virus.  New Zealand, with a population of five million, has recorded just over 2,300 cases of Covid and 25 deaths. The measures in Auckland require its 1.7 million residents to stay at home except for essential shopping and work. Schools and non-essential shops will close, and entry in and out of the city restricted. Ms Ardern said three days should allow the government to get more information and get more testing done, and would also help determine if there was any community transmission. ""New cases of Covid-19 in the community was something none of us wanted to happen,"" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff said, adding the restrictions were the ""best way to stamp out the virus"".  The rest of the country moves to a higher level of alert, with schools and businesses remaining open but people encouraged to find alternative ways of working if possible. The lockdown forced the postponement of two races in sailing's America's Cup, one of the few major sporting events with no restrictions on spectators.  The three community cases were announced earlier on Sunday - a mother, father and daughter from South Auckland. It is unclear how the three contracted Covid. The mother works in the laundry department for an airline catering facility, while New Zealand media said the father was a self-employed tradesman.  New Zealand's Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said his team was ""working under the assumption that it is one of the new variants"". He added that the initial focus on investigations was the mother's workplace ""because of its obvious connections to the border"". Opposition leader Judith Collins urged New Zealanders to follow the advice of health officials.  But she called for border workers to be vaccinated, saying: ""If this proves to be another border failure that is unacceptable. Our border should be rock-solid by now.""

Yellow hearts memorial made by bereaved daughter,"A business owner who lost her father to Covid-19 is creating an art work featuring yellow hearts in memory of people killed by the ""cruel virus"".  Kelly Iles is creating the work in the windows of Enchanted in the Royal Priors shopping centre, Leamington Spa.  More than 100 people have so far asked for their loved ones' names to be included, Mrs Iles said. She wanted to do ""something positive"" to remember her father Ricky Perkins who died last month, aged 65.  He died in hospital on 19 January, when a peak of 1,820 UK deaths from Covid were recorded. ""I have to do positive things to remember him, I don't want it to be all consumed by sadness,"" she said.  Mrs Iles hopes to put hundreds of hearts in the large windows of the premises, one of two themed events venues she runs. ""I don't want all these people to be forgotten,"" she said.  ""I have had hundreds of daughters reach out to be who have lost their dad. I've got three Facebook friends who actually lost a parent on the same day as me."" She has joined an online support group for bereaved relatives and got the art idea from pictures of yellow heart installations in New York. Mrs Iles has appealed for anyone who wants a loved one included to contact her via social media.   Her art work includes dedications to people in their 30s and 40s and she hoped it would ""raise awareness"" that many younger people had died. Mrs Iles was close to her father who ran a metal fabrications business and described him as ""my hero"".  ""He was very hardworking,"" she said. ""He helped me with my business and I went to him for everything.""  Her business was among those which donated meals to NHS staff last year.

Concern for riding-school horses in lockdown,"By Chris WoodBBC News Horses that are usually gentle have been fighting and breaking arena equipment because they are bored in lockdown, a riding school has said. While horse riding itself is not prohibited during Wales' level four lockdown, non-essential businesses like riding schools have had to close. Used to three hours of lessons a day, horses are currently largely confined to their stables. Talygarn Equestrian Centre said their animals were also losing muscle. Amelia Rogers, who runs the facility in Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, with her parents said it had been hit hard financially, selling five of its 27 horses to support the others. ""It's a desperate situation for everyone,"" she said. The British Horse Society in Wales said riding schools were ""the lifeblood of the equestrian industry"" and it wants them to reopen in line with children returning to the classroom to ease the strain. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it was ""continuing to do all we can to protect businesses during these very difficult times"". Prior to the Covid lockdown, 100 people would ride the horses at Talygarn each week during lessons - but the task is currently down to Ms Rogers and three apprentices, who also care for them.  Ms Rogers said: ""We can only give them one form of exercise a day. We can't ride them all, so take them out in groups to get rid of excess energy.  ""Some will start fighting in the arena, when they're bored they also start breaking things, ripping rugs and breaking sections of arena, like fencing."" In the summer the horses were able to run in fields, but these have been unusable during winter months and the animals have been largely confined to their stables. ""We had 27 horses but, after the first lockdown, we cut the numbers down because of the expense of keeping,"" she added. ""The sale brought in income, but the only problem is, when we reopen, replacements will need to be bought. You can't run a riding school without horses."" As well as the challenge of ""breaking up boredom"", Ms Rogers was also concerned horses have lost muscle by not working, which will need to be built back up. She said there were also many other potential issues related to lack of activity - swollen legs, behavioural issues towards humans and other horses, loss of fitness, stiffness, lameness, and repetitive habits caused by boredom, such as wearing down teeth. While there has been some business support during both lockdowns, Ms Rogers said ""costs don't stop like a pub"" - with ""significantly high"" amounts spent on welfare, vet bills, farriers and bedding, while they have been unable to furlough staff and have seen their own income disappear. People in Wales are now able to exercise outdoors with someone from another household - and Ms Rogers said she believed one-to-one socially distanced lessons should now be allowed, both from an animal welfare point of view and also to help businesses financially. In England, a campaign was launched by the Ingestre Stables in Staffordshire to ease restrictions and Ms Rogers said she thought the Welsh Government should take similar measures. ""We're already hearing from schools up and down the country that are losing some of their older horses from ailments that are brought on just by horses standing still and not getting worked,"" said Ingestre's owner Tim Downes. National manager for The British Horse Society in Wales Kathryn Stewart said it had provided almost Â£80,000 support for riding schools and was continuing a public donations campaign to help. It wants centres to reopen when children return to school classrooms, and she added: ""Riding schools are the lifeblood of the equestrian industry and this latest lockdown will cause immense difficulties for them. ""We have been lobbying government throughout the pandemic and will continue working closely with officials to clarify the guidance, along with providing support and information."" RSPCA equine welfare expert Dr Mark Kennedy said: ""Exercise is so important for equines and ensuring their welfare; all horses should have access to a paddock where they can exercise every day, in the company of other horses, for as long as possible.  ""Clearly the weather conditions at the moment can make things more challenging for horse owners, so ridden exercise is also likely to be important for some horses.  ""We continue to call on decision-makers to do everything they can to ensure animal welfare is not unwittingly compromised as a consequence of any restrictions in place."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said Â£1.7bn of finance had helped protect 125,000 jobs since the start of the pandemic.  ""Reducing all physical contact between households to an absolute minimum is vital in order to slow the spread of coronavirus, which will help protect the NHS and, ultimately, save lives,"" she said. ""That's why under alert level four, the general rule is that people must stay at home, except for very limited purposes.""

Coronavirus: Daily briefing,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Sunday morning. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. Dozens of Conservative MPs have written to the prime minister to demand that he commit to removing all Covid-19 legal restrictions by the end of April. The Covid Recovery Group - comprising 63 MPs - says that by this time all nine priority groups are likely to have received the vaccine, so there will be no justification for ""unnecessary restrictions"". The prime minister has suggested he will aim for a ""cautious"" relaxing of rules, not unlike last years's phased removal of measures imposed in the first nationwide lockdown. With the UK on the brink of hitting its target to offer the vaccine to all of the most vulnerable people, invitations for appointments are being extended to a wider range of people in England. People aged 65 to 69 and under-65s in at risk groups are the next to be offered the jab as the rollout is officially expanded beyond the top four priority groups. About 2.4 million people in these categories are expected to receive letters this week inviting them for vaccination. Those in at-risk groups include people with chronic respiratory disease such as obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. Eviction notices cannot be served until the end of March, the government has announced, extending the ban for another six weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the measure struck ""the right balance between protecting tenants and enabling landlords to exercise their right to justice"". The charity Shelter said its research showed almost 445,000 adults renting privately had fallen behind in their payments or been served some kind of eviction notice in the past month. It said the extensions would  ""keep people safe for now"", but warned it was ""not an answer to the evictions crisis"" - as renters still had to repay the arrears. Amanda Holden, the Britain's Got Talent judge and radio host, has said she broke lockdown rules by travelling more than 200 miles to see her parents in Cornwall after a ""distressing"" phone call from her father. Her agent said: ""Amanda is aware of the travel rules and is devastated she had to break them on this one occasion. Lockdown rules ban travel outside your local area and meetings with anyone outside your household, support bubble or childcare bubble - although there are exceptions for caring for vulnerable people or providing emergency assistance. Paula Reynolds met Roberto Fiorillo, the man she hopes to marry, by chance while visiting her daughter in Australia last March. But since then, the pandemic has kept them separated by 10,000 miles, her in Caerphilly, Wales, and him in Perth. Finally a visa came through for her in December, only for her flights to be suddenly cancelled as Australia tightened its restrictions on arrivals. But thanks to a fundraising drive by her colleagues, Paula is now able to cover the inflated cost of a new ticket and the cost of hotel quarantine on her arrival - and be reunited with the man she loves.

Covid memorial walk gets 'heart-warming' support,"A Â£60,000 tree-lined trail to remember people who have died with coronavirus has received ""heart-warming"" support, councils have said. The Memorial Walk will include 58 trees and 16 benches along a 2.5-mile (4km) path in Watermead Country Park, Leicestershire. Money for the scheme was raised through an online crowdfunding campaign, which reached its target in two months. The project is due to be completed in March. Stewart Doughty, head of parks and open spaces at Leicester City Council - which is working on the scheme with the county council - said the public's response had been ""heart-warming"". ""We've been overwhelmed by the way in which people have come together to support this project,"" he said. ""Being outdoors, and being able to enjoy the changing seasons, has helped many of us through the most difficult days of the pandemic. ""We hope this... new trail will provide a space for reflection and remembrance for everyone in Leicester and Leicestershire - and act as a living and lasting memorial to those who have sadly lost their lives."" The scheme will include benches and interpretation boards. The council said 23 trees - a mixture of elm, silver birch, aspen, hornbeam and oak trees - have been planted. Contributors include Leicester-based retailer Dunelm and the charity Leicester Masaya Link Group. Roo Peake, a charity member, said they donated to the cause after a long-time trustee died in March from coronavirus. ""We wanted to celebrate his life,"" she said. ""Michael Gerard was a passionate musician, environmentalist and educator. ""He is in our memories and, when we walk around Watermead Park, he will be in our thoughts for years to come.""

'I thought I was going to lose my dad',"A teenager whose father was in critical care for 54 days with coronavirus said it felt like ""half my world came crashing down"" when he became ill. Dan Ridlington, 42, missed his daughter Ashleigh's 16th birthday after being placed into a coma at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge. He eventually was well enough to leave hospital but has faced a slow recovery. Ashleigh said it was a ""really scary"" time but she had been making positive changes to help her through lockdown. She told her experience to the BBC, as BBC Local Radio unveiled a campaign to raise awareness about children's mental health during the pandemic. The college student, from Luton, said before her father was affected by Covid she ""had a bad attitude towards it"" and did not realise how serious it was. ""The moment I realised it was really hard was when it hit my dad,"" she said. ""When he was taken into hospital because he couldn't breathe I thought I was going to lose my dad. ""It was really scary. I wouldn't want to put anyone through that. It was the most terrifying day of my life."" She said on her 16th birthday, it was ""horrible"" waking up and not having a message from her dad. ""He was in a coma for my birthday and it was terrible, I hated it,"" she said. Mr Ridlington has since been discharged from hospital after having to relearn basic tasks such as walking and talking. He said his recovery was ""very slow"" and he had ""very limited movement"" due to nerve damage caused by Covid. He said he also struggled with shortness of breath. Ashleigh said the pandemic, and particularly the most recent lockdown, had affected her mental health and she was dealing with anxiety. ""I've had no motivation for my online lessons and just feel so tired,"" she said. ""Days feel like they are just rolling into one."" But she said he had been trying to make positive changes, with lockdown stretching through winter. ""Recently I've decided to wake up a bit earlier, I do a face care routine or put my make-up on and try and make myself feel upbeat,"" she said.

How do the coronavirus vaccines in Wales work?,"Will I need to avoid getting pregnant after having the coronavirus vaccine? And can I drink alcohol before or after the jab? We answer some of the common vaccine questions. Three vaccines have been approved for use in the UK so far - Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. Pfizer, which was the first to be authorised and used here, works in a similar way to Moderna, the first batches of which are expected in the spring. They are both called RNA vaccines, which means the genetic code of the virus is made into a vaccine and injected into the body. The vaccine mimics the virus itself and the body's immune system reacts by making antibodies and T-cells. If a person is later exposed to the virus, the body remembers what to do and this triggers an immune response. The Oxford vaccine works in a different way, as it is a viral vector - a genetically modified virus. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus from chimpanzees, which has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it cannot cause illness. Like the other vaccines, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus, should it need to. And all three vaccines require a second dose for longer-lasting protection. The Pfizer jab is not a live vaccine, meaning it does not contain any live viruses - nor does the Moderna one. The Oxford vaccine contains a harmless form of a different virus, which has been altered so it cannot cause an illness. There is no evidence the Covid-19 vaccine is unsafe if you are pregnant, but more evidence is needed that it is safe. That is why pregnant women are not currently being offered the jab - but you can have the vaccine if you are breastfeeding. You do not need to avoid pregnancy after vaccination, and the vaccine cannot give you or your baby Covid. It is normal to feel a bit under the weather after any vaccine, or equally you might escape any side effects at all. Most are mild and should not last longer than a week. According to the NHS, they include: You can take painkillers such as paracetamol if you need to. If you have a high temperature you may have coronavirus or another infection. If your symptoms get worse or you are worried, call 111 or 0845 46 47 if it is not available in your area. The vaccines approved for use in the UK have met strict standards of safety, quality and effectiveness. To be approved in the first place, they have to go through all the clinical trials and safety checks other licensed medicines go through.  Other vaccines are being developed, but they will only be available on the NHS once they have been thoroughly tested to make sure they are safe and effective. So far, reports of serious side effects, such as allergic reactions, have been very rare and no long-term complications have been reported. The alcohol education charity Drinkaware is urging people to get vaccinated whether or not they drink alcohol. But it is also asking people to think of the benefits of not drinking just before and just after being vaccinated. There is no published data about the specific effects of alcohol on the body's response to the jab, Drinkaware says, but there is some evidence that drinking alcohol - especially heavily - could interfere with your body's ability to build immunity. The charity advises people to consider not drinking for two days before and up to two weeks after being vaccinated. It stressed that people should not turn down the jab if they feel unable or unwilling to abstain - and said regular heavy drinkers are at risk of becoming seriously ill if they do contract Covid-19. All over-70s, care home residents and staff, front-line health workers and those extremely vulnerable to the virus were top of the list to be vaccinated against coronavirus. Over-50s and younger people with health conditions that put them at higher risk should follow by the spring, all depending on supplies of the vaccine arriving. All other adults - nearly 1.1 million people - may have to wait until the autumn. The priority groups used in Wales mirror those in the rest of the UK.

Stormont faces bumpy ride to ease NI lockdown,"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter It's been a long and difficult seven weeks since Northern Ireland re-entered lockdown. Predictions of a post-Christmas surge in Covid-19 cases, increased hospital admissions and ultimately a rise in deaths, came true. Restrictions imposed by the executive to relieve pressures have been working and they'll be reviewed on Thursday. But officials are again urging caution about how we exit lockdown. It falls to the five parties that make up Stormont's power-sharing executive to decide whether to extend restrictions beyond 5 March, or begin the process of lifting them. Few on the hill believe lockdown can be eased before Easter, and Health Minister Robin Swann already hinted at that in a previous paper to his executive colleagues. There are several reasons for this. Officials say with St Patrick's Day and the Easter holidays around the corner, they don't want to prematurely allow more opportunities for people to mix, which would likely lead to another rise in cases. At his weekly press briefing, Mr Swann said we ""must not let history repeat itself"", harking back to restrictions being eased for Christmas -  a decision,  he has since said, he regrets. Ministers also have to assess the latest Covid-19 statistics. Northern Ireland has passed the peak of the third wave, but the number of people being treated in hospital for Covid-19 and those requiring intensive care remains high. Then look at Northern Ireland's reproduction (R) number, which measures how quickly the virus is spreading. Although it has fallen from a peak of about 1.9 last month, Mr Swann said it has now ""stabilised and stagnated"" at about 0.75-0.85 in the community. So, while the spread of the virus has been decreasing, experts argue it is not yet close enough to last summer's levels, which allowed the executive to initially ease restrictions. They want the R-number to drop even further, so that reopening can take place with infection levels starting from as low a base as possible. However, there's a recognition that lockdown cannot continue indefinitely, with the public having felt the effects of restrictions much more acutely this time. As one Stormont source put it: ""We have to let the air out of the balloon - but it has to be managed."" Expect to hear phrases like ""baby steps"" more often, as ministers try to maintain a careful balance between the health response and giving people hope. Their new pathway to recovery paper is expected to be published in the coming weeks (we don't know when exactly), but again, it's unlikely to include any indicative dates. It will be a gradual rather than total reopening, permitting one sector at a time and measuring its effects before moving to the next. Many businesses that have been shut for months may find their wait to reopen again getting longer, and the executive will have to consider extra financial support for those sectors being told to stay closed. There are other new factors that ministers also have to weigh up while making their decisions. NI's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride raised eyebrows on Tuesday when he said some restrictions would likely be needed until 2022. But it was what he said about new variants of coronavirus that will play into the politicians' thinking around relaxing the lockdown. It's believed at least 50% of current Covid-19 cases in NI are related to the more transmissible variant that was detected in Kent before Christmas. Dr McBride pointed out that Stormont has ""no experience"" of relaxing restrictions with a new variant present, and as long as the pandemic continues, more mutations are likely to emerge and hinder recovery from lockdown. Northern Ireland is undoubtedly in a different place than last June, when the idea of having vaccines to combat Covid-19 seemed a far-off prospect. The vaccination programme has been moving well, with more than 370,000 people in Northern Ireland having received their first jab. There is an argument that as more vulnerable people are vaccinated, that should make it easier for restrictions to be lifted to allow some elements of pre-Covid life to resume. Stormont ministers will take that on board, but they're likely to be advised that the effects of the programme have yet to be properly felt to allow a wider lifting of restrictions. Most schools in Northern Ireland are currently set to reopen on 8 March, in line with other parts of the UK. But if the executive agrees to extend lockdown until Easter that could mean homeschooling and remote learning remain for longer too. On Tuesday, Dr McBride said officials believe the effect of schools on the R-number is between 0.3-0.6. When it comes to keeping R below one, every little helps and that figure may give some ministers pause for thought. However, the executive previously said its top priority was to keep schools open, so perhaps it could agree to impose further safety mitigations or introduce a phased return for some key year groups. Stormont's politicians are always keen to take a temperature check on the ground when deciding how to manage restrictions. The previous rows within the executive about imposing restrictions, at a time when the Covid situation was deteriorating, drew widespread criticism. In November, the DUP was left politically isolated when it twice deployed a cross-community veto to block an extension of restrictions. But with a perception some people are running out of patience with the lockdown as things are improving again - could that influence some in the executive to now demand a faster reopening? Whatever happens, Stormont ministers are tasked with making decisions that have only got harder since the onset of the pandemic 11 months ago. Helping Northern Ireland navigate a way out of all this remains a bumpy ride.

China 'refused access' to key Covid data for WHO,"China refused to hand over key data to the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of Covid-19, one of its members has said. Microbiologist Dominic Dwyer told Reuters, the Wall St Journal and the New York Times the team requested raw patient data from early cases, what he called ""standard practice"". He said they only received a summary.  China has not responded to the allegation but has previously insisted it was transparent with the WHO.  The US has urged China to make available data from the earliest stages of the outbreak, saying it has ""deep concerns"" about the WHO report.   Last week, the WHO team concluded it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the coronavirus leaked from a lab in the city of Wuhan, dismissing a controversial theory that emerged last year. Wuhan was the first place in the world where the virus was detected, in late 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. The investigators had asked for raw data on the 174 identified cases of Covid-19 from Wuhan in December 2019, Professor Dwyer told Reuters.  Only half of the early cases had been exposed to the seafood market where the virus was initially detected.  ""That's why we've persisted to ask for that,"" Prof Dwyer said. ""Why that doesn't happen, I couldn't comment. Whether it's political or time or it's difficult... But whether there are any other reasons why the data isn't available, I don't know. One would only speculate."" Thea Kolsen Fischer, a Danish immunologist who was also part of the WHO team, told the New York Times that she saw the investigation as ""highly geopolitical"".  ""Everybody knows how much pressure there is on China to be open to an investigation and also how much blame there might be associated with this,"" she said. Prof Dwyer said the restrictions on data would be mentioned in the WHO team's final report, which could be released as early as next week.  The team arrived in early January and spent four weeks in China - the first two in hotel quarantine.  Beijing has insisted it was transparent with the WHO investigators, whose visit began only after months of negotiations. The experts were closely monitored by the Chinese authorities.  The US accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, which restricted the freedom of the WHO team to travel and interview witnesses, including community members, on health grounds.  The investigators told the New York Times that disagreements, including over access to patient records, were so tense that they sometimes erupted into shouting matches.  Last month, an interim report from the WHO criticised China's initial response, saying that ""public health measures could have been applied more forcefully"". The WHO team has also called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the theory the virus could have spread through the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia.

Amanda Holden 'devastated' at lockdown rule break,"Britain's Got Talent judge Amanda Holden has said she is ""devastated"" at breaking lockdown rules by travelling to see her parents in Cornwall. She made the trip of more than 200 miles after receiving a ""distressing"" phone call from her father, her agent said in a statement. Travel is banned except for essential journeys under coronavirus regulations. The Sun, which first reported the story, said neighbours in Cornwall complained to police. Holden's agent said ""on balance"" the TV star and radio host felt the round-trip from London to Cornwall was necessary to deal with an issue at her parents' home. ""Amanda is aware that all families are going through difficulty during these turbulent times but received a distressing telephone call from her elderly father on Friday afternoon,"" the statement said. It said she did not ""act on a whim"" and has followed coronavirus regulations ""every step of the way"" in England's three lockdowns. ""Amanda is aware of the travel rules and is devastated she had to break them on this one occasion,"" her agent said. She is now back in London. Under the rules of the current lockdown, travel outside your local area is banned unless it is essential and people may only meet others in their household, support bubble or childcare bubble. However, there are exceptions for providing care for disabled or vulnerable people or to provide emergency assistance. Holden's parents have both received vaccines and she is being tested weekly, so she felt she was not putting her parents at risk, the statement said. The presenter had been working on her Heart Radio show earlier on Friday, where she was presented with gifts to mark her 50th birthday, which is on Tuesday.

Eviction ban in England extended until March,"The ban on evictions in England is to be extended until the end of March, the government has announced. It means eviction notices - which could have started again on 22 February - cannot be served for another six weeks. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said it would ensure renters remained protected ""during this difficult time"". The eviction ban had already been extended from 11 January when it was originally due to expire. Mr Jenrick said the ban on the enforcement of evictions by bailiffs would continue ""in all but the most serious cases"". He added that the government had taken unprecedented action to support renters during the Covid pandemic, and that measures had struck ""the right balance between protecting tenants and enabling landlords to exercise their right to justice"". But Labour, charities and landlords groups said the measures did not go far enough. Shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said: ""Last minute decisions and half-measures from the government are putting people's homes at risk.   ""Ministers promised nobody would lose their home because of coronavirus, but the current ban isn't working.  ""The government should give people security in their homes, by strengthening and extending the ban for the period [virus] restrictions are in place."" Huge sums of money have been pumped into the economy to stop mass unemployment and keep the economy afloat.  But the government has stopped short of direct financial support for tenants in rent arrears, and landlords losing income.  While I'm told some within Whitehall are receptive to the idea of emergency grants or loans, the policy has met significant resistance - and there's little sign Westminster will follow Wales and Scotland's lead.  But there is concern from groups representing tenants and landlords that a rent debt crisis is mounting - which will, in the end, see many people forced from their homes.  Mortgage holidays and mediation have helped many get by for the time being - but some argue that a longer-term policy is needed.  Banning evictions for another six weeks may bring some temporary relief, but as one frustrated Conservative MP put it to me: ""This can't go on forever."" Shelter said its research showed almost 445,000 private renting adults in England had fallen behind on their rent or been served with some kind of eviction notice in the last month. The housing and homelessness charity's chief executive Polly Neate said the extension would ""keep people safe for now"", but warned it was ""not an answer to the evictions crisis"".  ""Renters are still are being served with eviction notices every day and our helpline is flooded with calls from those desperately worried about paying their rent,"" she said. ""Before the ban is lifted, the government must give renters a real way out of debt. That means a lifeline of emergency grants to help pay off 'Covid arrears' so people can avoid the terrifying risk of eviction altogether."" Meanwhile, National Residential Landlords Association chief executive Ben Beadle warned the announcement was storing up future problems. He said 800,000 private renters had built up arrears since the ban came into force, which they would struggle to ever pay off. ""It will lead eventually to them having to leave their home and face serious damage to their credit scores,"" he said, as he called for further financial support to combat ""the debt crisis renters and landlords are now facing"". Housing is a devolved issue, and Wales and Scotland have already extended their bans to the end of March. In Northern Ireland, landlords are required to give tenants 12 weeks' notice to quit, before moving to eviction proceedings. The rules were extended to March in anticipation of the second wave of the Covid pandemic. Evictions were first banned at the start of the first lockdown in March, with ministers also extending the notice period landlords must give tenants to end their tenancy from three to six months. Courts began to clear the backlog of repossession cases in September, starting with the most serious cases, such as those involving domestic violence or anti-social behaviour. But the housing secretary then called a so-called ""Christmas truce"", meaning bailiffs were not allowed to enforce possession orders between 11 December and 11 January.

From fine dining to selling £16 takeaway burgers,"By Lauren HirstBBC News At the start of the latest Covid lockdown, Manchester's only Michelin-starred chef Simon Martin joked that he might have to start serving takeaway burgers to save the business. The city had been subject to the strictest of Covid-19 restrictions for months and restaurants had been forced to close, with many turning to delivery and takeaway for the first time to make ends meet.  Before the pandemic, Martin could never have predicted that Mana - which served dishes such as sea urchin chawanmushi (a Japanese egg custard in case you were wondering), mangalitza pork broth and native coriander - would turn to the humble burger as a way to stay afloat. But, he says, these are unpredictable times.  He adds the concept ""actually began as a bit of a joke at the end of last year"".  ""We were joking about it and then we found out that we wouldn't be reopening for Christmas and New Year and it suddenly turned into quite a serious discussion."" Six months before the pandemic's impact was first felt, Martin had celebrated earning the city's first Michelin star in more 40 years. He was preparing to move the restaurant forward, but during the first national lockdown he admits he ""just didn't really see anything other than the restaurant being open in its usual format"". Faced with the possibility of many more months of restrictions, though, he knew remaining closed was no longer an option. ""We have fixed costs and, regardless of the amount of support we had from suppliers, landlords, all the government initiatives and the furlough, it all cost us money still. ""Nothing is free; we can't just permanently stay closed and expect us to stay afloat.""  That's when the joke about burgers stopped being a laughing matter. While different to the typical dishes served in the restaurant, he was determined that it would live up to Mana's reputation. And so the Â£16 Mana burger - a Cumbrian beef patty in a potato bun, smothered in American-style cheese made with beer from nearby brewery Cloudwater, smoked egg yolks and green onion paste - was born. ""When we decided what we wanted to do, it needed to be something that was accessible and approachable and there's not many people out there who don't like a burger,"" he explains. Mana is not alone among the country's elite restaurants in embracing new ways of working in order to survive the pandemic. Situated on the edge of the Ribble Valley in Lancashire, Northcote has held a Michelin star for more than 20 years.  Executive chef and Great British Menu regular Lisa Goodwin-Allen got a taste of creating food boxes during the BBC show, which was impacted by Covid restrictions and saw her produce versions of her winning dishes for the celebratory banquet guests to finish at home. Goodwin-Allen admits the challenge to adapt has been a ""learning curve"", with the restaurant now serving gourmet boxes, priced at about Â£105, that are prepared, packaged and sent out to customers across the UK to finish at home. ""I wanted to capture a piece of me and Northcote, but then you also have to think about how it arrives,"" she says. She says the boxes needed to be ""something that you wouldn't necessarily do at home"", but were also easy to put together and ""exciting"". That has meant sending out dishes such as salt-aged beef with marrowbone crust, smoked pancetta, mushroom bourguignon (a stew made with red wine) and a beef-fat ""chip"". But she adds the boxes, which ""sell out straightaway"", are limited to 350 a week to preserve the ""quality"" the restaurant, which normally serves between 420 to 450 guests a week, is known for. Fellow chef Tom Parker trained at the Lancashire restaurant, but now runs The White Swan over in Fence, near Burnley, which received a Michelin star in 2019. He too decided to embrace food boxes after the second national lockdown, but with a more targeted market in mind, as his offering is collection only, aimed at the locals who have become the pub's regulars.  Parker says the move was ""just about keeping our name out there and doing something for the local people"". While he accepts the Â£90 price tag ""is a lot for people to spend on a takeaway"", he says the restaurant is ""not cutting corners"". He adds the cost is justified as the boxes use the same quality of ingredients used in the restaurant and offer something different - the last was a collaboration with Alderley Edge's Yu restaurant which included char sui suckling pig with smoked onions, pak choi with soy and salted miso caramel chocolate.  He adds that the key to the success of the boxes is to ""make sure it's simple for people to do at home"", but admits he cannot see a market for them beyond the end of the pandemic.

South Africa to lift Covid border closures,"South Africa says it will on Monday reopen 20 of its land border crossings that were shut last month to try to stop the spread of Covid-19 infections.  The decision was taken at a cabinet meeting on Saturday. South Africa has been hit hard by a second wave of the outbreak linked to a new variant of the disease. It has recorded almost 1.5 million infections and more than 47,000 Covid-related deaths - by far the highest toll in Africa. Globally, more than 108 million cases have been confirmed since the start of the outbreak late in 2019, with nearly 2.3 million deaths, according to America's Johns Hopkins University. In other developments: On Saturday, the government announced that borders with Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mozambique, Namibia, Lesotho and Eswatini would be opened. ""The active and orderly management of people through our borders is an important part of the country's overall risk adjusted approach to control the spread of Covid-19,"" said Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi. But the minister warned that all those wanting to cross the borders must produce proof of negative Covid tests taken recently.  Mr Motsoaledi said he would personally visit the four busiest crossings to observe the processing of travellers. South Africa shut its borders with neighbouring countries on 11 January after the new variant of Covid-19 was detected. A number of countries have since banned all travel to and from South Africa.

Covid jabs extended to all over-65s from Monday,"People aged 65 to 69 in England are among those being invited to book their Covid-19 jab as the vaccination programme enters a new phase on Monday.  The clinically vulnerable are also being offered the jab as the vaccine rollout is officially expanded beyond the top four priority groups.  The UK is on track to offer the jab to all of the most vulnerable people by Monday, ministers have said. So far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose . Almost 1.2 million letters were due to have landed on the doorsteps of over-65s and the clinically vulnerable by Saturday asking people to log on to the national booking service, NHS England said.  A further 1.2 million are due to arrive this week. Those who receive a letter can choose from more than 100 vaccination centres or almost 200 pharmacy services. GP-led vaccination sites will focus initially on the clinically vulnerable because of the relationship between general practice and those with long-term conditions. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation defines clinically vulnerable people as those with conditions including chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and severe asthma. Until now, the vaccination programme has been aimed at NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, along with over-70s and people deemed clinically extremely vulnerable. However, some regions have already started vaccinating people aged 65 to 69, with NHS England having previously said that people in this age group could get a vaccine if GPs have supplies. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccination programme has already protected more than 12 million of the most vulnerable people against Covid. ""This is an exciting moment as we now move on to those aged 65 and over and the clinically vulnerable as part of our plan to vaccinate as many people as possible who can benefit from it,"" he said. ""However, if you have already been offered a jab but have not taken it up it is not too late. Please come forward and help us to help."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The vaccination programme is continuing at an unprecedented speed and, as we're on target to offer vaccines to all those in the first four priority groups by Monday, we are determined to keep up the momentum by expanding it even further.""  Speaking at a vaccination bus in Greenwich, south-east London, Prof Stephen Powis, the national medical director of NHS England, urged everyone who receives a letter to get the vaccine without hesitation. He said officials had been working with faith groups and local community leaders to encourage everybody to come forward. ""Don't hesitate at all. These vaccines are safe, they're effective against Covid, they'll protect you, they'll protect your loved ones, and of course they'll help get society back to normal again,"" he said. Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said his country had begun contacting some over-50s, while Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she expects many in the 65-69 age group to have had their first jab by the middle of this month after the vast majority of older people were vaccinated. In Northern Ireland, the Department of Health is offering everyone over 65 a vaccine by the end of February as it works its way through priority groups four and five, although it is expected to help the UK meet its overall target. On Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the ""huge progress"" made with the vaccine rollout, saying he was ""optimistic"" about being able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown. He said ministers were hopeful schools can reopen from 8 March, with the government looking to open non-essential shops after this and then the hospitality sector. However, scientists have warned against easing restrictions too quickly when the PM sets out his ""road map"" out of lockdown on 22 February. The UK's vaccination programme began on 8 December 2020 with people receiving the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. From 4 January people began receiving the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine. Both vaccines, which require two doses for full protection, were approved by the UK's medicines regulator. A decision was taken by health officials to offer a first dose to as many vulnerable people as possible by extending the gap between doses from three to four weeks to closer to 12 weeks.

Ten more Covid-19-linked deaths recorded in NI,"Another 10 people have died with Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health has said. That takes the department's total to 1,985 since the pandemic began. In the past day another 303 people tested positive for coronavirus, taking the total in the past year to 108,737. There are 470 inpatients with coronavirus in Northern Ireland's hospitals, of whom 59 are in intensive care units. Official data from the Department of Health showed Northern Ireland's hospitals are operating at 92% capacity. As of Thursday, 373,414 people in Northern Ireland had received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. In the Republic of Ireland, another 66 Covid-19-related deaths were recorded on Saturday and another 1,078 people tested positive for the virus.  The country's Health Service Executive has said almost all GPs and practice nurses should have received at least their first vaccine dose by the end of Sunday. Almost 5,000 doses of the Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are being administered at vaccination centres around the country. The HSE's chief clinical officer Dr Colm Henry said: ""Completing the programme for GPs and practice nurses will allow them in turn to vaccinate the over-70s. ""In order to vaccinate the over-70s, we need to ensure GPs and practice nurses themselves are vaccinated."" As of Saturday there have been 3,931 Covid-related deaths and 208,796 confirmed cases of coronavirus.

Lovers forced by pandemic to either end of earth,"By Ollie Pritchard-JonesBBC News ""It was heart-breaking. All our hopes and dreams seemed over."" When Paula Reynolds landed back in Wales from Australia in March 2020, after meeting by chance the man she hopes to marry, the world still seemed normal. The grandmother-of-three had met Roberto Fiorillo online while visiting her daughter in Perth - and planned to return as soon as she could renew her visa. But just weeks after touching down, the coronavirus pandemic struck and Paula and Roberto were plunged into the travails of a love affair separated by 10,000 miles. ""We were planning a joint 50th party, an engagement party and he was going to meet my family in Wales,"" Paula, who lives in Caerphilly, continued. ""It was just crushing. It was hard to have a conversation some days because I'd get upset. It took us a while to pull ourselves together and refocus and do what we're going to do."" Paula had thought getting the visa sorted out would be her biggest problem, along with making sure she had the cash to buy the return flight. But travelling on a tourist visa was banned when Australia tightened its borders to try and control the spread of Covid-19. This scuppered her original plan of getting a family tourist visa and then applying for an onshore partner visa last June - which was when she initially anticipated she would be able to return to Australia. But lockdown forced her to apply for an offshore partner visa - which can take up to two years to be granted. Paula applied and held her breath, not expecting to get approval for at least a year. But she was amazed to discover that one had been granted on 1 December. This was a permanent visa which would allow her to claim citizenship after two years. Over the moon, Paula booked a one-way flight to Melbourne from Heathrow leaving on 23 January, for Â£1,895, the next day. She handed in her notice at B&M Bargains where she had been working in Blackwood, packed her bags and was isolating when Australia's travel restrictions were tightened after Christmas. The country had now reduced the cap on the number of people it was letting in. Singapore Airlines reduced the number of tickets for the flight the mother-of-two was was due to travel on and Paula was devastated to discovered that her ticket had been cancelled ""without explanation"". She was able to get her money back but, with fewer people able to travel, the price of flights surged. Paula said that before the pandemic she had no issue sourcing return flights to Australia for Â£700. But suddenly, the only flight she could find in February cost Â£5,000, she said. A flight on 14 March cost marginally less at Â£3,720. And knowing how quickly they were selling, Paula immediately maxed out her credit card to book it. She will also have to pay $3,000AUS (Â£1,717) to quarantine for 14 days when she arrives. Knowing how much she was struggling, her colleagues at B&M created a GoFundMe page. It has already raised Â£1,000 meaning that Paula can leave the country ""debt free"". She will also be able to pay her quarantine fee in instalments and get a job with her visa - which she plans to do ""straight away"". Despite now having her ticket and visa, Paula knows her ticket could be removed ""at any moment"" if Covid restrictions lead to a reduction in the number of people Australia is letting in. ""I am absolutely overwhelmed with the response of human beings across south Wales who have given money to a stranger. Through all of this there is still humanity,"" she said. ""My boss Chanice Lack has been amazing. I've got two pay cheques before I leave and, with the money raised, I'll definitely leave the country debt free. ""My partner and I can pay the $3,000 off in instalments. Hopefully I'll have a job in Australia within a month so I can pay it off."" A spokeswoman for Singapore Airlines apologised for ""any distress that the cancellation will have caused"". She said it was ""beyond Singapore Airlines' control"" when Paula's seat was cancelled due to restrictions preventing UK residents ""transiting through Singapore unless they are booked on a same-plane service (where transit customers do not disembark during the stop in Singapore)"". A voicemail was left for Paula when airline staff called to advise her of the situation and support is being offered to her, the spokeswoman added.

No fines despite fly-tipping complaints on rise,"No fly tipping fines were issued in one Welsh council area in 2020, despite an increase in reports.  Despite complaints rising by about 13% on 2019, Blaenau Gwent council admitted it was hampered by the pandemic, which may have led to evidence being lost. According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS), there were 1,325 complaints about fly tipping last year, up from 1,168 in 2019. There were just two fly tipping prosecutions carried out in 2019.  The council also issued just 186 littering fines in 2020, compared to 805 the previous year.  Labour councillor John Morgan said it was ""extremely disappointing"" that no fines were issued, but he understood the impact of the pandemic on the situation. ""The fact that no penalty notices have been issued is letting the general public down, but it's also letting the council workforce down who are out there clearing up fly-tipping,"" he said. Joanna Wilkins, the council's executive member for the environment, admitted the pandemic had brought ""significant and unprecedented"" challenges.  ""Covid safety measures means enforcement work in relation to fly-tipping investigations have to be carried out in a way that minimises the risk of further spreading the virus,"" she said. ""The removal and safe disposal of potentially infectious waste was our priority during the early stages of the pandemic and this meant that some evidence that would have normally been recovered from the waste may have subsequently been lost."" She added the council has a ""number"" of active investigations under way.

'Optimistic' PM plots 'cautious' lockdown easing,"Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown. The prime minister said ""huge progress"" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March. After this, the government would look to open non-essential shops and then later the hospitality sector, he said.  It comes as scientists warned against easing lockdown measures too quickly. Mr Johnson will set out his ""road map"" out of lockdown on 22 February. So far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine, according to Saturday's government figures.  The government is aiming to offer a first jab to everyone in the top four priority groups - about 15 million people - by Monday. The figures also show a further 612 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 116,908.  Speaking at a visit to the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies plant in Billingham, Teesside, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you. I'm optimistic but we have to be cautious."" Setting out the government's priorities, he said: ""Our children's education is our number one priority, but then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can prudently and cautiously, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease.  ""We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret,"" the PM added. He also echoed comments made earlier by Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Covid-19 could become an illness that we live with - like the flu - by the end of the year. ""A nasty disease like this will roll through. A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I do think that in due time it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable."" Mr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph that he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a ""treatable disease"", and one that we live with ""like we do the flu"". This suggested that he was ruling out a ""zero Covid"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK. However, scientists said coronavirus mutations were getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"" and warned against treating it like the flu. Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: ""It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty."" She added: ""The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous."" Prof Steven Riley, a member of the SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""If for some reason we were to choose to just pretend it (coronavirus) wasn't here anymore, then there is the potential to go back to a wave that is a similar size to the one that we are in now."" Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines were ""doing what we wanted them to do"", particularly among the very elderly and vulnerable, who were among the first to receive the jab. Although acknowledging that it was ""desperately important"" for schools to return and society to reopen, he cautioned against getting into a cycle ""where we are constantly opening up and then closing down again and everything is very unstable"". ""It's worse to open up, have another wave of pandemic, another bunch of hospitalisations and have to close down again than to be able to progressively normalise things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. NHS Confederation chairman Lord Victor Adebowale said 8 March for schools could still be too soon, adding that the NHS workforce was ""on its knees"". ""I understand the pressure to open schools. We need to do so very safely. I think mid or late March is when we should be reassessing. ""We have had a number of false dawns when we have set dates, taken the action, then find ourselves having to row back very quickly,"" Lord Adebowale told Today. But the prime minister is facing calls from some MPs in his party to ease restrictions. Meanwhile, UK Hospitality said for every week the hospitality sector remains shut down more companies are being placed in jeopardy and millions of jobs across hospitality and the supply chain are being put at risk. The trade association's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""That is why we urge the prime minister to work with us on delivering a safe, swift and sustainable exit from lockdown for hospitality.""

Man held after police break up canal boat party,"A man has been arrested and 26 people reported for Â£800 fines after police broke up a party on a canal boat. Some 30 people were discovered on the vessel on the River Lea in east London at about 04:20 GMT. The Met said a 31-year-old held on suspicion of breaching Covid health protection regulations had previously been reported for a Â£10,000 fine over another boat party. The partygoers were dispersed and the boat has been seized. Ch Insp Pete Shaw said it was ""incredibly disappointing that incidents of this nature continue"". ""To have an individual who has repeatedly ignored these regulations and who appears to have organised multiple events is dangerous and indicates a complete disregard for the safety of all involved,"" he said. Met Police officers also shut down another large party in a house in Wandsworth, south-west London, on Thursday night. About 30 to 40 people were found at the gathering shortly before 23:40. One woman was arrested for breaching Covid regulations while a man was held for an unrelated offence. Fixed-penalty notices were issued to the other attendees found there.

Secondary pupils could face two-metre distance rule,"Pupils who begin a phased return to secondary school later this month could face two-metre social distancing rules. A Scottish government advisory group says the ""additional protective measure"" should also apply on school buses. The two-metre rule is already in place for teachers at secondary schools, while primary pupils should observe it ""whenever possible"". Scotland's youngest pupils are likely to return full-time from 22 February. Some senior secondary pupils could also be back in the classroom from the same date to complete practical work in certain subjects. The tougher new social distancing guidelines have been put forward by the government's advisory group on education and children's issues. Education Secretary John Swinney described the proposals as ""an important scientific and clinical update"". They are in addition to advice that there should be two-metre distancing between adults not from the same household within primary schools. Lateral flow home testing kits will also be offered to primary, secondary, special school, early learning and childcare staff at local authority, independent and grant-aided schools.  The government advice calls for ""a combination of approaches that prevent crowding"" within schools. These include classroom distancing and staggered start times ""especially in older age groups"". Scotland's largest teachers' union has called for the new social distancing proposals to be extended to also include younger pupils. EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""We are concerned about the new (Covid) variant and its impact on transmissibility amongst young people. ""So we think that mitigations beyond that from the advisory group are required - the use of medical-grade face masks, for example. ""We would support physical distancing amongst young people as well as secondary-aged pupils, and we are pressing the Scottish government on these issues before schools reopen."" The Scottish Conservatives said any proposals which accelerate pupils returning to classrooms were to be welcomed. But the party's education spokesman Jamie Greene added: ""In reality, universal social distancing will be very difficult for many councils to deliver and SNP ministers will have known that for a long time. ""We need to see what measures they have taken to support schools to introduce social distancing, as this issue has been consistently flagged for months."" Covid restriction rules introduced for schools last October meant senior pupils and their teachers had to wear face coverings in classrooms. Prior to that, secondary pupils and staff only had to wear face masks when moving about within the school and on school buses. They were encouraged to social distance ""where possible"" but there were no formal distancing rules for pupils. One-way systems were introduced in corridors and physical contact including hugging and high-fiving was ruled out. Schools across Scotland have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since the Christmas holidays, with learning being done at home and online. The first children back in school on 22 February are expected to be all pupils in P1-P3 as well as pre-school children. There will also be a part-time return, but on a very limited basis, for senior secondary pupils to allow them to complete work for national qualifications. Only between 5% and 8% of a secondary school's pupil roll will be able to be present at any one time. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has stressed that the reopening of schools was dependent on the continued suppression of coronavirus.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-56052692,1
'Significant gaps' in hotel quarantine plan,"""Significant gaps"" remain in the hotel quarantine plan that comes into force on Monday, Heathrow Airport has said.  Travellers arriving in England from 33 high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. But the airport said ministers needed to ensure appropriate measures were in place to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and airport staff.  The government said it was working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arose. UK nationals and Irish residents returning from the ""red list"" - mainly consisting of countries in South America and Africa, plus Portugal - will have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels to try to stop new coronavirus variants entering the country. They will have to pay Â£1,750 for their stay, which covers the cost of the hotel, transport and testing, and book it in advance using a government portal. Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. But, less than two days away from the measures coming into effect, Heathrow said it had yet to receive ""necessary reassurances"" from the government. A spokesman said: ""We have been working hard with the government to try to ensure the successful implementation of the policy from Monday, but some significant gaps remain.  ""Ministers must ensure there is adequate resource and appropriate protocols in place for each step of the full end-to-end process from aircraft to hotel to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport.""  The airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers.  The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Regulations for the hotel quarantine measures, which come into force from 04:00 on Monday, have have now been published. But on Friday the Immigration Services Union said its officials had yet to receive guidance on how the system would work.  The union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. It also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. And the GMB union has warned that ""rushed"" government plans are not thorough enough to make sure workers on the front line in quarantine hotels are protected. The union said security guards were one of the occupations worst hit by Covid deaths, adding that it wanted to meet employers to develop a strategy to better protect workers. Meanwhile, a family returning to the UK after four years living in Abu Dhabi have said travellers should not be used as ""guinea pigs"", amid confusion over hotel quarantine rules. Beckie Morris, 30, planned to repatriate to the UK with husband Matthew and their five-week-old daughter, but they now face a quarantine bill of thousands of pounds if they do. The new mother said there was ""no information"" on the government website about what to do with young children. She said: ""We'd have to arrange all the formula. I don't know what we do about sterilising bottles, or nappies or washing their clothes - there's all this unknown. I tried to reach out, and I know it's still really early days, but there's just no information. ""They haven't really laid out what actually happens when you get to that hotel and I don't think that's going to be known until the first person goes in there. ""People shouldn't be used as guinea pigs - especially not paying that amount, that is an extortionate amount of money."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK. ""We are working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arise and ensure the new process runs as smoothly as possible, and we are clear the safety of all staff and passengers is a priority.""

'I can't imagine being in a crowd again',"By Carys BetteleyBBC News As the vaccine rollout gathers pace and coronavirus rates drop across Wales, it's natural to start to picture ""normal life"" again. And while we don't know if and when all restrictions will be lifted with coronavirus no longer a part of our daily lives - whether it takes months or years - will we adapt easily? Or has keeping our distance from strangers become engrained? Will we recoil if a stranger leans over us to reach an item in a shop? And will hand sanitising be a knee-jerk reaction after touching a table in a pub? Will shaking someone's hand or a friendly hug become a thing of the past? And if so - is that a good thing or a bad thing? While some may immediately forget social distancing, sanitising and masks as restrictions lift, student Olivia Grist cannot imagine feeling comfortable in her old life again. ""The thought of being back amongst crowds gives me anxiety,"" she said. ""I haven't really been out of my house since I moved home from university apart from walking my dog, but even then in an open space if someone comes too close I find myself panicking and moving back. ""I feel rude doing it, but it's become an automatic response now."" Olivia, 21, sees her future in stark contrast to her pre-pandemic life. ""I don't understand how before Covid I could happily spend hours at a night club for example, crammed against people having their sweat dripped on me. ""I thought I'd be desperate to go back to that sort of normality being a uni student, but actually it's going to take me a while. ""I feel like I'm going to forever feel the need to wear a mask in public places, even if there's no need any more."" Olivia, who studies journalism at the University of South Wales, does not feel she will leave the extra hygiene measures of the pandemic behind. ""If I'm honest, I think it's brought in precautions and safety measures that should've already been in place but it's taken a pandemic for us to realise that. ""I haven't had a cold this winter, when I'd usually spend most of it full up with one. ""In the future I think I will always be wary of the health repercussions being out and about could have. It will take me a while before I don't panic if someone comes too close to me."" Nicola Gray, a psychology professor at Swansea University, agrees habits could become long term - especially for people who felt they or a loved one were particularly vulnerable to the virus. ""It totally depends on a person's personality, some people are more anxious and sensitive than others and were naturally made that way,"" she said. ""Covid deniers, people who don't believe the virus exists, won't see any risk so they're not going to change their behaviours at all, or young people with no risks and no-one vulnerable in the family won't see the need to restrict their own freedoms."" Olivia is also worried that the lockdown, and lingering fears about contact, will affect families. ""Before the pandemic I would visit my nan, who lives alone, multiple times a week and would often stay the night to keep her company. ""Obviously then I had to stop, but even when we've been allowed to form a bubble with a single household she has told me she doesn't want me there."" Olivia added: ""I understand why and it doesn't offend me, but I can definitely see how it can cause a rift between people."" Author Jess Childs, who wrote a book to help children deal with grief after experiencing bereavements before and during the pandemic, said she too had ""no desire"" to be in a crowd again. ""I've never been that paranoid about the virus itself but I don't feel like I'll be drawn back to large crowds easily,"" she said. ""Partly because I've got out of the habit and also because being at home so much has made me reassess how I spend my spare time anyway."" Jess, who grew up near Hay-on-Wye, Powys, but now lives near Cardiff, said watching TV filmed before the pandemic can now feel strange. ""It does feel a bit odd when you see larger groups congregating on a TV screen without a problem, particularly if those scenes are sad or depict a situation like a wedding or a funeral where family would normally be coming together without a problem. ""All we have wanted as a family in the past year or so has been to be together as much as we can, and to think how easy it used to be is a bit strange after all this time."" One of the bigger challenges mother-of-two Jess, 39, feels she will face is getting used to not wearing a mask. ""I saw a man in the post office the other day not wearing one, hopefully for medical reasons, and I was keen to distance myself and get out of there, which surprised me a bit. ""I'm not at all high risk and I've also had the virus, but it's still going to take a while for old habits to die hard, I think."" Prof Gray said the pandemic had added a whole new layer of risk evaluation to our daily lives. ""Now we're thinking 'what if someone in this shop has Covid? What if someone with Covid touched this loaf of bread and now I've touched it and Covid's on my hand and I've touched my face?' ""It's a whole extra layer of evaluating risk, and questioning 'how much do I actually want to do it?'"" For Rhian Daniell, who works at Alexanders Estate Agents in Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, normal life will resume but the caution will stay with her. ""2020 was the year when everything changed. There was fear and anxiety with record levels of stress,"" she said. Some forms of her old life continued, as there were periods she was able to continue with house viewings and helping people move homes. ""I think moving forward, the staff in the industry will be more cautious and considerate when attending properties. ""This will still involve wiping down surfaces, door handles and doing what we can to prevent other illnesses such as the common cold."" ""I will return to restaurants, shops, offices and I will still travel. I think it will take time, but lockdown has affected people's psychology,"" she added. ""The connection between crowds and viruses has become so entrenched in the public that just the sight of a large group can cause fear and anxiety."" Prof Gray agrees that living long-term under the shadow of the pandemic may cause long-term behavioural change, but said the extent depended on people's personalities and the level of risk they felt they, or a loved-one, faced. ""But is it a bad thing that we're still worried about washing our hands and who might be breathing on us and what we're touching? ""It could well be a good thing. Many people die of flu and other diseases and maybe that awareness will keep those rates down.""

South Africa variant found in Hampshire village,"A case of the South African variant of Covid-19 has been identified in a village in Hampshire. Anyone aged 16 or over  in Bramley, near Basingstoke, will be subjected to surge testing from next week. Additional tests will also be held in Middlesbrough and Walsall following recent discoveries of the variant first identified in South Africa. Concerns have been raised that the mutation can spread faster and vaccines may not be as effective. Mass testing - or surge testing - is already taking place in parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. It will now be deployed to targeted areas of Middlesbrough in the TS7 postcode, areas in Walsall and areas in the RG26 postcode in Hampshire. Simon Bryant, Hampshire County Council's director of public health, said: ""I appreciate that this news may be worrying but it's really important to understand that the risk of transmission from this single case is considered to be very low."" He added that the rapid local testing programme was ""primarily a precautionary measure"" to help the government understand and prevent the spread of new variants.  Details of how the programme will work will be published on the authority's website early next week.  A test centre has been set up in Middlesbrough and anyone over 16 from Marton and Coulby Newham is being urged to get a test. The Teesside town has the fifth highest infection rate in England. Public Health England said as of 8 February, the rate per 100,000 people in Middlesbrough was 357.5 - down slightly from 359.6 the week before. Consultant in public health Esther Mireku said: ""While the overall Covid infection rate in Middlesbrough has now halved from its peak in early January, it has still not decreased as much as we would have liked. ""The high prevalence of Covid in the town, combined with the reporting of this variant, are a reminder to everyone of the importance of staying at home as much as possible and following hands-face-space when out for an essential reason.""

Oxford-AstraZeneca jab to be tested on children,"A new trial is to test how well the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine works in children.  Some 300 volunteers will take part, with the first vaccinations in the trial taking place later in February. Researchers will assess whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. The vaccine is one of two being used to protect against serious illness and death from Covid in the UK, along with the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. As many as 240 children will receive the vaccine - and the others a control meningitis jab - when the trial gets under way. Volunteers who live near one of the four study sites - the University of Oxford, St George's University Hospital, London, University Hospital Southampton and Bristol Royal Hospital for Children - are being asked to sign up. Those interested in taking part must complete a short questionnaire. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity, and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, noted that most children were relatively unaffected by Covid and were unlikely to become unwell with the virus.  But he said it was important to establish the safety and immune response to the vaccine in children and young people as some children might benefit from vaccination. There are currently no plans for children to be vaccinated with the Oxford-Astrazeneca jab in the UK, as it has only been authorised to prevent Covid in people aged 18 or over.  The Pfizer-BioNTech jab is only authorised in those aged over 16. The vaccine priority list also excludes anyone under the age of 16, even the clinically extremely vulnerable.  Earlier this week England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, told ITV News several trials were under way to develop vaccines that were safe and effective in children, saying it was possible there would be some licensed children's vaccines by the end of the year. The University of Oxford said its was the first trial of a Covid vaccine in the six to 17 age group. It said other trials had begun but only measuring efficacy in those aged 16 and 17. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says there is evidence Covid-19 can cause death and severe illness in children but this is rare. It said: ""In children, the evidence is now clear that Covid-19 is associated with a considerably lower burden of morbidity and mortality compared to that seen in the elderly. ""There is also some evidence that children may be less likely to acquire the infection. The role of children in transmission, once they have acquired the infection, is unclear, although there is no clear evidence that they are any more infectious than adults.""

Twins mark 90th birthdays by moving in together,"Twin sisters are celebrating their 90th birthdays by moving in together for the first time in decades. Pauline Vincent and Jacqueline Hetherington had been living in separate sheltered accommodation in Ashburton, Devon, when they decided it was time to become flatmates. Mrs Hetherington's daughter Jaine Swift said they were inseparable.  ""They really need each other and get very anxious when they are apart,"" she said. ""At this stage of their lives it seems perfect that they move in together.""  Mrs Swift and other family members helped the sisters move on Friday and made them a birthday breakfast of smoked salmon and champagne on Saturday. The sisters, who were born in Halifax, west Yorkshire, in 1931, came to Devon in the 1960s, with Mrs Vincent working as a secretary and Mrs Hetherington raising a family of four children. Mrs Swift said the twins had not lived together since their 20s when her mother married but remained close throughout their adult lives. Asked if the siblings ever fought, Mrs Vincent said they were ""harmonious together"" but Mrs Swift pointed out that her aunt was the tidier - and more bossy - of the pair.

'Plenty of capacity' at Cornwall vaccination hubs,"There are slots available at Cornwall's two largest vaccination centres, a government minister said as he urged anyone aged over 70 who has not yet had the Covid jab to come forward. George Eustice, MP for Camborne and Redruth, said 90% of over-70s had been vaccinated so far. He was speaking as part of a push to meet the vaccination target of 15 million first does by Monday. ""We are doing a big call for those final 10% to come forward,"" he said. The environment secretary said: ""We have made some fantastic progress with the rollout of the vaccine, over 13 million people nationally and about 150,000 in Cornwall."" Mr Eustice, who took a virtual tour of the vaccination hub at Stithians Showground in West Cornwall on Friday, said staff reported a ""tapering off"" of the numbers of people being vaccinated as they got ""towards the end of vaccinating the over-70s"". He said there was ""plenty of capacity"" there and at Cornwall's other major vaccination hub at the Royal Cornwall Showground, near Wadebridge. ""There is a big push in this final weekend and we are asking everybody over 70 who might not have received the vaccine to contact their GP and come forward so that they can receive that vaccination,"" he added. People aged 70 and over in England should contact the NHS to arrange their jab through the online national booking service, by calling 119 or by contacting their GP.

Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu',"Vaccines and treatments could mean that - by the end of the year - Covid-19 is an illness we can live with ""like we do flu"", the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock told the Daily Telegraph he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a ""treatable disease"". The drugs - and vaccines - represent ""our way out to freedom"", he said. However, scientists have warned against treating coronavirus like the flu, as mutations are getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"". Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: ""It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty."" Mr Hancock said he hoped all UK adults could be offered the vaccine ""a bit before"" September. He said new treatments were needed for a ""small number"" who may not be protected by vaccines - a first dose of which has already been given to 14 million people. Antibody treatments are being trialled as an alternative to vaccines for people with impaired immune systems. Mr Hancock said new treatments would play an important role in ""turning Covid from a pandemic that affects all of our lives into another illness that we have to live with, like we do flu. That's where we need to get Covid to over the months to come"". Living with Covid safely would also depend on the vaccines: Mr Hancock's comments suggest he is ruling out a ""zero Covid"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK. Conservative MP David Davis told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""There will come a point where there will be a death rate from Covid but it's at a normal level and then we have to cope with it.  ""Obviously we try to prevent it, but we accept it, I think, we have to."" This is simply about being realistic. Covid isn't something that can be eradicated like smallpox was.  Temporary suppression, which is essentially what countries like New Zealand have done, is about protecting people in the short-term. Unless they keep their borders shut forever, it cannot work long-term. Vaccines mean immunity builds up and at the very least should stop most people falling seriously ill. There will be an ongoing challenge of keeping up with a virus that will mutate - although this is likely to be less difficult than it seems as coronaviruses tend to be much more stable than flu, for which different strains circulate every year. There will always be people who are susceptible, either the vaccine doesn't work or they have refused to have it. That is why the continued advances in treatments are essential. But we should never again see the levels of deaths we have.  Thousands will still die in winters to come. But each year this should lessen until it gets near to the levels of mortality we see with flu - something which society readily accepts. However, scientists have urged caution.  Professor Steven Riley, a member of the Spi-M modelling group, said the rollout of vaccination did not mean coronavirus controls could be dropped, adding that Britain could face a wave as big as the current one if lockdown restrictions were all lifted. ""No vaccine is perfect. We are certainly going to be in the situation where we can allow more infection in the community but there is a limit,"" he told the BBC. ""In the short term, if we were to allow a very large wave of infection, that wave will find all the people who couldn't have the vaccine for very good reason (and) those people who had the vaccine but unfortunately it didn't give them the protection they need."" Dr Pitt added: ""The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous.""  Richard Horton, editor-in-chief of the Lancet medical journal, told the BBC politicians would have to decide what level of deaths would be acceptable if ""zero Covid"" was not possible - adding that, in some years, 30,000 people died from flu. He said the UK was likely to see another spike in Covid-19 cases next winter and suggested it would take two, three or four years to build up sufficient levels of immunity in the population. ""Even if we do have high levels of population immunity, our borders are not going to be secure - and we can't keep locking people up in hotels for the next five years,"" Dr Horton said. Meanwhile, the efficacy of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in children will be tested in a clinical trial, starting this month. Some 300 volunteers between the ages of six and 17 will be involved in the study to assess whether the jab produces a strong immune response in children.

Over-70s urged to get vaccine as UK nears target,"People aged 70 or over who have not yet had a Covid jab are being urged to come forward, in a final push by ministers to meet their vaccination target.  More than 14 million people in the UK have had at least one dose - with the aim being 15 million by Monday. Meanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said the UK could this year live with Covid ""like we do with flu"". ""I hope that Covid-19 will become a treatable disease by the end of the year,"" he told the Daily Telegraph. Over the weekend, ministers are taking part in a renewed drive to encourage people in the top four priority groups - comprising of people aged 70 and over, front-line health and social care workers, care home residents and the clinically extremely vulnerable - to get vaccinated.  Vaccinating the 15 million people in these priority groups would cover 88% of those most at risk of dying from Covid-19. On Friday, Wales said it was the first UK nation to meet the target.  Overall uptake of the vaccine has been high, with a 93% take-up rate among the over-75s in England, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). Across the UK, a quarter of adults have already received one dose, including around nine in 10 over-70s.  People aged 70 or over in England have already been asked to contact the NHS to arrange their jab. They can book an appointment online, or by calling 119 or contacting their local GP.  Health and social care workers should speak to their employer if they have not had their vaccine yet, the DHSC said.  And GP teams have been asked to contact their clinically extremely vulnerable patients to make sure they have been offered a jab. Almost 30 ministers are taking part in visits and virtual meetings across the UK in a further push to encourage everyone eligible for the jab to get vaccinated.  They will hear from NHS staff and volunteers helping with the rollout, as well as people getting the vaccine.  Mr Hancock said: ""I am determined that we protect as many of our country's most vulnerable people from this awful disease as soon as possible."" ""Vaccines are the way out of this pandemic and it is testament to the strength of our Union and the combined power of our United Kingdom that we've seen such incredible progress in the roll-out of our vaccination programme,"" he added.  Prof Stephen Powis, NHS medical director, said the UK's vaccination programme was ""off to a strong start"".  ""People in the priority groups have not missed their chance to get jabbed and if you are aged 70 and over and haven't yet taken up the offer, please do come forward and make an appointment,"" he said. The government has also published a plan to help boost vaccine uptake in all communities, including those who may feel more hesitant about it.  It aims to raise awareness of how the NHS is making vaccination available to all, especially ethnic minorities, homeless people, asylum seekers and those with disabilities. It highlights successful examples of community-led engagement which other areas could replicate, including a mobile vaccination service in Crawley to help reach those who are housebound and the use of social media resources to dispel vaccine myths in Slough.  About two thirds of care home staff have accepted the offer of a vaccine, Professor Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation JCVI, said. He rejected suggestions the jab should be made compulsory for those who wish to carry on working in care homes. ""I would much prefer to be able to persuade by the power of argument than to force people or to make people lose their jobs because they didn't take up the vaccine,"" he told BBC Radio 4 Today. The next wave of vaccinations will include the over-50s and people with underlying health conditions, due to be vaccinated by May, with details to be set out next week. Some regions have already begun inviting the over-60s, who are part of the next phase, to be vaccinated.  On Friday, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed the number of Covid cases was going down in all nations of the UK - although infection levels remained high.  On Friday, 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

Ambulance service trials home Covid testing,"An ambulance service has begun testing patients for Covid-19 at home to reduce delays on arrival at hospital.  South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) says it has launched the trial for all patients aged 18 and over who are being taken to Oxford University Hospitals.  Paramedics are using lateral flow tests, with results given within 30 minutes.  Dr John Black, medical director at SCAS, said the pilot could be expanded to other areas if successful.  He said Covid positive and negative patients were kept apart on admission to hospital so waiting for test results could ""contribute to ambulance handover delays and a bottleneck"". ""This is a small study to begin with in Oxford, so it will not happen with every patient transfer across SCAS,"" Dr Black added.  ""However, further rollout to a wider area will be considered if the concept is proved through the pilot and there is sufficient access to lateral flow devices."" The test involves placing a swab in the nose or mouth which is then mixed with a solution that looks for virus fragments. Droplets are then placed on the device and a result given within 30 minutes.

Why zero Covid may not be possible,"The antibodies that protect against infection with Covid-19 fade over time, so it's likely that vaccination will not provide a permanent defence. Covid could become an illness like flu, says Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary - one that flares up in society at regular intervals, and that people have more than once. Four million people in the UK have now tested positive for Covid and one of the burning questions they are asking is: will they get it again? Some viral infections such as measles, mumps or chickenpox only infect us once. They trigger an immune response that provides a lifetime of antibody protection. Some viruses such as flu are masters of disguise, mutating rapidly to escape the detection from our immune surveillance. Other viruses like the common cold, and other endemic coronaviruses, have forgettable faces that fade from our immune memory and come back to visit us year after year. Just before Christmas I wrote about my surprise at having a possible reinfection with Covid. With 100 million people infected worldwide the number of reinfections appeared to be vanishingly small.  As medical students we immerse ourselves in textbooks full of rare and exotic diseases and in our innocence we then spend our early years diagnosing them in all the patients that we see, only to be gently reminded by our teachers that what is common is common. There is an old medical aphorism for this: when you hear hoofbeats, don't look for zebras. So when I received my positive PCR result, my first instinct was to ignore the zebra and assume that my first positive antibody test, last summer, had found antibodies arising from common seasonal coronaviruses similar to Covid, not from Covid itself. Results from the recent national Siren study have made me rethink. Back at the start of the pandemic Susan Hopkins, an infectious diseases expert, realised that lots of healthcare workers were getting infected, but the lack of testing availability meant that they did not have confirmed PCR (antigen) results. She was being asked about the risk of reinfection and the possibility of issuing ""antibody passports"" that would allow people who had recovered from Covid to carry on their normal lives.  She realised that she didn't have the answers and so did what all good scientists do, set up a research study, which got under way in June. Healthcare workers were among the most at risk during the first wave, so provide a rich soup to study Covid infections. She and her team devised a study of 10,000 NHS staff to follow up for 12 months and as the urgency of the research grew, the study expanded to include 50,000 staff all across the UK.  Those in the study, which is still continuing, get PCR and antibody tests for SARS-CoV-2 every two to four weeks. In the first set of results, published in January, about one-third of them turned out to have antibodies for the virus, confirming previous infection during the first wave of the pandemic, and the remaining two-thirds had remained clear of infection. Susan Hopkins found that almost 1% of staff who had evidence of prior infection became reinfected in just the initial five months of the study. Most of these staff had been asymptomatic in their first infection, and so probably had mild infections with immune responses that that faded quickly, but about 25% had a full Covid syndrome and yet still got reinfected. So the severity of the initial illness did not necessarily protect against subsequent infection. Crucially, the study also highlighted that previous infection did not prevent the risk of future transmission of the virus.  The study also found that some people lose their antibodies really quickly, and others lose them more slowly over time. These results are likely to be a precursor of what happens to our antibodies with vaccines, and so it is becoming clearer that we are unlikely to reach zero Covid. Rather, we will see ongoing outbreaks as our immunity waxes and wanes. One analogy being used foresees the current forest fire of cases becoming a bonfire, then a pile of smouldering embers, and after that just smoke - followed by small fires sparking up, perhaps in the winter months. Previous infection or vaccination will not necessarily protect you. It may become a feature of lives, like seasonal flu. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. This is likely to be an unsettling thought for those who had severe symptoms, for example Jennie Marshall-Hamad, a nurse manager in charge of a female Covid ward. When I last wrote about Jennie, in April, she had sent her four-year-old boy, Zedi, to live with her mother in order to dedicate herself to her work.  A month later she caught the virus. She was unwell for two weeks, and had begun to recover when fatigue and breathing problems set in, keeping her off work for more than three months. She's still attending the long Covid clinic and taking care to get enough rest between shifts. ""I've never been poorly in my life and it's such a big thing that's affected me massively,"" she says. The vaccine provides a degree of confidence. Jennie says she feels safer on the wards, but she remains careful. Like other hospital staff, she takes lateral flow tests twice a week ""to reassure us that we're OK"" and she still only sees her grandparents - who are in their 90s - from the garden. Eighty per cent of the staff on her ward have now had Covid, Jennie says, and they will all by now have had the vaccination too. So how will this combination of immune challenges - infection and vaccination - affect risk of future infection? The Siren study should be able to tell us this, while also showing how single doses of vaccines differ from two doses. It will also be able to investigate the risk of reinfection with new variants such as the Kent variant and help us understand to what extent our immune response to one type of virus protects us against others.  But it seems highly likely that as more variants emerge across the world, the genetic mutations in the virus will make it a moving target for our body's defence system, and for vaccine manufacturers.

Vaccine stockpiling could prolong crisis - experts,"The Covid-19 pandemic is unlikely to end unless poorer countries can access vaccines, scientists writing in medical journal the Lancet have warned. Unprecedented numbers of doses are needed, the article says, but poorer countries lack funds and richer countries have snapped up supplies.  The experts want to see production ramped up and doses priced affordably. It is the latest warning that so-called ""vaccine nationalism"" is putting lives at risk. At last year's UN General Assembly, Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres called the practice - when countries sign deals to inoculate their own populations ahead of others - ""unfair"" and ""self-defeating"". ""None of us is safe until all of us are safe,"" he said.  As well as prolonging the crisis, a lack of availability of vaccines raises the risk of further mutations emerging, according to the Lancet article. ""Unless vaccines are distributed more equitably, it could be years before the coronavirus is brought under control at a global level,"" said lead author Olivier Wouters from the London School of Economics. Several vaccines have been developed in less than a year, something the Lancet article calls an ""extraordinary achievement"". But prices of individual doses vary wildly, with the cheapest costing about $5, the most expensive more than $60. Some can be kept at room temperature, others need special equipment to keep them at low temperature. Deployment is also a challenge - the paper notes that some World Health Organisation members have never carried out a vaccination programme in adults.  And with richer countries buying the bulk of doses - the report estimates these countries have 70% of doses available - the experts warn of a shortfall in poorer and mid-income countries for years to come. ""The world now needs more doses of Covid-19 vaccines than it has done for any other vaccine in history to inoculate enough people for global vaccine immunity,"" it says. As more vaccines are approved, the authors suggest deploying them based on local needs - for instance, single-dose vaccines may be better for poorer countries that lack the cold-supply chains or registries needed for vaccines requiring two doses.

Lockdown diaries: Fighting back with the vaccines,"Doctors go into medicine to help people, but until the vaccine came along, Bristol GP Simon Atkins says he felt ""powerless"" and frustrated watching so many people suffer with Covid-19. This is lockdown life in his own words. ""The arrival of the vaccines has been brilliant for us. For the first time in the whole of the pandemic we are able to do something for people that we know is definitely going to help combat the virus. ""Until this point, if people were sick at home there was little we could do apart from give them advice about managing their symptoms and about when and how to get a test. ""If they were seriously ill and went into hospital, even there, the treatment was largely supportive as there was no specific drug for this virus. ""Finally, since Covid-19 first came along, we can do something, finally we can fight back. ""Because we have the vaccines now, everybody on our staff has a new sense of energy and enthusiasm. ""We've had no end of volunteers from every department in the practice come in on Saturdays to help with the vaccination clinics; be that with administering the jabs themselves, meeting and greeting the patients, or helping run the car park. ""We are always dependent on when the vaccine delivery comes. Two or three weeks back we had two deliveries - one a week after the other - mostly of the Pfizer vaccine. ""The Pfizer vaccine has to be used within three-and-a-half days so if we get a delivery on a Thursday, for example, we and our neighbouring practice open up on a Saturday and blitz it. We text and ring people and invite them down. ""It's about being flexible. On one night recently the nurses were running a clinic and there were two jabs spare so they picked up the phone and called two people on our list and asked if they could get there in half an hour and they did. ""People have also been very keen to get their flu jab - we've had one of the best years ever in terms of take up. People seem understandably keen to get as much protection as possible."" He said up to 1,500 people could be seen at weekend clinics. Dr Atkins said patients and doctors had enjoyed meeting face-to-face again. ""In the first lockdown things changed almost overnight and we were instructed to have remote appointments as much as possible.  ""But I like being a family doctor, and meeting patients in person. That was taken away.  ""I'm looking forward to when things get back to normal, and the vaccine gives us hope that that won't be too far away."" Dr Atkins is a partner at Fishponds Family practice in East Bristol, which has almost 13,000 patients on its books.

The story of NI's vaccine rollout so far,"By Eunan McConvilleBBC News NI Covid-19 vaccinations have now opened up to another group in Northern Ireland - those 80,000 or so people who were in receipt of a shielding letter because they are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV).  The vaccination programme is crucial in the plan to exit lockdown and get on top of the virus.  But how well is it going? Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride has said we need to get between 70% and 80% of Northern Ireland's population vaccinated in order to start lifting restrictions fully.  But how far along that path are we? Well, in short, we still have some distance to go, but to date Northern Ireland's progress has been very good and it even looks to be accelerating. Up until 11 February, 373,414 people had received a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. This is just shy of 20% of Northern Ireland's overall population.  So based on first doses, and Dr McBride's target, we have another 50-60% of the population to get through. It's possible to get a rough idea of when this could happen based on our current rate of vaccination. So let's look at how the rollout of the vaccine programme in NI has been going over the past two weeks. Based on the figures we have, Northern Ireland has been averaging more than 12,500 first doses of a vaccine every day over the past fortnight. That's impressive. It's equivalent to nearly 5% of the population every week - and if we were able to keep up this rate of vaccination, we could hit that 70-80% figure around the middle of May. Now, that projection comes with a few warnings. It's based on the availability of vaccine remaining the same. It presupposes a consistent rate of uptake of the vaccine.  There is also the issue that the rollout will naturally hit peaks and troughs as vaccinators approach the end of a particular eligible group.  And, eventually, more emphasis will have to be put on second doses. That may - or may not - affect the rate of first doses vaccinations between now and May. In short, there are a lot of ifs involved. But while May might seem far off at the minute, it's a feasible target. And one which many other countries would be envious of. Of note is the fact that for the latest two days in which figures have been published, there have been about 20,000 jabs administered per day in Northern Ireland.  This is a very small time window, but it does represent quite the increase in the speed of rollout. Vaccination figures from across the UK show that Northern Ireland is slightly behind the rest of the UK when it comes to the proportion of the population which has received a first dose, but these differences are marginal. Northern Ireland's vaccine programme remains a success story. The story in the Republic of Ireland is a very different one. In terms of first doses, there have been 158,904 given out - meaning about 3.2% of the population has received a jab. While this obviously compares poorly to Northern Ireland, it is the current rate of rollout that is particularly slow. Over the past few weeks, the numbers of people getting a vaccine in the country have been rising, but very slowly indeed. There are some reasons for this.  Ireland has adopted a different strategy than the UK and has not prioritised first doses to the same degree. More than half the people in Ireland who have had a first dose have also received their second dose. Another reason may be the recent row between the EU and AstraZeneca. More than 99% of the doses administered in the Republic of Ireland have been Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines, which require very specific cold storage. Ireland's vaccination rate, however, is one of the better ones in the EU.  Despite such a sluggish start, these rates are expected to speed up substantially in due course. Coupling the vaccination programme with figures on infection rates, the picture is a positive one for Northern Ireland. Statistics from the BBC's Data Unit for the week up until 6 February show falling Covid-19 infection rates across Northern Ireland. This has been an ongoing trend for the past four weeks or so and many of Northern Ireland's council areas have some of the lowest infection rates in the UK. Mid Ulster has the highest infection rate in Northern Ireland at 263 cases per 100,000 population, followed by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon at 250 cases per 100,000 population. Lisburn City and Castlereagh has the lowest infection rate in Northern Ireland at 86 cases per 100,000 population. These falling rates are reinforced by the fact that the R number remains below 1.0. In short, the spread of the virus has been - and continues to be - substantially reduced in Northern Ireland. With more and more people getting vaccinated, and infection rates continuing to be squeezed, the number of people in our hospitals suffering with coronavirus continues to fall steadily. There are now fewer than half the number of Covid inpatients in Northern Ireland than there were a month ago. On 13 January, we had more than 1,000 in hospital with the virus. Now there are fewer than 500. While that is a significant drop, there are still more Covid inpatients right now than at the peak of the first wave last April. Admission rates have been falling as well, meaning that the overall number of Covid patients in our hospitals should continue to fall. Intensive care units (ICUs) have also seen a very slight drop in numbers. But ICUs still remain very busy because of Covid-19 - almost half of patients in intensive care have coronavirus.  In a continuation of the trend for the past four weeks or so, Northern Ireland's Covid death rate is still falling. The seven-day rolling average published by the Department of Health is down to seven expected deaths per day.  Comparing that to the first wave, it gives a good indicator that we've passed through the worst of the current surge. Over the course of the pandemic, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland have had very similar rates of death amongst those who have tested positive for Covid-19. This remains the case.  England, Scotland and Wales have all had much higher equivalent rates of death: Also worthy of note is that two border counties - Monaghan and Cavan - have had the Republic ofI Ireland's highest death rates over the course of the pandemic.  Monaghan's infection rate remains one of the highest in the country, something that is mirrored just across the border in Tyrone and Armagh.  A stern reminder - if one was ever needed - that the virus respects no borders. What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? Is NI in the toughest period of Covid-19 pandemic?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-56048229,1
'Opportunities missed' before prison Covid death,"Opportunities to identify Covid-19 ""were missed"" in the treatment of the first prisoner reported to have died with the virus, a report has concluded. Edwin Hillier, an inmate at HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire, died on 22 March 2020. The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman report said the 84-year-old ""must have contracted Covid-19 at the prison"". The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said it had introduced new measures at the prison since Hillier died. Hillier was reported to have been the first inmate to have died with Covid-19, although it was later found that HMP Peterborough inmate Brett Moore died four days earlier. In 2016, Hillier was sentenced to eight years and six months in prison for child sex offences. That same year he was moved from HMP Bedford to HMP Littlehey - a category C male sex offenders prison. The report said Hillier had several long-term health conditions, including heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and type 2 diabetes. He was sent to hospital with severe breathlessness on 7 February 2020 and returned to HMP Littlehey two weeks later, after having a stent inserted to open up the valves of his heart. On 11 March, he again complained of shortness of breath and was prescribed antibiotics. Five days later, a prison GP noted Hillier should be isolated and monitored for Covid-19. He was not seen again by healthcare staff until 18 March, when he complained of abdominal pain. The next day he was found to be ""shaking vigorously, appeared confused and was grey in colour"" and was taken to hospital where he tested positive for the virus and died on 22 March. The following day, the first national coronavirus lockdown began, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson telling people to stay at home.  The report said Hillier's care in prison was equal to what he would have received in the community and ""of a reasonable standard"".  But it added ""opportunities to identify Covid-19 were missed"" and made two recommendations. It said the governor and head of healthcare ""should ensure that staff recognise the symptoms of Covid-19"" and that healthcare staff should ""monitor prisoners in accordance with clinical instructions"". A spokesperson for the MoJ said it had put the recommendations into place in the prison and staff had been trained on how to spot the symptoms.

Sick of Zoom quizzes? Here are some alternatives,"By Eleanor RoperNewsbeat reporter When Boris Johnson plunged the country into lockdown back in March 2020, the Zoom quiz was born.  Fast forward eleven months and let's face it - we've all had enough. But what else is there to keep us in touch with friends and family, and away from Netflix? From cocktail classes to interactive murder mysteries - lockdown 3.0 has more to offer online.  Unlike this time last year, lockdown birthdays are no longer a novelty. We've all sung Happy Birthday completely out-of-sync on a video call so we're having to be more creative with our  parties. Luckily Shannon's fiance Tom got the memo. Last week was her 26th birthday and he surprised her with a virtual cocktail making party. All she was told was to be dressed and ready by 6pm.  Tom had arranged for a bartender to send ingredients to their home in Bristol in advance and he showed the couple and their friends how to make their favourite drinks. ""Things descended into a 3am Zoom party,"" says Shannon. ""Thank god for good Wifi and porn star martinis - which we can now proudly make ourselves! ""It was so much fun and felt good to get dressed up for the first time in almost a year, even if it was to party at the kitchen table. This is the new 'out out' after all."" It was almost as good as a real night out, ""just without the taxi fare and uncomfortable high heels."" We all need some escapism at the moment. But escape rooms have had to adapt after closing their doors.  This time last year, Ollie was running real life events but shortly after lockdown started, he tells Newsbeat all of his work was cancelled.  Like many businesses, his company Swamp Motel has had to adapt. They're now running immersive experiences for people online. He says it's not an escape room or a murder mystery, but almost like a multi-player video game, where all you need is the internet.  ""We realised we were in the business of entertainment and the social space had become Zoom,"" says Ollie. ""We came up with the idea that you join a call with someone you don't know and they ask you for help in finding a missing person.""  Ollie says we should treat Zoom like a seat in the cinema and base yourself there for whatever experience you're doing - Zoom is just the vehicle to different types of entertainment.  There are lots of companies offering similar experiences, as well as free scripts and storylines out there to spark your imagination. Murder mystery is a popular choice because everyone can be assigned a part in advance and plan their fancy dress.  Some have even gone as far as writing the story themselves. So apart from cobbling your costume together and a maybe a few drinks in your essential shopping, it's a free night in. As well as drinking and playing games, group cooking is also an option. Jess and her friends have tried pizza-making, with everyone having the ingredients delivered and cooking together on Zoom in real time.   ""The lockdown quizzes were great at first but after lockdown one ended, I feel like there was virtual quiz fatigue,"" says Jess. She also tells Newsbeat ""there's only so many walks you can do with a friend."" Pizza night was easy to arrange and Jess says it was fun and creative, without too much screen time.  Some pizza companies will also send the dough and toppings to you and your mates.  ""Obviously we were all on Zoom making pizza at the same time, but we weren't glued to our screens because we were more focused on our cooking.""   If you've completed Netflix and are now dusting off some of the books you've been meaning to read then a book club is a good option.  Grace, who's 26 and from Oxford is part of a Zoom book club.   ""It's definitely less screen time than the Zoom quiz era in lockdown 1.0"", she tells Newsbeat.   ""We take it in turns to choose a book, which means we all read things we wouldn't ordinarily choose.""  Grace says the best thing is the club keep growing and friends of friends are now joining. And while there are plenty of downsides to doing things virtually, it means people can get involved no matter where they are - distance is no obstacle.

The broken bridge that brought a city to a halt,"By Amy WoodfieldBBC News, East Midlands A year ago, before lockdown dawned, Nottingham briefly became one of the most congested places on earth thanks to the closure of Clifton Bridge. One year on, the social media outpouring that greeted another closure of the bridge has an uncomfortably prescient ring to it. ""They can build a 1,000 bed hospital in China in seven days,"" wrote one poster, comparing the rapid construction of a Wuhan hospital at the start of the coronavirus pandemic with Highways England's announcement that it would take a year to repair Clifton Bridge. ""I'm no civil engineer, and maybe there is a really good reason for it taking 11 months. However... the inevitable frustration and criticism is understandable."" Highways England was quick to explain the rationale behind the bridge's closure, which was caused when corrosion to the steel cables that support the bridge was found during a routine inspection. ""It's really important that we don't cause any further damage to the road or the structure in that process and we need to be methodical to avoid more disruptive roadworks in the future,"" Catherine Brookes, regional director, said at the time. However, as the bridge carried up to 60,000 cars every day and was one of just three crossings in Nottingham, its closure sparked a city-wide traffic snarl-up that added hours to commuters' journeys. Weary motorists were left sitting in queues of grinding traffic, spending hours on journeys that usually took minutes and the whole of the city centre became gridlocked. Beth Perry, a scientific officer for a lung cancer research company, said during the first few days of the closure it took her more than four hours to get home from work - a journey that previously took just 15 minutes. She was not alone, with the route's closure making the city the most congested in the world, according to a sat-nav manufacturer. Although one lane was reopened a week later, it was decided the bridge would remain largely closed as a safety precaution while remedial work was carried out. The disruption eased slightly but motorists reacted with horror to the idea the situation could continue for months and some business owners feared for their future. However, as coronavirus swept across the world, their fears were superseded by other disruptions to the city's daily routine. Figures from sat-nav creator TomTom suggest Nottingham's traffic congestion decreased 19% during 2020, as lockdown led to fewer commutes among those who could work from home. Highways England engineers have continued repair work during the pandemic and in November an extra lane was reopened. The continuing repairs would have seemed unthinkable a year ago but have created significantly less disruption than they might have done in normal times. Miss Perry said her journeys between the Boots site in Beeston and her home in Radcliffe-on-Trent are now quicker then ever. ""Now there's hardly any traffic around at all,"" she said. ""Covid has definitely helped in a weird way."" Other commuters like Andrew Woodhouse, an automated software testing engineer, no longer have to travel into the city every day. ""I've been working from home permanently since lockdown last year and so has my wife. So the impact of the bridge repairs is minimal,"" he said. However, he was adamant the bridge repairs remained ""very important"" to allow Nottingham ""to return to normal quicker, whenever that might be"". Highways England said it is using the opportunity of reduced traffic flow to carry out further work on the bridge. The date for the full reopening of the structure has been pushed back from this month to autumn 2021. Ben Smith, who works at a local school, said getting the works completed was ""crucial"". ""Key workers such as myself need to be able to get to work,"" he said. Councillor Adele Williams, from Nottingham City Council, said: ""So much has happened over the past 12 months with the pandemic that perhaps the issues surrounding Clifton Bridge have been forgotten slightly by those not commuting in and out of the city as much. ""This is a Highways England project and we remain in regular contact to seek updates. ""It is disappointing it's taking so long to reopen all lanes and we look forward to this happening... as soon as it is safe to do so."" Adrian Oulds, a regional director at Highways England, said:â¯ ""Workâ¯to strengthen theâ¯southernâ¯endâ¯of theâ¯bridgeâ¯is complete. ""Ourâ¯expertâ¯engineers haveâ¯assessed and designed the repairs needed at the northernâ¯endâ¯of the bridgeâ¯andâ¯we're installingâ¯scaffolding in readiness forâ¯thisâ¯work to start,"" he added. ""Our ambition is to restore the original traffic layout with all lanes back open to drivers as soon as we can.â¯"" The agency added that, once the works were completed, they would not need to return to the bridge ""for some years to come"".

In pictures: What life's like on a UK Covid ward,"By Ben MundyBBC Newsbeat presenter I'm sweating, need a drink and the bridge of my nose is red-raw when I look in the mirror. I've just stepped out of the intensive care ward at Harrogate District Hospital.  I thought I knew what to expect, but nothing prepares you for what it's like on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic. Newsbeat's two-day visit to Harrogate District Hospital coincides with the NHS staff's busiest week since March 2020. As I arrive, they've experienced a difficult 48 hours. The empty bed bays all around us on the ward. A chilling reminder of the impact Covid-19 can have. Walking past some of the hospital's sickest patients is overwhelming and upsetting - it's hard to imagine seeing this day in, day out. While we might not know if the virus is in the supermarket, or the park where we walk - we do know it's in this room. Just think about the impact that, along with seeing these suffering patients, has on the doctors and nurses around us. Yes, they are trained to deal with death, but not on this scale. I found they really wanted to talk to us and share their stories - about the physical and mental drain of working through the pandemic.  And not just those on the intensive care ward, but also the physiotherapists, porters, cleaners - some of the staff keeping this hospital going, but don't always get appreciated by the public. Working front-line in the NHS is largely about providing care (and you see that in every part of the hospital) from the friendly welcome in the PPE department, to the physio holding the hands of a patient as she gets upset.  It's also amazing to see how much the staff care for one another, and support each other through the tough times. Working through this has been a bigger team effort than any of them could've imagined. A huge thank you to the staff and patients at Harrogate District Hospital who shared their stories with us, about what it's like to work on the front line during a pandemic.

Travel rules add to cancer treatment costs,"A woman who has to travel to Germany for brain cancer treatment says new travel rules are adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of her therapy. Natalie Paul, from Bubbenhall in Warwickshire, was diagnosed with an aggressive brain tumour in 2017. When chemotherapy failed, she started a course of treatment in Cologne but faces high costs from new regulations covering both coronavirus and Brexit. The government said it was considering medical exemptions for its Covid rules. The new regulations, introduced this week, say that travellers must take a coronavirus test before leaving the UK and again on days two and eight of quarantine on their return, but they need to pay for these tests themselves. Ms Paul, 30, is too unwell to travel alone and so is accompanied by her parents. She expects tests for all of them will add an extra Â£1,800 to their costs each time they travel - and that's before the bill for the treatment itself. In Germany she receives a dendritic cell vaccine.  Dendritic cells help the immune system recognise and attack abnormal cells and when grown alongside cancer cells in a lab can be used to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer, according to Cancer Research UK. Research is still at an early stage, however, so the treatment is not yet available on the NHS. For each round, Ms Paul will have to pay Â£56,000. Ms Paul has set up a GoFundMe page to help with the costs, but has no idea how many rounds of treatment she will need. ""The extra costs now are starting to erode the stuff we want to gather for the treatment which is ridiculous,"" her mother Liz Paul said. The family have also experienced additional costs relating to Brexit, for example securing green cards so they can drive on the continent. ""We couldn't really have chosen a worse time to be going to Germany for this treatment, but we don't really have the luxury of waiting,"" Mrs Paul said. ""We've got to go for it now while Natalie is fit enough to have the treatment."" The situation has led to calls from The Brain Tumour Charity for the government to at least pay for patients to be tested for Covid-19. ""We're reassured to hear people will received a medical exemption,"" Sarah Lindsell, the charity's chief executive, said.  ""But actually if people are covering the costs of their own treatment surely the NHS should pay for the costs of their tests."" Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

The unfounded claims about vaccines and fertility,"By Rachel SchraerBBC Reality Check Claims on social media that the Covid vaccine could affect female fertility are unfounded, experts have said. Posts have incorrectly suggested the Pfizer vaccine could cause infertility in women, or cause their bodies to attack the placenta.  But there is no ""plausible biological mechanism"" by which the vaccine could affect your fertility, says Prof Lucy Chappell, a professor in obstetrics at King's College London and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The vaccine works by sending a message to the body with a blueprint, allowing it to manufacture a small, harmless fragment of the coronavirus's distinctive ""spike"". This prompts your immune system to kick into action, producing antibodies and white blood cells to fight off the virus - and recognising it if you encounter it again. It can't give you the virus, and it has no way of affecting your own genetic information. These ""messenger particles"" are extremely short-lived: they deliver their message and then they are destroyed. That's why the Pfizer vaccine in particular has to be stored so carefully - the genetic material it contains falls apart and becomes useless very easily.  Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said there was no possible way she could think of that this could have an impact on reproductive health.  Online, some people have pointed to a line in an earlier version of guidance published by the UK government stating it was ""unknown"" whether the Pfizer vaccine had an impact on fertility. This has since been updated to clarify that animal studies don't indicate any harmful effects on the reproductive system.  Part of the confusion here is down to how scientists describe things compared with how most of us would understand them in our daily lives. When scientists say there is ""no evidence"" they mean there hasn't yet been a long-term study on this specific vaccine - but that doesn't mean there are no facts here at all or we're shooting in the dark. In fact, Prof Chappell pointed out, there is lots of evidence from other non-live virus vaccines, including the flu jab, that they have no impact on fertility and are completely safe and recommended for use during pregnancy.  And getting the Covid virus itself - which the vaccine protects against - has the potential to affect fertility, so ""you're much more likely to have fertility issues post-Covid than after the vaccine,"" Prof Stonehouse said. Some of the rumours have suggested the vaccine could threaten fertility because it contains proteins also used to make the placenta. Posts on social media have claimed this could lead the body to attack the placenta.  This is not true - the vaccine does contain a protein which slightly resembles one used in the development of the placenta but it's not similar enough to confuse the body. Vaccines are designed around the most distinctive parts of the virus's spike to make sure it recognises only that.  The fact that the respective proteins bear a passing resemblance ""doesn't mean anything"", says Prof Chappell, since there are lots of similar proteins existing in different places in nature - it's their precise length and sequence that makes them distinctive.  Prof Chappell, who specialises in the health of pregnant women and people hoping to conceive, said she had ""no concerns"" about fertility and the Covid vaccine.  And the deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, when answering questions from BBC viewers, said: ""I have never heard of a vaccine that affects fertility."" He described the suggestion as ""a nasty, pernicious scare story, but that's all it is"". During pregnancy women are understandably very concerned about their health and may be conscious of scandals such as the one surrounding thalidomide - a drug used for morning sickness, that affected thousands of babies, leaving many with impaired limb development. But as a direct result of these experiences, our understanding and treatment of drugs during pregnancy is entirely different.  The advice on treatments during pregnancy is extremely cautious. And pregnant women are generally not included in clinical trials - including those for the Covid vaccine.  Though vaccines are quite different from powerful drugs like thalidomide, most health services are erring on the side of caution. They are generally not recommending pregnant women have the jab unless they are at particular risk from Covid. That might be because they are highly exposed to the virus in their jobs, or at high risk of becoming very sick if they contracted Covid due to health conditions. The UK government says: ""The vaccines have not yet been tested in pregnancy, so until more information is available, those who are pregnant should not routinely have this vaccine.""  Like all things in healthcare, there is an element of balancing risks. Even something as simple as an over-the-counter painkiller carries a tiny risk of ulcers and internal bleeding. But the risk for most people is so small when used correctly, that it is outweighed by the benefits of treating relatively mild pain. And the benefits of preventing an illness that we know can be life-threatening have been judged to be much greater than any theoretical risk of vaccination.

What can families do over the half-term break?,"By Oliver BarnesBBC News A year ago families across the UK were packing suitcases, organising play dates and planning day trips - all in preparation for the February half-term break. But this year's school holidays are set to look very different, with travel and social mixing restricted to stem the spread of Covid-19.  So, as children take a week off from Zoom lessons or socially distanced classrooms, what can parents do to keep the family entertained without burning themselves out? ""Children are going to have to be quite resourceful to keep active during this half-term,"" says former England footballer Rachel Yankey. She has been coaching children remotely as part of the Youth Sport Trust's After School Sport Club, which takes place most weekday evenings. ""If kids don't have an outdoor space, parents might need to make an exception and allow them to dribble a football inside in a controlled way. ""Even half an hour of physical activity makes a big difference to a child's day."" Jason Sugrue, a former British table-tennis champion who works with London-based charity Greenhouse Sports, says children should be ""left to their own devices"" as much as possible. ""Kids are bored of adults telling them what to do by now - so we've been doing a lot of peer-to-peer fitness classes online.  ""Kids will work with their friends to find an object in their house [in a treasure hunt, for example] - it's simple, free and fun."" Greenhouse Sports organised more than 1,500 virtual coaching sessions for children in east London during the first nationwide lockdown.  Under lockdown rules, families can still get out of the house for exercise once a day, provided they remain within their local area. ""It's really important young people make the most of that time outside,"" says Sugrue. ""Nothing beats fresh air."" ""Whether it's a cycle ride, drills or just walking, families must try and find a designated time each day to do an activity together during half-term."" ""It's always said about books that they take you to another place,"" says children's author Michael Rosen. ""It may be to the inside of a mind that's not theirs or a physical place, but that feels especially important for kids during lockdown.""  Rosen says parents must try to make reading ""feel relevant"" to children's interests. ""My trick was always to try and connect books up to theatre, live readings and movies,"" he explains. ""Obviously, we can't do that now but parents must be open to using digital tools to trigger more interest.""  The National Literacy Trust and Oak National Academy are offering online activities and making hundreds of e-books available to children through the virtual school library project.   But Rosen recommends parents let children's reading habits over the holidays ""emerge organically instead of foisting their anxiety about the need to read on [them]"". ""If ever there's a time to relax the rules on screen time, it's this February half-term,"" says child psychologist Laverne Antrobus. ""Especially as it will be the main way for them to stay connected with their friends."" Oxford University research on more than 17,000 teenagers in the US, UK and Ireland showed higher levels of screen time had little discernible effect on their mental health, but many parents are still cautious. ""Screen time doesn't have to be isolating,"" adds Antrobus. ""Choosing a film or a TV show for the family to watch in the evening is something that brings everyone together."" Virtual events are also accessible to families over half-term: the Royal Observatory Greenwich is putting on stargazing workshops and the Shakespeare's Globe festival is offering family tickets for storytelling masterclasses. Antrobus warns it may be ""easier"" for parents to get younger children engaged than teenagers.  ""With teenagers, it's a case of checking in on them and showing interest in the video game they're playing - they love to teach us dinosaurs about tech,"" she explains. ""Arts and crafts is all about making the most of everyday objects - in the house or in nature,"" says illustrator Rob Biddulph, whose online drawing tutorials have become increasingly popular during the pandemic.  ""We've been going out on walks as a family and we'll pick up beautiful leaves, pebbles and sticks. ""And when we get home we'll paint eyes on them and turn them into characters - all that takes is two splodges of white paint."" The Tate Museum and the Southbank Centre also have virtual art events available to children over half-term.  Biddulph says his 11-year-old daughter is less ""receptive"" to drawing and painting than she used to be ""but can still be tempted away from the screen when she sees the rest of the family having fun together"".

The football boss managing from the Covid ward,"Lockdown boredom might have led to a bit of Football Manager in bed, but what about managing a professional team from hospital?  That's what Shrewsbury Town manager Steve Cotterill has been doing as he recovers from Covid. The Shrews boss recently spent time in intensive care, but with his side 1-0 down on Tuesday, a half-time team talk over the phone inspired them to a win.   He'll be managing from hospital once again on Saturday as they play Ipswich. Before the League One side's matches, ""the coaching staff connect him to the Bluetooth speaker and he gives us all his tactics,"" Tuesday's winning goal scorer, 23-year-old Harry Chapman, tells Newsbeat. He only joined Shrewsbury on loan in January and is yet to play a game with Steve Cotterill on the touchline. But the manager's presence is being felt.  ""We came in at one down and he came on the phone and just said: 'look boys don't worry'.""  Harry says the manager even told them he was thinking of changing the formation, but decided against it - telling the players: ""'I think if we can get a goal we can go on and win it'."" Which is exactly what they did.  Twenty-eight-year-old captain Ollie Norburn agrees: ""He just settled us down. His instructions are pretty clear. It's like he's actually in the room."" The players say the boss's ""huge presence"" and ""big aura"" is a big miss. But ""just his voice over a speaker is quite refreshing really"". The manager was only appointed in November 2020. A Covid outbreak in January then closed the club for two weeks with several players having to isolate.  Steve was admitted to hospital after testing positive for coronavirus and then later to intensive care, where he was given oxygen to help him breathe. But his dedication to the club hasn't wavered.  ""His love for the game is unbelievable,"" says captain Ollie. ""He's in hospital but all he can think about is us and winning games."" Despite assistants Aaron Wilbraham and Dave Longwell taking over after Steve was first admitted, ""the detail behind everything"" comes from him.  That includes talking to the players before, during and after games via a Bluetooth speaker - something that midfielder Harry Chapman says gives them an edge. ""You can hear the passion in his voice when he's on the phone. How much it means to him. It gives us an extra edge when we go out like, 'let's do it for the gaffer'."" Ollie also thinks Steve's time in hospital has been a ""gelling period"" for the team.  ""He doesn't want to let us down, so as players we've got to go out there on a Saturday and give everything for him."" But the passion isn't the only thing in Steve's voice.  ""You can hear it,"" says Harry. ""Towards the end he starts getting out of breath."" Ollie says during Steve's team talks they can even ""hear his machine in the hospital"" and it's a reminder for everyone that ""his condition is quite clear"". ""I know it feels like he's a million miles away from everything laying in a hospital bed and he's been there for 40 days. He's obviously putting his body on the line.""

How I bickered and bonded with a Spotify hacker,"By Eloise HorsfieldReporter When my Spotify account was hacked during the current lockdown, I communicated with the unwanted visitor using song and podcast titles. I live alone in Bristol and work from home. One morning, when I hadn't seen anyone except the cat for four full days, I received three emails - each informing me of a ""new login"" to the music-streaming service. The mystery user was apparently in the US. I opened the app on my phone and, sure enough, a song I hadn't selected was playing. It was Come Up by hip-hop/rap artist Kashoutjae - not something I'd choose.  There was obviously someone else logged in. I quickly pressed stop.  Silence. Thinking about it, my Spotify username and password were identical and had been the same since joining the platform back in 2009. So, it's hardly surprising my account was so easy to penetrate. My unwelcome guest persisted, playing Inferno (Mandios), followed by Restful Sounds (Jamson Clark). Each time the music started, I stopped it immediately. But it just kept on coming, with a new song starting up within a few seconds. Next my kitchen was blessed with No Enemies (Port), which begins with a rather ominous-sounding keyboard riff and a stream of profanities. Charming.  This is my Spotify account, I thought.  Irritated, I interrupted my visitor's enjoyment by playing a Lily Allen song I thought would aptly reflect my disgust.  Its title and chorus twists ""thank you"" into an expletive-driven command that is unrepeatable here. ""We hate what you do. And we hate your whole crew. So, please don't stay in touch,"" went one verse, helping communicate my fury. In less than a minute, my hacker had switched the song to a profanity-filled choice of their own. I hit straight back with three choices featuring extreme swear words in their titles, intending to drive home my message. Lovely Choice (Transvestinno), came the reply after a few seconds.  Ah, so my hacker was a human being! Suddenly he or she didn't seem nearly so creepy or weird any more, and I felt us connect. As I said, the last human I'd seen was my boyfriend, but that had been several days earlier. Thank You (Busta Rhymes) I replied, feeling a bit humble. Feelings (CJB) they played in response, and I felt like we were getting on just fine. With a softened heart, I selected Goodbye Stranger (Supertramp) before a finale of Nice Knowing You (Lane 3).  Then I changed my password. But when I logged back in, my ""friend"" was somehow still hanging about, this time enjoying a rather mournful song called Stay Inside (JayJayEnder).  ""Hey, quarantine 2020, are you ready now? I need to go outside,"" the artist said. As I contacted Spotify for help again, I couldn't help noticing its haunting tune and rather relatable lyrics: ""Then this virus started, no-one can go on and live their lives... Coronavirus has taken my summer away."" I felt a pang of sympathy, imagining somebody with no money to spare for a music subscription, just wanting to listen to some songs to pass the time. A helpful Spotify employee was soon on the case. In the next 40 minutes, as we tried to sort it out, my long-distance buddy regaled me with 26 more hip-hop and rock tracks, all of which I stopped almost instantly, out of frustration. I couldn't tell if he or she was antagonising me with titles like Too Close (Mean Mywhyfe), Slaughtered (Unholy Funeral) and Silent Madness (Shooting Tunes). But they all seemed somehow fitting to the situation. Either way, their music taste was now driving me crazy.  The angry lyrics and repetitive drumbeats sounded particularly grating coming through my smartphone speakers. And when a rock track called Crazy Smiles (Visible Invisibles Souls) started up, I cracked and selected Go Away (Weezer).  My hacker replied, Stressed Out (Kashoutjae).  You bet I'm stressed out, I thought!  Work to Do (Average White Band) I told them, followed by a podcast titled Got No Time For This, which was actually in Indonesian - but hey, it's the title that counts.  Heartbreak (Manuel), they replied. I couldn't help but think they were mocking me. Seriously irked, I decided to let them know exactly what I thought of their choices, playing Bad Taste In Music = Low IQ? from the Sound Alchemy podcast. Then I switched to Sorry You're Not a Winner (Enter Shikari). Ha! A passive-aggressive selection of songs by both of us continued for a while, until I tried to call things to a halt by playing the podcast Go For A Walk Outdoors (Finding Better Balance), followed by some ambient music to calm things down. Fan (Crashout) came the response. I guess it worked. In any case, Spotify had finally set me up with a brand new account, so that was the end of the hour-long encounter. I'll never know who the hacker was or what situation they were in. But this brief connection - however unwelcome and anonymous - had provided a brief respite from the solitude of lockdown.  It was a brief interaction with a new person that was neither work-related nor involved a snatched conversation at a shop from behind a mask and Perspex. And now, looking back, I find myself reflecting that this intrusion feels like it was a much less negative experience than it might have done under normal circumstances. âI felt so violated when my Depop was hackedâ Why Spotify wants to monitor your emotions Spotify reveals 2020's most-streamed songs",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56026200,1
Could Wales' lockdown begin lifting by Easter?,"""Cautious"" talks about Wales' tourist industry reopening in time for Easter have started, the first minister said. But Mark Drakeford said the sector - which supports 10% of the Welsh workforce or 120,000 jobs - would not be opened ""in one go"". Although he did not rule it out, Mr Drakeford also suggested it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would be open at the start of April. He said a revised plan out of lockdown would be published ""within days"".  The Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". Mr Drakeford said ministers were talking to the Welsh tourist industry, worth Â£6.3bn to the Welsh economy, ""about what might be possible around the Easter period"". Wales' lockdown is set to be reviewed on 19 February and the first minister said it was all ""very much caveated"" and dependant on Covid infection rates and variants of the virus. Mr Drakeford said if progress against Covid continued, the authorities could ""slowly and cautiously"" lift restrictions in the run-up to spring and Easter ""in all aspects of our lives"". Currently, all indoor and outdoor events are cancelled and visitor attractions, non-essential shops, hospitality businesses and holiday accommodation are shut. Three to seven-year-old children will be able to return to school in Wales from 22 February, along with some older children on vocational courses. The potential phased reopening of schools for the remainder of primary age children and college students will be the priority at the next three-week Covid lockdown review - and Mr Drakeford said there would only be room for some other ""modest"" changes at most. Asked whether the return of more pupils to face-to-face teaching would be his government's priority for the following review on 12 March, the first minister said ""schools will remain our top priority"" if there was ""further headroom available to us"". ""But, of course, there are other things we know that matter a great deal to people and if we were in a position safely to do anything else to lift the restrictions that is what we would do,"" Mr Drakeford added. The first minister said he ""absolutely"" understood the need to give the tourism industry ""some forward notice"" if a partial reopening was allowed for the Easter break. But he said: ""Nobody should think that what we're talking about here is the wholesale reopening of the tourist industry in one go."" Asked if that meant it was unlikely pubs and restaurants would also be open at Easter, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't want to rule things out quite in that way.  ""The way we'll have to do it will be step by step, using what headroom we have, never doing too many things that put us back in danger. ""It will not be safe to lift restrictions over too many things all at once. That means prioritising things."" The first minister said the Welsh Government's ""cautious approach"" would likely focus on the reopening of self-contained holiday accommodation in the first instance. Mr Drakeford saidÂ anyoneÂ booking a holiday should do so ""knowing theÂ uncertain world that we are living in and that there are no guarantees"". The chair of the Wales Tourism Alliance called on the UK and Welsh governments to work together as ""80% of our tourism market is across the border in England"". Andrew Campbell said there was an ""awful lot of planning"" needed before reopening as ""you don't just turn a switch on"". ""There's always been cautious optimism that we could get going again in April, but Easter would be simply wonderful,"" he told BBC Radio Wales ""If we go and open and England are still in lockdown that will cause problems - we need to have those discussions,"" Mr Campbell added. Lynette Esposito, owner of the Elm Tree hotel in Llandudno, said she felt ""optimistic"" after the first minister's comments. But she said coming out of lockdown for Welsh businesses should be ""aligned with England"" as that accounted for ""the bulk of their business"". ""I think in terms of a timeline it is critical we are being given sufficient time, for us to be able to get the place cleaned up and start trade,"" she said. She added she thought it would be useful for hospitality staff to get ""some advantage as to getting a vaccine"" as they would be ""frontline people reopening the economy"". Ms Esposito said they had been seeing a ""substantial number of new inquiries"" from people who had never visited Wales before. ""There is no doubt there is demand out there, but people are still cautious,"" she said. Meanwhile, the Three Cliffs Holiday Park in the Gower has seen a surge in bookings after the first minister's ""positive outlook for this summer"". ""It's lovely to have so much enthusiasm,"" said owner Tom Beynon. Well, a number of figures need to continue fall - namely average case rates, test positivity rates and Covid hospital patient numbers. Wales currently has the lowest Covid-19 infection rate in the UK, with a seven-day average of 102 cases per 100,000 - a dramatic fall from before Christmas, where it had the highest in the UK with 603. The number of hospital patients in Wales was at record levels at the start of January - now it is at its lowest daily average since 20 December. Covid positivity rate in Wales now stands at 8.7% - its lowest point since 8 October. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the proportion of positive tests should be no more than 5% before areas come out of restrictions. The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac) has issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance. In its latest report it said if restrictions were lifted ""too early or too quickly"", there was a ""high likelihood of returning to current levels of infections and hospitalisations in those scenarios"". It said the reproduction (R) number continues to be within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9 - it has been within this range for a few weeks and is down from the period just after Christmas when it was between 0.8 and 1.1. It means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales about seven people would become infected. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, called on the Welsh Government to ""develop a plan for a best-case scenario"". He said: ""As we hit these important vaccination milestones and with the latest review due at the end of next week, it's important ministers now devise a roadmap out of lockdown, providing timescales where possible and appropriate for schools, families, workers and businesses."" Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething said any easing would not happen quickly, adding: ""What we don't want to do is have a rapid opening up and a rapid resurgence of the virus."" On Thursday, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays could go ahead, prompting Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer to urge the UK Government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce a ""gradual and phased"" plan out of lockdown for England on 22 February. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said restrictions will remain for ""at least"" the rest of the month"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules?

'No guidance' for Border Force on hotel quarantine,"Immigration officials have not received guidance on how England's hotel quarantine system will work, less than three days before it is due to launch, a union says.  The Immigration Services Union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers.  From Monday arrivals from 33 countries will have to quarantine in hotels.  The government said staff were supported on how to apply new guidance. A spokeswoman added that Border Force operational guidance was ""constantly updated to reflect the ever changing environment"".  The requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens and UK residents arriving in England from so-called ""red-list"" countries -  including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - which are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants. It will cost Â£1,750 for an individual. From these high-risk countries the government says travellers can arrive in England at five airports - Heathrow, Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough. In Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels. Lucy Moreton, general secretary of the Immigration Services Union, said officers still had questions about what to do with arrivals from ""red-list"" countries and whether they should chase someone if they ran away while being checked.  ""They have had no operational instructions so far at all and we do not know for certain when they will receive them,"" she said. ""We know that passengers will be required to state in their passenger locator form whether they have been in a red-listed country, but the officers have been given no indication about how far they should inquire about the content of the form."" She also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. ""Officers are currently spending 15 to 20 minutes interacting with each passenger. They only have a Perspex screen, no masks or gloves to protect them,"" she said.  ""That's not enough and if that interaction has to be longer there is a concern of an increased risk."" Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said it was not good enough that Border Force staff still did not know how the system would work at airports, including whether high-risk arrivals would be taken straight to hotels or would have to queue with other travellers.  ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be super-spreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" she said.  International travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We are taking decisive action at the borders and every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the Passenger Locator Form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK."" Meanwhile, the website where travellers can book quarantine hotel rooms and new mandatory tests has reopened, after it was hit by technical issues.  The site was taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by Friday afternoon.  It comes as BBC analysis found England's quarantine system might turn out to be less stringent than Australia's scheme, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggests: The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were in line with those in other countries and staff would be able to access regular testing as well as appropriate personal protective equipment. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources have confirmed reports that countries can be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Meanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.  Will you be travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" country?

NI shielders can now book vaccination appointments,"Up to 80,000 NI people who received a shielding letter as they are clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) to Covid-19 can now book a vaccination appointment. Appointments can be made online for vaccinations at seven centres. Online appointments are available for this weekend, with telephone booking available from next week. The news comes as the Department of Health reported another nine coronavirus-related deaths on Friday, bringing its death total to 1,975. There were 407 new cases recorded. There are 488 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland. It comes as the number of Covid-19-related deaths registered fell for a second week, according to Northern Ireland's statistics agency. The virus was listed on the death certificates of 126 people in the week to 5 February.   Health Minister Robin Swann said the vaccination appointment announcement would be ""very welcome to all those who are clinically extremely vulnerable and have been looking forward to getting vaccinated"". ""A start has already been made on the CEV category and offering booked appointments will help to accelerate this,"" he added. ""I would again appeal to everyone to be patient - whether that's waiting on the line to book your vaccination appointment by telephone or waiting your turn in the vaccination programme."" The system will be open to all those who received a shielding letter.   They will have to bring that letter with them to the vaccination centre to prove their eligibility and will receive the Pfizer vaccine. Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme, said people should not panic if they cannot find their shielding letter. ""This is going to be open for a while, there's plenty of appointments. ""For some individuals, they will be called by their GPs, so they may in fact find that their GP is calling them forward - but we're going to issue further advice on this next week.""  Earlier, referring to vaccinations, NI's chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show he was ""confident that we will have completed over-70s and clinically extremely vulnerable through February and perhaps into early March"". About 401,966 vaccines have been administered to date, with 373,414 of them being first doses and the remaining 28,552 being second doses, according to the Department of Health. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland's Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) has recorded a fall of 11 Covid-19-related deaths on the previous week's toll of 137. It is also the second time the number has fallen since the record high of 182 reported on 22 January.  It brings the agency's total of coronavirus-related registered deaths to 2,574.   The Department of Health's total for the same date, based on a positive test result being recorded, was 1,923.   Nisra's figures are higher than that recorded by the department because it records all mentions of the virus on death certificates, even though it may or may not have been confirmed by way of a test. On the agency's measure, there have been 1,676 Covid-19-related deaths in hospital, including the deaths of 224 care home residents.   Taking that figure, and the 737 who died in care homes, it means care home residents now account for fewer than two-fifths (36.8%) of all virus-related deaths.   Virus-related deaths were also recorded in hospices (0.5%) and other residential locations (7.2%).   Deaths in care homes and hospitals involved 174 separate establishments.   People aged 75 and over account for more than three-quarters of all Covid-19-related registered deaths (77.2%) between 19 March 2020 and 5 February 2021.   The Antrim and Newtownabbey (9.9%), and Mid-Ulster (7.7%) local government districts have now recorded higher proportions of all coronavirus-related deaths, compared with their share of all deaths in Northern Ireland (8.3% and 6.4% respectively).    The provisional number of deaths from all causes for the week ending 5 February was 462.   That is 25 more than the previous week, and 125 more than the five-year average for the time of year, which is 337.  On Friday, the Republic of Ireland recorded a further 21 deaths linked to Covid-19, bringing its total to 3,865. There have been 207,720 cases of the virus after the Irish department of health was notified of an additional 921 cases. There are 959 Covid-19 inpatients in the Republic, with 173 in intensive care.

Thousands of city's virus tests yet to be returned,"A third of tests taken in a surge testing programme to detect a variant of Covid-19 have not been returned.  Residents living in 24 Bristol and South Gloucestershire postcodes are ""strongly encouraged"" to get a test. Bristol City and South Gloucestershire Councils said 20,000 tests had been completed since testing started on Sunday and Thursday.  But they ""urged"" people to return another 10,000 outstanding tests.  They would help to ensure the programme gets enough data to learn more about the Kent mutation of the virus, the councils said.  Public Health England (PHE) has said 11 cases found in Bristol were the new Kent variant with the E484K mutation, which has already been seen in the South African and Brazilian variants. The authorities said about 10,800 of the tests in the community surge testing programme have been carried out at mobile testing units. Another 9,200 have been returned to Collect and Drop sites.  But 10,000 home tests have not been returned, meaning half of people who collected one of those have yet to return them to a site.  The tests are for people without symptoms of coronavirus. Anyone with symptoms should still use the government testing service. Christina Gray, Bristol City Council's director of public health, said uptake has been ""very positive"" but that those tests should be returned ""urgently"".  ""This is the only way we can ensure we're getting as much data as possible to learn about the virus and look to reduce local infection rates"", she said.  ""We are looking to provide tests in areas where uptake is low, or access is more difficult, which we hope to roll out next week.  ""Having your tests back will help us understand where we need to focus.""   A list of where tests can be returned is available on the Bristol City Council website.

Pet owner's heartbreak as seven pups 'stolen',"Genna George hoped to sell seven border collie puppies for Â£950 each - but three weeks ago, they were stolen.  Demand for dogs has risen in lockdown and the value of pups like Ms George's has increased by Â£700 inside a year. Police have warned of a spike of animal thefts and the Dog Lost charity said the number of stolen dogs in the UK has nearly tripled in the past 12 months. Now one Welsh police force has taken the step to create a task force after 80 stolen dogs were rescued last month. Dyfed-Powys Police found more than 80 dogs - said to be worth tens of thousands of pounds - thought to have been stolen during raids in Carmarthenshire and Briton Ferry in Neath Port Talbot. Four arrests have been made and 28 have been returned to their owners, with the people bailed as officers investigate. Police are also investigating a number of dog thefts, as well as an incident on the coastal path at Llanelli, where two men threatened an owner with a knife and tried to take his pet ""by force"". Ms George described border collie Catrin as her ""best friend"", who had first litter of four puppies in January 2020, which were given to family and friends.  Catrin had seven more in February this year - but these were taken from the kennel they were in with their mother.

Police 'outnumbered' by hundreds sledging in snow,"Police were left ""outnumbered"" and ""hugely frustrated"" when hundreds of people gathered to sledge in snow. Large crowds congregated to frolic on Newcastle's Town Moor and Flatts Lane Country Park in Middlesbrough on Wednesday and Thursday. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings but the rules do not apply for crowds consisting of individual households. Cleveland Police said it was ""taking up a lot of resources"". ""You can see we're outnumbered,"" said PC Ritchie Robinson. ""If they're not going to engage with us and we can't explain and reason with them in an amicable manner we're going to have to start taking names and addresses and issuing fines."" Police do have powers to disperse crowds and fine or arrest those refusing to leave, but only if they have a justifiable reason such as disorder or crime. Northumbria Police said officers would ""engage with the public where it is proportionate to do so"". A National Police Chiefs Council spokesperson said officers were able to use their discretion but the Home Office determined what sort of crowds were covered by the regulations. The Home Office said people ""should only be leaving home for limited reasons permitted in law and they must follow the rules when they do"". ""The police will continue to take action where necessary, including issuing fixed penalty notices and directing people who are breaching the regulations to return home,"" a spokesperson said. Volunteers who cleaned up litter left behind in Newcastle said Cow Hill was ""an absolute mess"" and warned broken glass had been covered by fresh snow. Northumbria Police said it had dispersed crowds from Town Moor on Thursday night and planned extra patrols to make sure they did not congregate again. The force also said it was aware of footage on social media ""showing a group who appear to be partying on the Town Moor"" on Wednesday evening. ""This type of behaviour is completely unacceptable and undermines the efforts of the majority of people in our region who are making daily sacrifices to prevent the spread of coronavirus,"" a spokesperson said. The gathering was reported to police but when officers arrived the group had dispersed. Health chiefs on Tyneside said large numbers of people socialising in close proximity heightened the risk of transmitting coronavirus and warned an increase in patients attending hospital with sledging injuries was putting extra strain on departments at a ""critical time"". ""Burdening our NHS with avoidable injuries at a time when we are already struggling with a pandemic is not acceptable,"" said Bas Sen, director of emergency care at Newcastle Hospitals Foundation Trust. ""The Royal Victoria Infirmary has seen multiple injuries including some pretty major ones, which are terrible for the people concerned but also start consuming critical resources at a time when things are already stretched.""

Italy's 'Super Mario' answers call of duty,"By Mark LowenBBC Rome correspondent ""The thing about Mario Draghi is that when he ran up the pitch, he would always pass the ball - he was generous like that,"" reflects Staffan de Mistura, a UN diplomat and school friend of Italy's next prime minister.  ""Mario was a team player. Not the best footballer we had but a good one - and he always had a strategy, he knew which way to turn."" Collaboration and a clear sense of direction: exactly the qualities Italy's star economist will need once again as he prepares to lead this country through its deepest economic crisis since World War Two amidst a pandemic that has killed more than 90,000 Italians. It is the culmination of a glittering career for a man whom colleagues and friends describe as ""serious"" and ""reliable"".  Born in 1947 to a well-off Roman family, Mario Draghi came of age early: he was 15 when his father, a manager at the Bank of Italy, died. He lost his mother, a pharmacist, soon after.  ""I remember at 16 when I came back from a holiday on the seaside with a friend,"" he later said, ""and he could do whatever he wanted while I was at home with a pile of letters to attend to and bills to pay.""  But at school, he remained focused and studious. There was little sign of the personal trauma he was facing, says Staffan de Mistura, who most recently served as United Nations Special Envoy for Syria. The Jesuit school they attended instilled in him a sense of social duty, he says: a desire to give back to society, which characterised Mr Draghi's career.  After an economics degree at Rome's La Sapienza University and a PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the young economist taught at universities in Italy before, in 1991, he was appointed director general of the Italian Treasury.   There, among other tasks, he worked on negotiating Italy's membership of the single currency. On the same committee was Yannis Stournaras, who was working on Greece's membership.  ""Mario showed technical expertise - but also flair,"" recalls Mr Stournaras, who became Greek finance minister at the height of the country's debt crisis in 2012 and is now Governor of the Bank of Greece.   ""Our two countries had lots of problems but he was a strong negotiator for Italy and a strong supporter of the European project. It was obvious he would go much further.""  The prediction was right.  After a spell as a vice-chairman at Goldman Sachs, Mario Draghi was appointed governor of the Bank of Italy in 2006, and then in 2011 president of the European Central Bank - where he dealt frequently with Yannis Stournaras. Greece was on the brink of defaulting on its massive bailouts and potentially being forced to leave the eurozone.   ""Mario was not the one in favour of excessive austerity,"" says Mr Stournaras, ""he was more focused on structural reforms. And during the late-night crisis meetings, he kept his very strong sense of humour.""   Some other central bankers and ECB insiders complained of a less-than-collegiate leadership style and tendency to trust just a handful of aides. His habit of disappearing from meetings to take a call or talk to an official made him known as ""Mr Somewhere Else"". In 2012, Mr Draghi gave a speech that changed the course of the crisis, pledging that the European Central Bank would do ""whatever it takes to preserve the euro. And believe me, it will be enough"". That and the policies that followed led to a steady decline in borrowing costs for indebted eurozone members, including Italy, and earned him the nickname ""Super Mario"".  When he left the ECB after eight years, Mr Draghi was asked what his next step would be. ""Ask my wife,"" he replied.  Perhaps not even his wife Serena would have foreseen the crisis that brought down Giuseppe Conte as Italy's prime minister last month - and the choice of her husband to lead Italy's 67th government since World War Two.  ""Naming him was the nuclear option - the last resort since the political parties couldn't find a majority,"" says Enrico Letta, himself Italian prime minister for a year in 2013.  Mario Draghi's focus as prime minister will be on spending more than â¬200bn (Â£175bn) of EU recovery funds - ""the biggest opportunity to transform Italy since the Marshall Plan of the 1950s"", says Mr Letta.  ""It requires all relevant political forces to be on board - and Mario Draghi can unite. He is a technocrat but with a good political nous, strong bipartisan support here and excellent contacts with Brussels and all European circles.""  If there is one person who could potentially bridge Italy's deep political divisions, it is Mario Draghi. ""His special quality is a good combination between speaking and listening,"" says the former prime minister.  ""Many great leaders speak more than they listen. He has the correct balance.""  Mario Draghi is said to keep his wristwatch five minutes early - a stickler for punctuality. He'll have little time to waste to rebuild his country.

France: Previously infected only need one Covid jab,"France's health authority is recommending that anyone previously infected with Covid-19 should only receive one vaccine jab, instead of the normal two doses. People who recover from Covid have some immunity and should be inoculated three-six months afterwards, it said. France is the first country to issue this advice. It has delivered nearly 2.8 million vaccinations so far, the health ministry said. ""The single vaccine dose will thus play the role of a booster"" for someone previously infected with coronavirus, the Haute AutoritÃ© de SantÃ© (HAS) said. The recommendation comes as governments around the world are rushing to vaccinate their populations and try to return life to normal.  At least 3.4 million people in France have had confirmed Covid-19 infections but the true figure is thought to be higher. Around 81,000 people have died -  the seventh-highest figure in the world. France's inoculation programme began in December but is lagging behind that of other countries like Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the UK. The three main vaccines used globally are administered in two doses, delivered several weeks apart. But HAS said that four studies suggest that a single dose in someone who has recovered from coronavirus produces a sufficient immune response to protect against further infection.  ""People who have already been infected retain an immune memory,"" HAS said in a press release. ""The single dose of vaccine will thus act as a booster."" The agency has not said how this recommendation could be acted on or how France would identify who has already contracted Covid-19 and when. People with suppressed immune systems should still receive two doses, the agency added. Vaccines work by mimicking the infection that they are designed to protect against. They teach the body how to recognise and fight the real disease. But it can take time for the immune system to learn this lesson and, often, a booster shot is needed to create a lasting immune memory.  It's reasonable to assume people who have already caught and recovered from coronavirus will have some of this immune memory. Scientists think that memory could, perhaps, be sufficiently reawakened with a single shot of vaccine.  A couple of studies have already looked at this - giving a single dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna mRNA vaccine to people known to have had coronavirus in the past. In both of these studies, the vaccine appeared to work well, prompting their immune systems to quickly make lots of antibodies against the virus.  The large quantities seen suggest their body was already ""primed"" by the natural infection to respond.  More studies are needed to confirm this, but it might be one way to free up extra vaccine doses to share around the world. Confirming which people have definitely had coronavirus takes time and tests, however. Pragmatically, it may still be simpler and faster to give everyone two doses, as already recommended. On Friday French Health Minister Olivier Veran visited the region of Moselle in eastern France where highly-contagious new variants of Covid-19 are spreading. Strains first detected in Brazil and South Africa account for 4% to 5% of all new cases registered in France and can still be contained, he said on Thursday. A mutation first identified in the UK accounts for 25% of new infections. On Friday the chief scientist for the World Health Organization Soumya Swaminathan said there were reports of people being re-infected with new strains. Pharmaceutical companies have said that tweaks to existing vaccines should make the jabs work against mutations of the virus and that booster jabs will probably be necessary in the future.

Coronavirus cases falling in all nations of the UK,"Levels of Covid are going down in all nations of the UK, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.  The data is more evidence lockdown is controlling the virus, even with the more infectious variants circulating - although the health secretary said there is ""still a long way to go"". The latest R number, estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9, also suggests infection numbers are shrinking.  This is the first time since July that R has been this low. It means, on average, every 10 people infected pass it on to between seven and nine other people. Experts warn that infection levels remain high, however.  It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test, according to the latest government figures.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the ONS figures were ""clearly good news"", but pointed out there were still more than 24,000 people in hospital with Covid. He said: ""Everyone can have confidence that the plan is working, that what we're collectively doing is having a positive impact but there's still a long way to go."" It is not clear yet when lockdown will begin to be lifted. Scientists advising government say the lower the cases can get, the better. Unlocking too soon risks another surge of the virus, even though more people are being vaccinated against the disease every day.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he will outline plans for easing any restrictions in the week of 22 February.  Getting schools back will be the immediate priority, the government says. The PM's official spokesman did not rule out the possibility of social distancing being maintained until the autumn, saying: ""The latest data and evidence clearly shows that we remain in a difficult situation with the pressure on the NHS still very significant. ""We will set out a gradual and phased approach towards easing the restrictions in a sustainable way."" The ONS figures, based on tests from people whether or not they had symptoms, suggest: London continues to have the highest proportion of people likely to test positive for coronavirus in any region of England, with around one in 60 estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week up to 6 February. The ONS's data is slightly out of date - covering the week up to 6 February - so may not reflect the situation right now. Senior Statistician Sarah Crofts said:  ""Rates of infection remain high but have continued to decrease in England and across the UK. ""The percentage of positive cases compatible with the new UK variant also continues to decrease in all regions of England except for Yorkshire and The Humber, the East Midlands and the South West where trends remain uncertain."" The evidence is clear - lockdown is having the desired effect of controlling the virus, bringing the number of new infections down.  It is very welcome news, but does it mean we can now safely start to lift some restrictions? Not quite yet, say experts. As one explained, it's a bit like when a relative has been very ill in hospital and you hear that they are getting better - it's wonderful, but it doesn't mean that the ""treatment"" can stop or that things can't take a turn for the worse. There is still plenty of the virus circulating that people could catch.  And although the vaccine rollout is going really well, there are lots of people in the UK who are not yet protected and who could fall serious ill with Covid-19 if they become infected.  Meanwhile, more than 14 million people in the UK have had at least their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.  The government's pledge is to offer a vaccine to around 15 million people in the top four priority groups - which includes people over 70, health and social care workers and people who are extremely clinically vulnerable and shielding - by Monday 15 February.  In a video message, the prime minister said the government appeared to be ""on target"" to meet the pledge - adding the latest figures on vaccinations highlighted an ""incredible national effort"" by NHS staff, Army personnel and volunteers. Wales says it has already achieved this. England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are expected to announce the same soon.  The 14 million figure includes some people outside of these initial groups.  Some regions of the UK have begun inviting groups planned to be reached later in the month, such as the over-60s and people aged 16-64 with underlying health conditions.

Wales 'first in UK to hit February vaccine target',"Wales will be the first UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh Government has said. Within hours, officials say, all over-70s including care home residents, will have been offered a first dose. Wales and the other UK nations have aimed to hit the target by mid-February. First Minister Mark Drakeford thanked ""everyone who had been working around the clock to reach this point"". It follows a warning that vaccine supplies will fall in the coming weeks. The UK Government's Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said Wales' milestone was ""fantastic news"" and testament to the continued effort made by NHS and military staff. The country currently leads the UK in the percentage of the population that has received a first jab - at least 715,944 doses have been given out. Figures up to Thursday night show 22.7% of the population have been vaccinated, compared to 21% in England, 20.4% in Scotland and 19.7% in Northern Ireland. But there were more than 87,000 people from target groups, including more than 37,000 in their early 70s, still to get a first dose. The picture is complicated by a built-in delay on data being published while figures are checked and verified. There are also issues involving some care home residents having to wait for doses, because of isolation due to Covid outbreaks. But Mr Drakeford said he was confident the programme remained on track - with plans remaining in place to reach the next five priority groups by the spring. He said: ""We're the first UK nation to reach this milestone, others will follow in a couple of days."" Asked how many people in those top groups who will not have had vaccine appointments by the weekend, he said it would be ""a very small number"". ""We've already completed 92% of all the people in those priority groups thanks to the amazing efforts of our NHS and other staff,"" he said.  ""There will be some people who were ill when they were offered and need to be re-book. There will be some people who chose not to have a vaccine when they were first offered it, who may have changed their minds."" Mr Drakeford said the NHS was ""checking and rechecking"" whether anyone had been left out and final appointments were being arranged for the weekend. ""Anybody who knows of somebody who may have missed out, it is not too late at all,"" he said. ""We will make sure that those people have an appointment as fast as possible."" Health minister Vaughan Gething said ""a leave no-one behind approach"" was being taken.  ""The next group, those people 65 and over, all health boards are already sending out invites for those people to come forward as well,"" he said.  ""We're not looking to miss a step, we're carrying on with the vaccine we have available."" The top four priority groups include: Figures show 88.4% of those aged 80 or older have had a first dose, compared to 86.3% for 75 to 79 year olds and 79.8% of 70 to 74 year olds. Public Health Wales said a total of 80.3% of care home residents have had a first dose, and 83.5% of care home workers. British Medical Association chairman Dr David Bailey said Wales was ""hopefully on the home straight"". He told BBC Radio Wales: ""People are really making an effort to make the thing go smoothly as possible, and it is a credit to the Welsh public, as well as everyone who has actually been delivering the vaccine, because it has gone smoothly and everyone has been trying to do their part."" Mr Drakeford said: ""To have achieved this first milestone and offered vaccination to everyone in the first four priority groups - those who are most vulnerable to coronavirus - is a truly phenomenal effort.  ""Of course, the hard work has only just begun - there are many, many more people to vaccinate yet and a lot of second doses still to give."" Welsh Conservative's Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies called the milestone a ""true British and Welsh success story"". He said it showed the UK Government had ""ensured Wales has had the vaccines available to protect the most vulnerable in our society and meet this target"" and hoped Wales could soon reopen its economy. However he added there was a still a ""long way to go"" with 80% of the population yet to be offered the vaccine. Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth, said it was thanks to NHS staff and volunteers ""that Wales has been able to accelerate the vaccination effort to its current levels"". Mr ap Iorwerth added his party would continue to call for ""those in all care settings, not just the elderly, to be vaccinated as a matter of priority, and for key workers in schools, the emergency services and public transport to be brought in to the priority system sooner.""

Amazon sues NY amid threat of virus labour lawsuit,"Amazon has sued New York's top prosecutor over her probe of the firm's response to Covid-19 safety concerns, including its firing of workers who spoke out with concerns. The company said Attorney General Letitia James was applying ""an inconsistent and unfair"" standard for workplace safety to Amazon. It asked the court to stop her inquiry. Ms James called the move ""a sad attempt to distract from the facts and shirk accountability"". ""We will not be intimidated by anyone, especially corporate bullies that put profits over the health and safety of working people,"" she said in a statement.  ""We remain undeterred in our efforts to protect workers from exploitation and will continue to review all of our legal options."" Ms James launched her investigation last spring, after a small protest by a group of workers at a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, and the firing of organisers, including Christian Smalls. At the time, she said it had raised concerns about illegal retaliation, noting that the state had codified the right to organise in its law. In its complaint, Amazon said Ms James lacked oversight over the workplace issues, which it said are governed by national labour laws. It also accused her of ignoring the steps the company has taken to protect its workers, pointing to a 30 March city inspection inspection of its warehouse in Staten Island, New York, which concluded that ""there were absolutely no areas of concern"". The rate of infection among Amazon staff in New York is half that of the area's general population, it added. It is unusual for companies to file pre-emptive lawsuits to block potential regulatory actions. But Amazon said Ms James had threatened to sue unless the company met a list of demands, including reducing production speeds, subsidised bus service and reinstating Mr Smalls. ""Amazon cannot accept the OAG's attempt to subject Amazon to an inconsistent and unfair standard for workplace safety that is pre-empted by federal law and assigned to the primary jurisdiction of federal regulators - especially when the underlying facts show that Amazon has done an exemplary job responding to an unprecedented global pandemic,"" the firm said in the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Brooklyn. In the complaint, Amazon, which has a reputation for being aggressive against instances of workplace activism, said that it fired Mr Smalls for violating requests that he quarantine after being exposed to the virus. Mr Smalls has pledged to continue protesting until better protections are in place. In November, he filed a class action lawsuit seeking damages for black and Hispanic workers.

Scotch exports slump to 'lowest in a decade',"Global exports of Scotch whisky slumped to their lowest level in a decade last year, according to an industry body.

In 2020, Scotch whisky exports fell 23% by value to Â£3.8bn.  SWA found the value and volume of exports to most of Scotch whisky's top 10 markets fell as countries went into lockdown to combat the spread of Covid. The closure of hospitality and travel restrictions hit airport retail globally, with export values falling in 70% of Scotch whisky's global markets, compared with 2019.  Scotch whisky's most valuable market, the US, registered the most significant losses as a result of tariffs imposed on single malts by the US in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. In 2020, exports to the US fell by 32% to Â£729m, a loss of Â£340m compared with the previous year. Exports to the EU, the industry's largest regional export market, fell by 15%.   SWA chief executive Karen Betts said: ""These figures are a grim reminder of the challenges faced by distillers over the past year, as exports stalled in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and US tariffs.  ""In effect, the industry lost 10 years of growth in 2020 and it's going to take some time to build back to a position of strength.""  Ms Betts said Scotch whisky was now ""losing considerable ground"" in the US as a result of tariffs imposed there as a result of the EU-US trade dispute. ""The Scotch whisky industry has now paid over half a billion pounds in tariffs - which are a form of tax - on behalf of the UK government because of the subsidies that the government granted to the aerospace sector in breach of World Trade Organisation rules,"" she said.  ""So we are calling on the chancellor to support Scotch whisky distillers by reducing our tax bill in the UK."" The UK government responded by saying it had pushed the issue of tariffs ""incredibly hard"" with the previous US administration, and ""will be engaging the new administration as soon as possible to get these unfair tariffs lifted"". A spokesman said: ""We have a clear strategy in place to de-escalate the dispute and come to a negotiated settlement that works for all parties.  ""Ultimately, we want to draw a line under this so we can move our trading relationship with the US forward and deepen our trading relationship, to the benefit of UK businesses.  ""Our decision to suspend Boeing tariffs helped us swerve additional US tariffs on goods like blended whisky when other European countries were targeted, and has shown the US we are serious about resolving the dispute.  ""We reserve the right to re-impose tariffs if a satisfactory negotiated settlement isn't reached.""  Meanwhile, Pernod Ricard's Scotch whisky business reported ""a measured return"" to its ""pre-pandemic momentum"" in the half-year to December. Chivas Brothers said that although total sales were down by 10% compared with the same period in 2019, they were 17 percentage points up on the previous six months when Covid restrictions first hit. The drinks giant, whose brands include Chivas Regal, Ballantine's, Royal Salute and The Glenlivet, reported 2% growth in worldwide domestic business sales, despite continued on-trade restrictions. Sales were particularly strong in Eastern Europe, which grew by 10%, driven by Russia and Poland.  Double-digit growth was also recorded in China, Taiwan and South Korea where lockdown restrictions have been eased.  North America sales were up by 2%, bolstered by strong sales of The Glenlivet in the US. In the travel retail category, sales slumped by 16%. Chivas Brothers chairman and chief executive Jean-Christophe Coutures said: ""I'm encouraged by how quickly we are rebounding in markets where lockdown restrictions have lifted.  ""Travel retail will continue to be a challenge this year, but our domestic market performance - even in countries with on-trade restrictions - demonstrates the strength of our brands and the versatility of Scotch as a multi-occasion drink. ""We must build on this momentum by clearing the path for Scotch to fully rebound and recover, and that means bringing about a swift end to US tariffs, prioritising Scotch in post-Brexit trade negotiations and a cut in spirits duty in the next budget.""

'Bruising time' for Scottish salmon exporters,"Exports of Scottish salmon fell sharply last year after being hit by the Covid pandemic, according to new figures. HMRC data published by the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation (SSPO) showed they dropped by 23% to 72,155 tonnes. Export sales of whole, fresh salmon were down by Â£168m, at Â£451m. SSPO said the shutdown of food service outlets around the world and greatly restricted air transport hit distant markets the hardest. Scottish salmon sales in China were down 76% by value and 42% lower by value in the US. As sales dropped in the more distant markets, Scotland's salmon producers turned more to Europe.  Exports of Scottish salmon to the EU accounted for 69% of all global sales in volume (50,000 tonnes) and 64% in value (Â£288m), up from 56% and 52% in 2019 respectively. SSPO chief executive Tavish Scott said the figures showed that last year had been ""a bruising time"" for the Scottish salmon sector. He said: ""Our producers have battled really hard to get salmon to their customers around the world, against really strong head winds. ""It is to their credit that they have managed to get so much salmon to their global customers and the switch to EU trade was a good way of offsetting the difficulties experienced elsewhere. ""But now that the UK has left the EU and the full implications of Brexit are clear, our members are suffering from the burden of excessive bureaucracy and red tape which is making it difficult for them to compete in the European market."" Mr Scott's comments came as a new seafood taskforce met for the first time to discuss ongoing post-Brexit problems with exports to the EU. It was set up after seafood firms reported severe disruption caused by new border controls introduced after the end of the UK's transition period. The virtual meeting, which included industry representatives from the catching, processing and exporting sectors, was chaired by Scotland Office minister David Duguid.  Both Scottish Fisheries Secretary Fergus Ewing and his Westminster counterpart George Eustice also attended. The UK government said discussions included the issue of the movement of mixed loads of small consignments, known as groupage, and the ""variation in time taken for loads to be cleared"".  Mr Duguid said after the meeting: ""The spirit of co-operation between all parties was good to see and my officials will now drill down to identify areas for rapid action. ""The next taskforce meeting is in a fortnight but our engagement with industry continues on a daily basis, as does our work to speed world-class Scottish seafood from port to plate as smoothly as possible.""

Family 'devastated' by firefighter's Covid death,"The family of a firefighter who died in hospital with coronavirus said they were ""totally heartbroken and devastated"". Daniel Granger, 52, was an on-call firefighter for Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service for nearly 22 years. He was based at Cottenham and was described as ""the life and soul of the station"". ""There are no words that can describe how much we will miss him,"" said his family in a statement. Mr Granger died on Thursday ""after losing a four-week battle with Covid-19"", the fire service said. His mother Margaret, sister Katie and brother-in-law Mel said: ""Daniel had the biggest heart and would do anything for his family and friends. ""He would light up any room. He was incredibly funny and had the most amazing personality."" Watch commander Julian Bridgerman said Mr Granger was a ""massive influence"" at the station and had ""spent his life helping others"". ""I cannot put into words how much he will be missed by us all; he wasn't just a colleague for 22 years, he was also a great friend,"" he said. Chris Strickland, chief fire officer of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""Our thoughts remain with Danny's family at this incredibly difficult time.

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  We've had some good news this afternoon - levels of coronavirus are going down in all four nations of the UK. It's evidence that lockdown is having the desired effect, even with the more infectious variant. But experts warn that infection levels remain high. Meanwhile the R number - the average number of people that one infected person will pass the virus onto - is at its lowest level since July. Estimates put it at between 0.7 and 0.9, meaning the epidemic is shrinking. Wales will be the first UK nation to have offered the top four priority groups a Covid jab, the Welsh government has said. Officials say that within hours, all over-70s including care home residents will have been offered a first dose. The UK government set a target of Monday to offer jabs to the top four groups - about 15 million people - and currently, more than 14 million have been vaccinated. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford also prompted hope for an easing of lockdown rules in the country, saying ""cautious"" talks about the tourism sector being able to reopen in time for Easter have begun. Read the latest here. Police in Middlesbrough say they were left ""outnumbered"" when hundreds of people gathered to sledge in the snow. Covid regulations allow police to issue fines for organised gatherings - but the rules do not apply for crowds made up of individual households. Insp Tony Cross from Cleveland Police said: ""It's taking up a lot of resources"" and if people didn't engage ""we're going to have to start taking names and addresses and issuing fines"". Read more here. The deadline to buy a home under the current Help to Buy scheme in England has been extended. The scheme applies to new-build homes but Covid has caused long delays to construction and, if the properties are not built in time, buyers face losing thousands of pounds. The government has now extended the scheme until the end of May, but some buyers are worried that the two-month extended deadline will still come too soon.

Hotel quarantine less strict than Australia's,"England's hotel quarantine system could be less stringent than Australia's scheme, a BBC analysis has found. A copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators, ahead of the launch on Monday, showed rules were looser in several key areas.  In England, the rules allow guests time outside with security staff, seen in Australia as putting workers at risk. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". Updated guidance for hotels will be released ""imminently"", the Department of Health and Social Care said. Meanwhile, Labour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said she understood Border Force still had not been given operational guidance on how the hotel quarantine system would work from Monday.  Home Office minister Victoria Atkins told the BBC those arriving from ""red list"" countries - deemed high-risk due to new virus variants - would face strict measures even before they departed for the UK. The requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from such countries, including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa, and will cost Â£1,750 for an individual.  In Scotland, all those arriving internationally by air will have to isolate in hotels.  International travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. It comes as Home Secretary Priti Patel urged people to ""persevere"" with England's booking website, where travellers secure rooms and new mandatory tests, after it was hit by technical issues.  The site was taken offline minutes after it launched on Thursday but appeared to be working again by 15:00 GMT on Friday following maintenance work.  However, the government's advice page on hotel quarantine did not include a link directing passengers where to book and instead asked people to check back later to make a booking.  Ms Cooper said it ""isn't good enough"" that Border Force staff still do not know how the system will work at airports, including whether they will be asked to check for high-risk arrivals and if those passengers will be taken straight to hotels or will have to queue with other travellers.  ""Chaotic long queues with no social distancing in place have the potential to be superspreading events that will undermine the very measures being introduced,"" the Labour MP said.  BBC science editor David Shukman found the rules in England would be looser than Australia's system, which is seen as among the best in the world. A copy of the guidance for hotels in England's system suggested: The UK government said staff would be able to access regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. In England travellers will only be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise.  There had been conflicting messages about the policy, with No 10 and the Department of Health forced to issue several clarifications. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. Asked about differences between England and Australia's systems, Ms Atkins said standards in England ""are amongst the strongest in the world"".  Scotland's national clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said hotels there would ""allow people to behave like human beings"" by going outside for fresh air. But one Australian epidemiologist described allowing travellers quarantining in hotels to leave their rooms for fresh air as ""very risky"". Prof Michael Toole said there was evidence of transmission when guests opened doors, and ""with the positive pressure this kind of fog of virus went out into the corridor, travelled down and infected hotel staff"". Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, said governments had a duty to provide people working in the hotels with ""the highest possible protection from infection"".  It comes as the Australian state of Victoria enters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. The UK has secured an initial 4,600 rooms across 16 hotels for its quarantine system.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said that, at present, around 1,300 people per week arrive in the UK from red list countries, with this number expected to fall. The new system also introduces tougher penalties, with avoiding quarantine in a designated hotel attracting a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in on arrival risks up to 10 years in prison. All international arrivals must book and pay in advance for two additional tests during their quarantine period, or face fines up to Â£2,000. In a further development, government sources confirmed reports that countries could be added to the red list with just a few hours' notice. Rather than previous weekly reviews of travel corridor arrangements, there will now be a ""fast track"" system allowing ministers to quickly curb travel from virus hotspots. It comes as 15,144 new cases were recorded in the UK, as well as 758 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.  Meanwhile, more than 14 million people have had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to the latest government figures.  Will you be travelling to the UK from a ""red list"" country?

Has the UK economy been hit harder than other countries?,"By Anthony Reuben and Nicholas BarrettBBC Reality Check The UK's GDP, which is the value of everything produced in the economy, was 9.9% down in 2020 compared with 2019. There is no question that it has been a bad year for the UK economy, with severe restrictions imposed for a lot of the year as a result of coronavirus. It is also an economy reliant on consumer spending on things like hotels, restaurants and leisure activities, which have been badly hit by lockdowns.  But has the UK economy had a worse year than those in other advanced countries?  In an interview on Friday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak told BBC News: ""We calculate GDP in a different way to pretty much everybody else."" He added that if you corrected for that difference: ""What you find is that our performance is very much in line and comparable to other countries and, in fact, it may be on a margin better than places like Canada, Germany, Italy and Spain."" Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds told BBC News: ""The UK has had the worst economic crisis of any major economy."" Spain, which is not in the G7 group of major advanced economies, registered a fall of 11%, so the UK economy certainly performed better than that.  The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which works out UK GDP, published a blog explaining the differences in methodology. The tricky part is how you work out the output of public services such as healthcare or education. If you want to know the output of a normal business, you just look at how much it has made from selling its goods or services. That doesn't work as well with the public sector, so the ONS bases its figure on measures such as how many people have seen a GP, how many operations have taken place and the number of pupils receiving education. Things like the closure of schools and the cancellation of non-urgent operations meant that the output of public services took a big hit in the pandemic. Other countries tend to base their figures either on how much money has been spent on public services or how many hours have been worked by staff delivering them. As the amount of money spent has not fallen, that method would show less of a drop in their output. That is also how the ONS works out GDP in nominal or cash terms. ""Where the public services element is based on the money spent, the fall in UK GDP is broadly comparable to other G7 countries, and smaller than falls seen in Canada, Italy and Germany,"" it said. ""However, the 'real' estimates better reflect changes in the services being delivered."" The real estimate is the one that takes into account changes in prices, which the nominal one doesn't. The ONS also looked at a measure of GDP excluding public services, which it said made little difference to the UK (which was factoring in a decline in public services already), but made Germany's figure worse by two percentage points. However, it added that: ""In this approach the fall in UK GDP is still one of the largest in the G7."" Others have argued that while the distinction the chancellor mentioned may reduce the perceived fall in public sector output, it doesn't measure the drop in consumer spending or investment, both of which suffered from steep declines. ""It is clear that the decline in GDP was significantly bigger in the UK than in Germany last year,"" said Andrew Kennington, from Capital Economics. The UK economy fared badly last year. Adjusting for differences in methodology improves that performance, but it still leaves the UK towards the bottom of the league for economic performance. Prof Diane Coyle, from University of Cambridge, told Reality Check: ""This does show the limitations of GDP as a measure of economic wellbeing in any meaningful sense. ""It isn't a great framework for measuring any output outside the market, be that public services or environmental impacts.""  What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Covid vaccine plan causing 'fear and confusion',"A father whose son has learning disabilities says waiting to find out when he can be vaccinated against Covid-19 is ""frightening"". Mark Blaker, from Wiveliscombe in Somerset, says it is unclear when his 28 year-old son Joe will be eligible for a jab.  Figures published this week show disabled people are more likely to die from the virus than their peers. The government says it is working hard to vaccinate everyone at risk. Disabled charity Mencap said research published just before Christmas showed adults with learning disabilities were six times more likely to die from Covid-19. For people aged 18 to 34 with learning disabilities the figure jumped to 30 times more likely. Mr Blaker said: ""It's a very frightening time when you hear those sorts of stats."" He said people with disabilities and those looking after them felt like ""little islands"" in their own homes because of lockdown. ""There is a sense that we've been forgotten, that the sort of person we are talking who is a very caring, loving person who brings a lot of joy into other peoples' lives and does a lot for other people is not valued. ""That's really wrong and needs to be challenged."" Mencap executive director Jackie O'Sullivan said adults with Down's syndrome were included in category four of the Covid-19 vaccination schedule - along with 70 year-olds. Category six of the vaccination programme includes adults aged 16 to 65 years-old in an at risk group, including people with ""severe and profound"" learning disabilities. ""The problem there is there is no definition of what 'severe and profound' means,"" said Mrs O'Sullivan. ""You can imagine if you're in your 20s or 30s you're 30 times more likely to die than your peers but you're having to wait in line with them to get the vaccine - that could be months."" The Department of Health and Social Care said it is working hard to vaccinate all those at risk. ""At the moment people with severe and profound learning disabilities fall into the 'adults at risk' group,"" a spokesman said. ""There is good evidence that certain underlying health conditions increase the risk of morbidity and mortality from Covid-19 and therefore individuals with underlying health conditions have been prioritised for a Covid-19 vaccination in phase one.""

What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme?,"The European Union has been criticised for the slow pace of coronavirus vaccinations in member states.  It has introduced export controls on vaccines produced in the EU after its rollout was hit by supply problems and delays. The scheme, set up in June 2020, allows the EU to negotiate the purchase of vaccines on behalf of its member states. It says this can help reduce costs and avoid competition between them.  Member states do not have to join the scheme, but all 27 EU countries chose to do so.  They are still allowed to make separate deals with vaccine makers with which the EU does not have an agreement. Hungary has agreed to buy two million doses of the Russian Sputnik-V vaccine. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was approved for use in the EU on 29 January.  The EU signed a deal for 300 million doses in August, while the UK ordered 100 million doses and signed its deal in May. But AstraZeneca has had supply problems, which it blamed on manufacturing issues at one plant in Belgium and another in the Netherlands. Reports suggested deliveries to the EU would be reduced to 31 million - a cut of 60% - in the first quarter of 2021. This prompted criticism from the EU which says it should not receive fewer doses just because the UK signed a contract earlier. It said AstraZeneca's UK plants ""had to deliver"". AstraZeneca said the fact that EU contracts were signed later left less time to resolve problems in the EU supply chain. It said its agreement with the EU allowed the option of supplying Europe from UK sites, but only once the UK had sufficient supplies. ""As soon as we can, we'll help the EU,"" chief executive Pascal Soriot said. UK government minister Michael Gove said there would be ""no interruption"" to UK supplies, which had been ""planned, paid for and scheduled"".  The EU announced on 29 January that it was introducing  export controls on vaccines made in the bloc.  It said this would also apply to vaccines moving between the Republic of Ireland (which is in the EU) and Northern Ireland, overriding part of the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. After widespread criticism, the EU reversed this decision. The EU previously placed export controls on personal protective equipment, to make sure member states had enough.  The EU approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in December, having signed a deal for 300 million doses. But the company was unable to supply the 12.5 million doses it had promised by the end of 2020.  Vaccinations in parts of Europe were paused after it temporarily cut deliveries, to increase capacity at its processing plant in Belgium.  The head of BioNTech, UÄur Åahin, said ""the process in Europe certainly didn't proceed as quickly and straightforwardly as with other countries"".  The EU has doubled its order of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to 600m doses and the French company Sanofi will help manufacture 125 million doses of the vaccine, starting this summer. The EU approved the Moderna jab in January but ran into problems here too, with Italy and France both announcing a reduction in supplies. More then 18 and a half million doses of the vaccine - a mixture of first and second doses - have been given to people living in the EU, which has a population of 448 million.  In Germany, where 3.8 million doses had been administered by 11 February, the government has been criticised for lagging behind other countries, despite BioNTech being a German company. By the same date, 2.4 million jabs had been given in France, 2.2 in Spain and 2.8 million in Italy. The government says the UK - by contrast - has given more than 14.5 million doses up to 11 February. The European Commission says it has reached agreements with three other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials: The Commission concluded initial talks with two other companies, Novavax, for up to 200 million doses and Valneva, for up to 60 million doses. A European Commission spokesperson told BBC News the strategy of ordering vaccines from several suppliers was ""fundamentally sound"" and would ""ensure almost two billion doses for European citizens"". But on 10 February, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen acknowledged the EU's vaccine rollout failures, saying: ""We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time.""  After the UK approved the Pfizer vaccine in November (nearly three weeks before the EU regulators), some argued that it was only able to move this quickly because of Brexit.   Reality Check looked into this claim and found that the UK's approval of the jab was actually permitted under EU law - a point made by the head of the UK medicines regulator. The government said that being outside the EU did allow it to be more nimble in this area. So, what about the EU vaccine scheme? The UK could have joined it last year, while it was still in a transition phase with the EU (and following its rules), but it chose not to.  If it had, the UK might not have been able to do as many deals with vaccine companies. The terms of the EU scheme state that participating countries must, ""agree not to launch their own procedures for advance purchase of [a] vaccine with the same manufacturers"", that the EU has an agreement with.  The Commission is required to notify these countries of any agreement it is about to conclude and they have five working days to opt-out if they don't agree with the terms of the deal. The Commission confirmed that no country has used the opt-out so far.  However, the German government - a participant - signed its own side deal with Pfizer for 30 million extra doses in September.  In January, the European Commission refused to say whether this had broken the terms of the EU scheme.

Jersey pubs and restaurants to reopen on 22 Feb,"Pubs and restaurants in Jersey will be allowed to reopen for table service only from 22 February, the government has announced. Up to 10 people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of people from different households. Customers must have a substantial meal and a social distance of 2m (6ft) must be kept between tables. Further relaxations to Covid restrictions will begin next week, the government said. From next Wednesday, faith groups will be allowed to meet for worship in groups of up to 40 people. Controlled outdoor sports gatherings can also restart from Wednesday for up to 35 people under 18 and from 8 March for up to 35 people over 18. From 22 February, any pubs that cannot serve food must remain closed, the government said. Last orders at those that can reopen must be placed by 22:00 GMT and masks must be worn at all times except when eating and drinking. Rules on household gatherings will remain unchanged, with islanders banned from mixing with others in their homes. Chief minister, Senator John Le FondrÃ©, said the current levels of infection in the island showed it was safe to continue reopening group activities ""carefully and with mitigation measures in place"". He said: ""Risks remain though, which is why we are not opening up too quickly and why we are not yet relaxing our travel arrivals policy.""  The minister for health and social services, Deputy Richard Renouf, said the relaxation of public heath measures created some risk but there were ""significant wellbeing benefits to reconnecting some of the activities we have all been missing"".

How England's hotel quarantine will differ from Australia's,"By David ShukmanScience editor England's rules on quarantine hotels for travellers arriving from Covid ""red list"" countries are less stringent than those enforced in Australia.  The BBC has seen a copy of the government's official requirements for hotel operators ahead of the policy starting on Monday. It spells out the rules for handling travellers for 11 nights of quarantine. The UK government said its hotel quarantine measures were ""in line with those in other countries"". And it promised to update guidance for hotels ""imminently"". Australia's system, introduced early last year, is seen as among the best internationally. But as a result of repeated outbreaks among staff and guests, and the arrival of new variants, the rules in Australia have been tightened and are under review again.   It comes as the Australian state of Victoria enters a five-day ""circuit breaker"" lockdown in a bid to suppress an outbreak linked to its hotel quarantine system. UK Home Office minister Victoria Atkins said the system being introduced was ""very strong"" and its ""standards are amongst the strongest in the world"".  ""We keep these measures under review,"" she added. In Australia, people staying in quarantine hotels are not allowed to leave their rooms.  This follows incidents in the early months of the pandemic when security guards and hotel guests were seen to mingle, and were blamed for spreading the virus.  One of these outbreaks led to a surge in cases that forced Melbourne into a five-month lockdown.   However the authorities in England have issued a conflicting array of messages about policy on this, with No 10 and the Department of Health and Social Care forced to issue several clarifications. The upshot is that travellers will be allowed out of their rooms for a limited set of exemptions, including exercise. Smoking, which at one stage had been described as a legitimate reason for going outside, will not qualify. In New Zealand, smoking breaks are allowed, under escort, but with strict guidance not to get close to anyone else. Policy on this changed in Australia after the risks of meal service became apparent. A woman from Singapore who tested negative during most of her stay became infected with the same variant of coronavirus found in a family of five from Nigeria in the room opposite. There's no definitive explanation for how she caught the virus but one suggestion is that the doors of both rooms were opened at the same time to collect meals.  Officials say the viral load in the air in the family's room - with all five of them being infected - could have meant that the virus was carried through the air across the corridor. It's one reason why hotel staff now deliver meals at staggered times to avoid everyone opening their doors at the same time.  The UK guidance states that room service will be ""undertaken in full compliance of Covid-19 prevention best practice"".  The government said meals would be served three times per day, but did not comment on specific timings. There is growing evidence of the risks of the virus being transmitted through the air either between rooms or between rooms and public areas such as corridors. A security guard who spent the day on duty in a corridor caught the virus despite having no contact with anyone.  A widely-held assumption is that infectious aerosols had accumulated in the air in this poorly-ventilated space and had led to his infection. In the state of Victoria, hotel staff now have to be equipped with a type of mask known as an N95, roughly equivalent to what is called an FFP2 in the UK.  By contrast, the document issued to UK hotels spells out that standard surgical masks must be worn - these are thinner and are thought to be less effective at blocking aerosols. It also says that if emergency maintenance is needed before a room has been disinfected and left vacant for 72 hours, staff should wear PPE that is ""consistent with droplet precautions"". Droplets are produced by coughs and heavy exhalations and are generally judged to be a risk over a distance of up to two metres. There is no specific guidance on the protection needed to guard against aerosols that can linger in the air.  Prof Nancy Baxter, of the University of Melbourne, is among scientists pushing for hotel staff to be better equipped. ""I truly believe that if you're putting workers in harm's way, which essentially you are, by putting them in a quarantine hotel, and exposing them to people potentially with Covid-19, that there's a duty of care that those people have the highest possible protection from infection."" Following infections among hotel staff in Australia, and amid fears of the new variants, all employees are tested for coronavirus every day. That includes days off, with a requirement that staff are paid for those days.  However, the UK document does not suggest any provision for regular testing. England's Department of Health said plans for a ""bespoke service"" for staff testing were being developed but it could not confirm whether it would be ready for the start of the policy on Monday.  The government added that all staff working in England's quarantine hotels would be provided with regular testing and appropriate personal protective equipment. A government spokesperson said: ""We have taken decisive action at the border and every essential check from pre-departure testing, to the passenger locator form and the suspension of travel routes strengthens our borders and prevents the spread coronavirus into the UK."" Ministers have said they have ""shared expertise"" with the Australian government about quarantine, but questions will be raised about whether the lessons learned are being followed.

All dental students forced to repeat a year,"All dental students in Scotland will have to repeat a year after their training was disrupted by Covid. Scotland's dental schools said students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she understood how disappointing it would be for students across the country. She said the Scottish government was determined to support students and was providing extra bursary payments. The bursaries will be the equivalent of a student loan award which could be up to Â£6,750, she said. Mrs Freeman said the decision to make the students repeat a year was a ""tough one"". ""It is about giving dental students the experience that has been denied them this year because of the pandemic,"" she said. ""We need to ensure that people studying dentistry can enter the profession as confident fully-qualified clinicians."" Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow Dental Schools have all taken the decision to defer graduations. They said the students had not been able to gain sufficient clinical experience of aerosol generating procedures (AGPs), which can result in droplets being thrown into the air, creating the potential for Covid-19 to spread. AGPs, involving the use of high-speed instruments, represent the majority of dental treatments. Graduation for students at Dundee and Glasgow Dental Schools will be deferred until summer 2022 with all current year groups repeating the 2020-21 academic year.   Graduation for students in the final year at Aberdeen will be deferred until Christmas 2021 and all other students will repeat the 2020-21 academic year. Prof Phil Taylor, who is dean of the faculty of dental surgery at the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, said he understood and supported the decision taken by Aberdeen, Dundee and Glasgow dental schools. He said: ""Patient safety is always at the forefront of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh's actions and this decision supports our efforts in this respect. ""Dentistry as a profession has been uniquely disadvantaged throughout the pandemic in comparison to other primary care services due to the lack of meaningful support made available for the sector, and this is one of the many resulting knock-on effects. ""I sincerely hope dental students are able to obtain a high standard of practical training and experience as part of their studies over the course of the coming academic year, which will benefit the dental profession as a whole going forward."" Student leaders also welcomed the bursaries but asked for clarity from the Scottish government to ensure all students could benefit from support. Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said: ""The marketisation of universities means many students have to pay astronomical fees to access education, it is only right these dentistry students should be given full compensation."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""It is a big blow to people who would have been in their final year and who had been hoping to get into employment very soon. ""It just shows that we need to look at the impact this is having on the younger generation - those at school, college, university and those who are about to graduate. ""They are going to be the generation that is really going to feel the effects of this for some time.""  The Scottish government said aerosol procedures were common in dentistry placements but unusual in other clinical settings such as medicine, nursing and midwifery. Students on those courses will not be required to repeat a year and any extensions to their programmes will be covered by other arrangements.

Hotel quarantine rules still being finalised,"Details of the new managed quarantine rules for people arriving in Scotland are still being finalised, Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has said. The new regime, under which travellers will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, comes into effect on Monday. Ms Freeman said discussions were continuing on the rules, but pledged they would be ""finalised in time"". There has been a disagreement between the Scottish and UK governments over how the system will operate. Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight will be subject to the new quarantine rules, but in England they will only apply to people travelling from 33 ""red list"" countries. This has raised questions about what will happen if people travel to Scotland via hubs in England. Ms Freeman said the Scottish government was ""very clear"" that no-one who has travelled internationally should enter Scotland without being part of managed quarantine. She told the daily coronavirus briefing that this was ""driven by clinical advice, and it's driven by our experience last year and over the summer and subsequently.  ""We are very determined as far as we can to ensure that that view is followed."" But the UK government's Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme on Thursday that passengers arriving in England from ""low risk"" countries would be required to quarantine at home - even if their home was in Scotland - rather than face hotel quarantine at their point of entry. Ms Freeman said that this approach was ""insufficient"", and that the Scottish government was trying to persuade the UK government to ""adopt a tougher approach"". ""While we do that, we do have to give serious thought to options,"" she said, because ""many will enter the UK via major airport hubs... and will then travel to Scotland.   ""We need to work through with the UK government how that will be managed."" Ms Freeman said the question of whether measures were needed at the border between Scotland and England was ""an operational issue for our chief constable"".  A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""We have maximised our visibility in communities and on roads across Scotland, including the border area, to provide reassurance, deter anyone who might be considering breaching coronavirus regulations and, where necessary, enforce the law. ""At this time there are no plans to establish road checks anywhere across Scotland simply to enforce coronavirus regulations."" The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said the operational process for managed quarantine was ""being worked out even as we speak"".  ""We have done this very, very quickly and it will be in place on Monday,"" he added.  ""The operational delivery of what exactly [managed quarantine] will look like - how your meals will be delivered, and what the breaks from the room will look like - that is what we're still looking at."" Ms Freeman also said the list of those who would be exempt was ""being reviewed as we speak"".  ""Where there are changes to that, those will be announced very shortly - there are some instances where people should be exempt from managed quarantine.""    And she added: ""The rules will be finalised in time. I can't be clearer than that I'm afraid because the discussions are really important discussions and they need to work their way through - but everyone is very conscious of Monday's date... and are working very hard to make sure the rules are finalised in time, not only in time for Monday but in time for people to know and understand them.""  Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said he was concerned that the drip, drip of information without giving solid answers ""spreads fear and uncertainty"". He said people in border areas were ""really worried"" about whether they would be able to cross the border to go to work or a doctor's appointment. ""There's lots of issues that are being raised at a local level,"" he said. And he added: ""I just want the two governments to work together. I think there is a route we can take for the two governments to share advice, to negotiate with each other and come to a reasonable conclusion. ""Let's just get around the table and sort it out rather than one side or another saying the other side is not speaking to them or not doing enough."" Jeane Freeman also gave the latest vaccination and coronavirus case figures.  She said 67 deaths of people with Covid-19 and 830 positive tests had been recorded in the past 24 hours. It brings the death total under the daily measure to 6,666. Ms Freeman added that 1,113,628 people had received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine as of Friday morning. This is 64,881 more than the previous day's figure - another new daily record. Scottish government figures also showed that it had met its target number of vaccinations for older adults living in care homes.

Guernsey vaccine gap increased by four weeks,"The gap between the first and second dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine will be increased from six weeks to 10 for people in Guernsey. It means anyone who has an appointment to receive their second dose of the vaccine will need to reschedule. The States said lengthening the gap between doses provided more protection. President of health and social care, Deputy Al Brouard, said the evidence behind the decision was clear. ""New scientific evidence has emerged in respect of how we can ensure that the vaccines administered are as effective as possible,"" he said. ""Significantly, there is now clear evidence that by leaving a longer gap between doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, the second dose is more effective, providing more protection to the individual."" In the UK, both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines are being given 12 weeks apart.  In Guernsey the increased gap only applies to the Oxford vaccine and the States said anyone in the 70-79 age bracket who had been booked in for a vaccine would be written to.

Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales,"As Wales' coronavirus death toll passes 5,000 people, we are sharing some of your tributes to those who have died with Covid-19 during the pandemic.  Cheryl Saunders, from Abercarn in Caerphilly county, spent her whole 40-year career working in the NHS as a medical secretary in respiratory medicine, first of all in Caerphilly Miners' Hospital and later at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr in nearby Ystrad Mynach.  She still worked in respiratory medicine at the start of the pandemic, but was forced to stop working in the summer after being diagnosed with advanced metastatic renal - or kidney - cancer.  The mother-of-two and grandmother to twin three-year-old girls tested positive for coronavirus while in hospital and died, where she worked, at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr, on 27 October 2020, at the age of 62.  Her desk at the hospital remains empty, where a candle burns in her memory.  Tommy Owen, from Pontardawe in Neath Port Talbot, worked as a bricklayer for the local authority from his teens until his retirement at the age of 63.  The eldest of five, Tommy fell ill in early April after catching the virus.  He was taken to Singleton Hospital in Swansea, where his family were unable to see him, before he died, aged 76, on 11 April.  He is survived by his son and two of his siblings. Married couple Sharon and Malcolm Bamford died within days of each other on the same intensive care unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea.  Sharon worked at the hospital as a health care assistant at Singleton Hospital in Swansea for ""many years"", and in the haematology and oncology ward since 2005. She died on 21 April 2020 at the age of 63, just a few days after her husband Malcolm.  At the time of her death, the health board said the mother-of-two was ""highly thought of by all patients"" and ""loved by her colleagues and friends within the team"".  Like so many in Wales, coal merchant John Williams was affectionately known across his local community by his job title.  ""John the Coal"", from Merthyr Tydfil, died at Prince Charles Hospital in his hometown on 25 November after contracting Covid-19.  John was married for 52 years.  Rosalind Cadwallader spent the majority of her career working as an ""exceptional"" cook at the brickworks in Buttington, Powys, where her husband was the manager.  After the works closed and her husband died, in 1999, Rosalind moved to Welshpool, before spending the final few years of her life at the Rhyallt Nursing Home in the town after the onset of Alzheimer's disease.  A ""very generous lady who is greatly missed,"" Rosalind had three children, seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. She died at her nursing home at the age of 88 on 24 April last year.  Cyril Barton, from Cardiff, died on 7 January 2021, aged 95, at University Hospital of Wales after contracting coronavirus shortly before Christmas.  Cyril served as a bomb aimer and bomber navigator in the RAF during World War Two, before playing a handful of matches in defence for Cardiff City after the end of the war.  He later worked for an advertising agency for more than 30 years.  Cyril was born in Grangetown, before moving to the Whitchurch area of Cardiff in 1955, when he bought his first and only house.  He was married to his wife Norma for 71 years and had two children and four grandchildren.  He is pictured on his 90th birthday having flown a Tiger Moth plane, 72 years after learning to do so in South Africa during the war.  Beverley Ford, from Ferndale in Rhondda Cynon Taf, was a healthcare support worker with the learning disability service for 36 years.  She began working at Hensol Hospital in 1984, before moving to Brynafon Learning Disability Unit in Ferndale in 2003.  Colleagues of the 55-year-old said she was ""always going above and beyond"".  She died in December after contracting coronavirus.  Gillian Dare, from Caerphilly, was a care home manager, working as across several homes for Caerphilly council until her retirement 11 years ago.  She died on 30 December at Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil at the age of 71. Her grandson said she was a ""caring person who was larger than life,"" who spent ""all the time she could with family"".  Retired electrician Keith Board, from Cardiff, died with coronavirus just a few months after his 80th birthday.  Keith was married for more than 55 years to his wife Bernice and had three children and four grandchildren.  His family described him as a ""social person"" who ""truly loved living and energised the room he was in with happiness"".  Keith died at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff on 8 October.  For one family, who all lived in the same block of flats in Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taf, coronavirus was especially devastating.  Gladys Lewis, 74, and her sons Dean, 44, and Darren, 42, each died within five days of each other last autumn after contracting the virus.  Dean's widow, Claire, told the BBC after their deaths that David Lewis was ""broken"" after losing his wife and two children.  A joint funeral was held for the family, in order to allow them to be together, while mourners clapped the coffins on the way to church.  Staff nurse Terry Andrews worked in hospital in Denbigh throughout his career.  Terry died on 15 April last year at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighshire, at the age of 75.  He was married to his wife for 54 years and had two children, and his family said he would ""always be our hero"".  Margaret Thomas was inspired to be a nurse by her Auntie Mary, a midwife, before spending a career caring for people across Swansea.  After being trained at the nursing school in Craig y Nos, Powys, Margaret then worked at Swansea General Hospital in the casualty unit, before moving to Singleton Hospital and latterly Morriston Hospital, where she was promoted to sister.  She died at Morriston Hospital on 11 April last year after falling ill with coronavirus.

Andrew Woolhouse worked as a porter at Llandough Hospital in Cardiff.  He became the sixth member of staff working for the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board to die with the virus earlier this month, at the age of 55.  The health board's chief executive, Len Richards, said after his death that Andrew ""often went the extra mile for our patients will be missed profoundly by everyone at Cardiff and Vale UHB"". John Whitfield was born in Dorrington, Lincolnshire, in 1942, and lived there, in Yorkshire and in Buenos Aires before moving to Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, at the age of 12.  In Penarth, he met his wife Sandra, who he married in 1968 and with whom he had three daughters.  John became a teacher at St Cyres school in the town, where he was a French teacher and later head of modern languages, speaking French, Spanish, Latin and Greek.  His family said his four grandchildren ""adored him as the most boisterous adult they knew, but at the same time a model of patience and care"".  John died at University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, aged 78, on 19 December.  Father-of-two Alan Ward, 82, was ""one of the kindest people you could meet,"" his daughter said.

His two daughters, Gemma and Leanne, were at his side when he took his final breath Gemma Emmanuel, his daughter, said: ""My Dad was the kindest man you will ever meet, and was so generous. He was known by everyone for his generosity. He did not deserve to die so young and be taken from his family."" More than Â£3,000 was raised to have a memorial bench to Stephen placed in Blaenrhondda. The bench is currently being made.  Valerie ""Val"" Jones, spent most of her life living in Treherbert, Rhondda Cynon Taf.  She had three sons - Martin, Wayne and Layton - who she mostly raised alone while working in pubs in the town, as well as singing in clubs alongside the likes of Dorothy Squires.

Device aids 'virtual' treatment of Covid patients,"A hospital is using so-called ""virtual wards"" to treat coronavirus patients and ease pressure on beds. University Hospitals of Leicester Trust said a small blood oxygen monitor meant it had treated 130 people at home. Patients take their own readings and are checked daily over the phone by a specially-trained nursing team. Andy Darcy, who fell ill in December and spent a night in hospital before moving on to the virtual system, said it was ""really beneficial"". Patients are initially assessed by Glenfield Hospital's clinical decisions unit to see if their symptoms meet the criteria for virtual treatment. Those who are willing and deemed suitable are then sent home with an oximeter which gives instant oxygen saturation readings - one of the key indicators of a Covid positive patient's condition.Â  The trust said the ""ward"", which can contain between 20 and 30 patients, was first set up in October. Respiratory consultant Dr Daniela Cristea-Nicoara said: ""Coming into hospital at the moment is something patients want to avoid.  ""A ward this size in hospital would require a high number of staff members but this can be managed daily by just five specialist nurses."" Dr Cristea-Nicoara said the system offered ""high-quality"" care, even if a patient's condition deteriorated. ""Based on the daily assessments we can make a decision on whether the patient needs to come back to hospital or whether they need more advanced treatment like being put on oxygen,"" she said.  Mr Darcy, from Elmesthorpe in Leicestershire, first went to hospital on 14 December with chest pains and was diagnosed with coronavirus. He said: ""I was kept in overnight and then kept on a ward all day the next day. ""I was then discharged later that evening with an oxygen meter, a thermometer and some paperwork to tell me all about the virtual ward."" During his daily calls with a nurse he was asked about his symptoms, temperatures, oxygen levels and was guided through some breathing exercises. His oxygen levels dropped to a worrying level and he was asked to return to hospital where he was diagnosed with pneumonia. He was there for three days before being discharged back to the virtual hospital ward with a care plan. He said: ""It was really beneficial, not just from my point of view but for the hospital as well, because you could see they were really stretched. ""It meant I felt more comfortable and probably helped my recovery a little bit as well."" Dr Cristea-Nicoara said patient feedback gave 90% satisfaction for the system and a second ""virtual"" Covid ward had just been set up.

Travel banned at some Austrian and Czech borders,"Germany is to ban travel across some of its borders, after the interior ministry said Austria's Tyrol region and the Czech Republic were now classed as coronavirus ""mutation areas"". Austrian police and soldiers were deployed in Tyrol on Friday to restrict travel outside the region. The Czech Republic has also banned movement in and out of three regions. In a blow to the government, Czech MPs refused to extend a state of emergency, even though infections have not fallen. The German border restrictions with Tyrol and the Czech Republic will come into force on Sunday. ""They are unavoidable for a certain period of time to prevent the spread of dangerous virus variants,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn announced. A travel ban will also come into effect with Slovakia. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said the German government had been asked to impose temporary restrictions by the states of Saxony in the east and Bavaria in the south-west. Checkpoints will be put in place and trade links will be allowed to continue. Further exemptions will be announced later, which are seen as vital for commuters. Germany imposed border controls for three months at the start of the pandemic in an attempt to halt the spread, but it affected cross-border workers and families as well as trade. The infection rate has come down in Germany in recent weeks and the head of the RKI public health institute, Lothar Wieler, said on Friday that the ""corona measures are working"", adding that they had also helped prevent the usual wave of winter flu. A national lockdown has been extended until 7 March, but schools in some states will reopen this month and hairdressers can start work again on 1 March. Across the Austrian border in Tyrol, health officials are facing an outbreak of almost 300 cases of the South African variant that Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has described as ""the biggest currently known of in the European Union"". Police and soldiers are out in force on Tyrol's domestic and foreign borders, checking people leaving the province for negative coronavirus test results.  Checks are taking place on motorways and smaller roads, as well as on trains and at Innsbruck Airport. Anyone leaving the province, including commuters, are required to show a test that is no older than 48 hours.  There are exceptions for children, members of the emergency services and people transiting the province without stopping.  The measures do not apply to East Tyrol, which is geographically separate from the rest of the province. The Austrian government has opted against placing the whole of Tyrol under quarantine, a decision that has been criticised by opposition politicians and virologists.  Czech health authorities reported another 8,916 cases on Friday, after parliament rejected a government move to extend the state of emergency, which ends at midnight on Sunday. The government's ban on movement affects three areas where infections are especially high: Cheb and Sokolov along the German border as well as the Trutnov district on the Polish border. What is not clear is what will happen to the restrictions on Monday, when the state of emergency ends. The night-time curfew and limits on the freedom of movement and gatherings will end automatically, BBC Prague correspondent Rob Cameron reports. Ski-lift operators have already said they will fully open from Monday and most shops are likely to open too, but schools, pubs and restaurants are set to remain shut under public health legislation, our correspondent adds.

£10m funding package for arts and creative sector,"The Department for Communities has announced Â£10m of funding for the arts and creative sector. Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey said the money will help stabilise the sector which has been ""disproportionately impacted"" by the pandemic.  She said the financial support was also vital to preventing the closure of many organisations. It will benefit 168 arts and cultural organisations across NI.

‘It’s on you’ if you don’t get vaccinated – Tory MP,"By Adam FlemingBBC News Political Correspondent People who refuse the coronavirus vaccine should not feature in the government's calculations about lifting restrictions, according to the leader of a group of Conservative MPs who are campaigning for an early end to the lockdown in England.  Mark Harper, who chairs the Covid Recovery group of backbench Tories, told the BBC's Newscast podcast that the rest of the population should not be held back by those who choose not to get a jab. ""You can't say 'I'm not going to take the vaccine, but I need everybody else to change their lives to protect me,'"" he said. ""I'm afraid that risk you run - it's on you. It's not on everybody else."" He said take-up of the vaccine had been high so far and the injections should not be mandatory.  The former Home Office minister made the comments after the government confirmed earlier this week that two million people in the priority groups for vaccination in England had not come forward or had not been reached.  The number of people unprotected had to be taken into account when planning policies, according to Professor Adam Finn, who advises the government as a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation.  ""Moves towards lifting restrictions will depend on levels of population immunity to the variants of the virus circulating at the time,"" he said.  ""This will be influenced by multiple factors including the proportion of people who have received vaccine and the duration of protection following vaccination or infection. ""It's a complex evaluation and we are all in this together.""  About 70 Conservative MPs belong to Mr Harper's Covid Recovery group, which is enough to defeat the government on a vote in Parliament if the opposition also opposes the motion.  He called for all coronavirus-related legal restrictions on activities to be repealed and replaced with non-binding advice once the most vulnerable groups in the population had been vaccinated, which the government aims to do by the end of April. ""At that point, I don't think you can justify legal restrictions at all,"" he told Newscast.  The Coronavirus Recovery Group will seek to influence ministers next week, as they study data on the impact of the vaccination programme on transmission of the virus around the country. ahead of the prime minister' announcement of plans to gradually lift lockdown.

Police 'furious' over Covid vaccination snub,"A police federation has claimed officers are ""furious"" with the government for ""failing"" to prioritise them for Covid vaccinations. Zoe Wakefield, chair of the Hampshire Police Federation, said her colleagues were ""being spat at, bitten and contracting the virus"" on the job.  She said officers need the jab ""so they can continue to protect the public"".  The government praised the ""tireless efforts"" of police but said vulnerable groups would be vaccinated first. The first phase of vaccinations aims to offer jabs to people aged over 50, care workers, the clinically extremely vulnerable and those with underlying health conditions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said police officers should be considered by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for the second phase.  However, Ms Wakefield said the government was ""blatantly ignoring"" the need for police to receive jabs and released an officer's ""emotional"" letter addressed to the prime minister and health secretary.  She added: ""Police officers are, quite rightly, furious at the government for failing to prioritise them in the vaccination schedule."" The officer's letter, written anonymously, said he lives with his asthmatic mother and questioned why she should be put at risk because of his job.  He said he had been coughed at while on duty and was ""offended"" by the way the government had treated officers during the pandemic. ""The notion that we as police officers are not important enough to receive vaccination in some sort of priority is preposterous,"" he added. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are following advice from the independent JCVI to vaccinate the most vulnerable people in cohorts 1-4 first.  ""They advised the immediate priority should be to prevent deaths and protect health and care staff, with old age deemed the single biggest factor determining mortality.""

Should I worry about my child's development in lockdown?,"By Paul KerleyBBC News For children under the age of five, Covid restrictions have been in place for a big chunk of their lives. For the very youngest, daily life has never been Covid-free. What should parents and carers of young children be concerned about? Five experts offer advice and support.  For most families with a new baby, there's no need to worry, Alison Morton, of the Institute of Health Visiting, says. ""In those first few months, parents are babies' most favourite things,"" she says. ""Sitting on your lap, taking turns, mimicking - they're very happy with just that."" Sally Hogg, from the Parent-Infant Foundation, which supports teams working with new parents, agrees.  ""You don't go to a parent-and-baby group with a three-month-old because baby needs to learn to sing,"" she says. ""It's because you need the company and positive baby-friendly ideas. ""To get those things in lockdown, you might chat on the phone with friends, family and other parents or join groups online."" As older babies become more aware of the world around them, Alison says, they remember someone or something exists, such as a parent, even when they can't see them.  ""As a result, babies experience separation anxiety and may get upset if they're left with unfamiliar people.  ""This is totally normal and nothing to do with any lack of socialisation because of Covid."" Once they're more inquisitive and confident, toddlers want to play with other youngsters. ""If your child has no older siblings, then clearly - because of Covid - those contacts will be restricted,"" Alison says.  ""But studies of children with restricted play - like those in hospital long-term - found youngsters adapted and found other ways to play."" Most children should recover long-term, even though the pandemic has changed play, she says. And if you're a single parent, or know one, you can always ""bubble"" with them. Use your daily home routine to help your child develop. Learning through play ""Be imaginative,"" paediatric registrar Dr Rakhee Shah, at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, says. ""Make laundry-folding into a game ""Get them to pick out specific colours or items.  ""Young children love to copy and mimic family life."" Through domestic role-play children learn to: And play has become Covid-related, Alison says, ""doing handwashing and putting face masks on Teddy"". Everyday routine  Have a regular snack time, walk time and reading time, Alison says. ""People worry about children looking at screens too much,"" Dr Bernadka Dubicka, who chairs the child-and-adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, says.  ""But they've been lockdown lifesavers.""  There should be balance, though. ""Have meals together, make eye contact and keep screens out of bedrooms,"" Bernadka says. But how do you persuade two-year-olds to engage in a Zoom conversation with Grandma and Grandad? ""Young children will chat for a bit, then just wander off,"" Sally says.  ""But you can share stories and play games. ""Get grandparents to ask them to find things, a certain toy or something that's a specific colour."" Get outside All our experts spoke of the value of going out to play.  Parks and playgrounds remain open.  England's current lockdown restrictions allow under-fives to go with you when you meet someone you don't live with for exercise.  In Wales, children aged 10 or below can accompany you.  And in Scotland, the age limit is 11. Rules by nation: Nurseries also remain open.  Although, in Scotland only key-worker children can attend. ""Sending a child to nursery must be a parent's individual decision,"" Dr Paul Ramchandani, Lego professor of play in education, development and learning, at Cambridge University, says. ""I'd say it depends on local Covid levels and how comfortable you feel.""   Watch out for persistent changes in their behaviour. For example, if they: ""Stress in very young children can often present with physical symptoms,"" Bernadka says.  ""They'll describe stomach pains, because they don't have the verbal skills to express themselves accurately."" Health-visitor appointments were cut when the pandemic started. And many became online only. Health-visiting services have now restarted. But in practice, Alison says, there are huge local variations.  ""There's particular worry for small premature babies and for others where conditions like cerebral palsy have been missed,"" she says.  ""It's been up to parents to acknowledge problems.  ""Many have been anxious about asking for help."" If you're concerned about your child, contact your GP, midwife or health visitor. Parents are anxious, Alison says.  ""But it's important to know most children are going to be fine,"" she says. ""And you can ask for help if you're worried."" Paul agrees.  ""It's normal to feel extra stressed,"" he says. ""Family life has adapted. ""But chances are you're still being a good-enough parent."" Watch your mental health Parent and child mental-health problems go hand-in-hand, Bernadka says.  ""If more adults are struggling, then it's not going to have a positive impact on children,"" she says. And those parents need to find help for themselves first. Signs you might be struggling include: In a recent survey of pregnancy and young children's providers, by the First 1001 Days Movement, nearly all (98%) said parental anxiety or depression had affected babies.  Don't catastrophise ""Not everyone needs to be labelled with a mental-health problem,"" Alison says.  ""Parents often just lack confidence."" ""I've worked with hundreds of new mums who've had a wobble and needed ideas or a bit of extra support.  ""Everything's soon back to normal."" Don't be afraid to ask Speak to your partner, family or friends first if you can. But professional advice is available. Health visitors would rather hear from people early, Alison says, before more serious conditions, such as anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder and post-natal depression, develop. In an Ofsted survey of 208 nurseries in England, most reported children returning after the spring 2020 lockdown had fallen behind in personal, social and emotional development.  Some returned less confident, while others were using nappies and dummies at an older age than nursery staff would expect. But Paul offers words of reassurance.  ""There are very few developmental goals which most children won't be able to catch up with,"" he says. Vulnerable children Our experts agree youngsters with special needs or living in poverty or homes where there's conflict or abuse could have longer-term issues and need more support. In the first lockdown, babies and toddlers from disadvantaged backgrounds, according to university researchers in Oxford, missed out on activities to support their development, compared with those with more highly educated and well paid parents. The government says 4.2 million children were living in poverty in 2020.  But it's ""committed to making sure every child gets the best start in life"" and has targeted support by: ""We know the biggest driver for mental-health problems is poverty,"" Bernadka says.  ""But for all children, one of the most important things that parents can do is just to be there for their child.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-55936928,1
Café ordered to close for breaching Covid rules,"A cafÃ© which repeatedly failed to observe Covid safety rules has been ordered to shut for three months. The closure order has been made against Kate and Luc CafÃ© and Restaurant in Burnage by Manchester magistrates. Manchester City Council said it and police had received frequent complaints about the owners' failure to enforce social distancing rules, with staff not always wearing face masks. The cafÃ© cannot reopen until 9 May and its owners must pay costs of Â£3,586.52. A council spokesman said the cafÃ©, in Burnage Lane, was first warned in November about the lack of face coverings. Last month it was issued with an improvement notice after complaints from the public that staff were still not wearing them. Food was still being served to customers inside, rather than being offered only for takeaway as the law currently allows. No efforts to enforce social distancing were being made either. The owners also failed to install protective plastic screens to create a barrier between staff and customers. Further advice was ignored, leading to fines and a warning that it could be forced to close. On Sunday, police dispersed a ""sizeable group of customers"" from the cafÃ© after reports of disorder. Council and police applied for a three-month closure notice because of the ""excessive disruption"" caused by the cafÃ© remaining open, the abuse aimed at council staff and police and the clear threat to public health posed by the owners' actions.  Lucjan Domanski and Katarzyan Korzewnikow Domanska did not attend the magistrates' hearing on Wednesday. Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar said: ""The behaviour of the owners of this cafÃ© has gone so far beyond what is acceptable the closure of this premises was the only route left open for us. ""Hundreds of other businesses have adapted and put in place procedures to keep their customers safe but the same cannot be said for Kate and Luc's.""

'We got engaged after 24 hours',"When Wales was locked down to try to stop the spread of coronavirus, comedian Lorna Prichard thought it would put a halt to her planned return to the world of dating. But the film fan went online, found her hero and fell in love. Here she describes how she found her happy ending. I'd always been into romantic movies. And deep down I'd harboured hope that my own love life would be as full of passion and emotion as the ones I had seen on screen.  From Casablanca to Clueless - I was hooked on love stories from a very young age.  But throughout my 20s and early 30s, my love life had been a series of disasters. Box office bombs.  I spent a couple of years in the dating wasteland. And in March 2019 I decided to give myself a year off. Instead, I'd focus on my career in stand-up comedy. March 2020 would be the perfect time to get back on the dating scene.  When that month finally came round, I realised to my dismay that a global plague had accompanied it. Dating was completely off the cards! Not just a ban on casual sex, there was a ban on meeting up for coffee! Not that I could afford luxuries like coffee - suddenly, all my gigs had dried up.  With characteristic optimism I decided to take my love life online. After all, I had plenty of time on my hands! I joined a couple of dating apps and set up my profile: ""Tree-loving Welsh woman seeks same"", ""Jobless comedian after an audience of one"".  I also went for a range of photos that showed what fun I was and how flat my stomach had been 10 years ago. I hadn't anticipated the amount of admin online dating involves! It didn't help that I'm bisexual, so that was double the paperwork. By May I was ready to give up. I thought I'd have one more trawl through my dating inboxes out of politeness.  That's when a man called Leo caught my eye. He was a Brazilian engineer. He had lively, intelligent eyes and a big smile. I decided to give virtual dating one last chance and invited him for a Friday night drink over Zoom.  He was an hour late, which surprised me. How can you be an hour late in lockdown? What other commitments can you possibly have? But he soon made up for it with easy conversation and natural charm.  A non-stop stream of texts and phone calls ensued between us. Were we falling in love, or just bored? I'm not sure we'll ever know. The prospect of holidays to his hometown of Rio de Janeiro may have helped.  The only hiccup we encountered was when he, a meat-loving Brazilian, discovered I was vegan.  Eventually he got over it, and we set our sights on a real life date. Covid restrictions meant we'd have to keep two metres apart, but at least we'd be able to chat without worrying about the wi-fi going down.  I was excited but also very nervous. He seemed perfect on paper and over the internet, but what about in real life? I drove to Bristol in my best outfit - a long, over-sized summer dress that concealed the fact I hadn't exercised or shaved my legs in four months.  Towards me wandered a tall man in a bright blue t-shirt, shorts and flip flops. Dishevelled hair and a light smattering of salt and pepper stubble. It felt a bit like Tom Hanks had put it in one of my all time favourite romcoms, Sleepless In Seattle: ""It was like... coming home. Only, to no home I'd ever known"". We had a great time and decided to meet again the next day for a picnic. We sat near a river. It was a perfect summer's day. And I was about to make the strangest and most impulsive decision of my life.  ""Lorna.""  ""Yes?"" ""Will you marry me?""  I picked up a crisp. ""Yeah definitely,"" I replied.  ""Ok thank you,"" he said. ""Let's go for another swim.""  As proposals go, it was perfect. But I hadn't expected to say yes to a man I'd only met the day before.  Friends' reactions varied. One asked if this was a sketch for BBC Wales Sesh, a platform I contributed to regularly. Another asked if I was having a mental breakdown. One asked if I was perhaps the victim of a scam? Part of me knew it sounded crazy, getting engaged to someone after 24 hours. But it didn't feel any less right. Days after the engagement we discussed when we might see each other again.  ""I've got a three-bedroom flat. Why don't you move in?""  By November, we'd both settled into pandemic monotony. Getting engaged in a plague was all well and good, but we'd missed out on so much. It wasn't like the honeymoon period had ended - we hadn't had one! It was as though we'd been together 30 years!  It seemed improbably romantic. We had fallen in love at first sight. We'd lived, laughed and cried through months of difficulties - and still wanted to be together.  I have no regrets about getting engaged to a stranger and moving him into my flat within a week. We're not sure when we can actually get married. When we met last summer, we had hopes it could happen spring or early summer 2021, but the pandemic is making that seem increasingly unlikely. We'd really like his family and friends to be able to travel over from Brazil.  As we face our first Valentine's Day together, I wonder what we can do to celebrate it. Perhaps we'll take a chilly picnic to the park, and sit next to a river. For old time's sake. Although - relatively speaking - it isn't that long at all.  I hope my improbable real life love story inspires others seeking love online to keep going. As my mum's fond of saying: ""Mae na frÃ¢n i bob frÃ¢n"" - ""There's a crow for every crow"". It just happens that my crow is a Carioca.

The member of staff on the Ben-my-Chree, who does not work in a ""passenger-facing role"", was tested while not on duty and is now in self-isolation, a spokesman said. A ""handful"" of other crew members are also self-isolating and contact tracing is ongoing, he added. The vessel has undergone a deep clean. The Ben-my-Chree makes two daily return journeys between Douglas Harbour and Heysham Port in Lancashire. The island's border is currently closed to almost all non-residents but those living on the island can travel, provided they adhere to the strict Manx testing and self-isolation regime on return. The IOMSPC spokesman said the company had ""clear policies in place for its crew to prevent Covid spread on both its vessels and at its ports"".

New virus variants causing concern in Africa,"By Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check Experts believe the emergence of new coronavirus variations in Africa have contributed to in an increase in the number of both cases and deaths reported in many countries on the continent.  There's also concern that these variants can't easily be tracked because the the type of testing required to identify them isn't available in most countries. At least 40 countries have now seen a second wave of the pandemic, including all countries in the southern Africa region, says the Africa Centres for Disease Control (CDC). ""This new wave of infections is thought to be associated with the emergence of variants that are more transmissible."" A new variant of the virus emerged in South Africa last year, and has contributed to record case numbers in the southern African region, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Elsewhere in Africa, this variant has also been officially recorded in Botswana, Ghana, Kenya, Comoros, Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania. It's highly likely to have reached other countries on the continent, but few have the capacity to carry out the specialised genomic sequencing required to detect coronavirus variants. ""Initial analysis indicates that the [South African] variant... may spread more readily between people,"" according to the WHO.  It doesn't appear to cause more serious illness. However a new study shows the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - the first to have arrived in South Africa - offers ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases of Covid-19 arising from the new strain. The study by the University of the Witwatersrand didn't investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections. In South Africa itself, daily new case numbers have started to fall significantly after a second peak. And because there are many more cases in South Africa than anywhere else on the continent, this has resulted in an overall fall of 18% in new cases across the continent over the past month, according to the CDC. But there was a 40% increase in the number of deaths reported in January across the continenet compared with the previous month, according to the WHO, with total deaths on the continent now approaching 100,000. Thirty-two countries reported an increase in deaths over the period, while for 21 countries, the rate fell or remained the same. In Nigeria, scientists have also identified a new variant of the virus, although they say there is currently no evidence to indicate it is contributing to increased transmission. However, cases in Nigeria have been on the rise since early December, and are only just starting to trend downwards.

 During the first stage of the pandemic, Africa's overall fatality rates -the proportion of those with Covid who then die - were lower than those elsewhere in the world. There were a number of theories put forward as to why that might be the case, such as the relatively younger population, and possible cross-immunity from other coronaviruses. But the Africa CDC has now warned about rising fatality rates in the continent, saying that of the 55 countries they monitor, 20 are now reporting fatality rates above the current global average of 2.2%. The fatality rate for Africa has crept up since July last year when it was on average 2.1% - to 2.6% in February this year (measured over the duration of the pandemic). The WHO says the fatality rate is continuing to rise with the most recent data for the past month of 3.7%  The global fatality rate has fallen since the start of the pandemic, which in itself would put more African countries above the global average. And fatality rates are also affected by how much testing is done - a country with low levels of testing will show a higher death rate because many non-fatal Covid cases are going undetected.

                         More importantly, data for deaths should be treated with caution, given the wide variations in how countries record them. In South Africa, research into excess deaths  - that's the number of deaths in a certain period above what would normally be expected - shows that there were 83,918 between 6 May last year and 5 January this year. The official death toll from Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic is now over 47,000. And South Africa was just one of eight countries on the continent that the BBC found in a recent investigation had adequate death registration systems. So coronavirus deaths across Africa as a whole are likely to be under-recorded. The WHO says testing in Africa is still low compared to other regions, and there's also concern that irregular levels of testing over time may be masking the true spread of the virus. There are wide variations in testing rates and while some countries have reduced testing, others have maintained or even increased it at different points during the pandemic. Of the bigger countries, South Africa has been doing the most and Nigeria doing relatively few tests per capita, according to Our World in Data, a UK-based project which collates Covid-19 information. However, in some countries there are insufficient or no data available on testing to know how much is being done. Tanzania for example stopped releasing data in May last year. President John Magufuli has been insisting the country is free from the virus. The King's Global Health Institute, which tracks the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa, says that testing activity in some countries also fell back after the first wave of the virus had subsided. ""Those countries that cut back on testing after the first wave will...have had less extensive and timely intelligence from surveillance,"" it says.

Lockdown music project's first single released,"By Steve MatherBBC News The first single produced by a lockdown project supporting freelance musicians during the coronavirus pandemic has been released.  Sound World launched the scheme last year after Covid-19 wiped-out paid working opportunities for many self-employed musicians. The Bristol-based charity said it wanted to help performers by offering paid work rather than handouts. The Grace of Silence is the first single to be released.  Composer Dame Evelyn Glennie's original piece, based on the feelings associated with lockdown, was recorded by Harriet Riley and Paul Israel of the Bristol Ensemble.  Sound World asked 12 world-renowned composers to contribute their work for free, with only performers paid. Money raised through a Crowdfunding campaign ensured performers were paid for their work and they will also benefit from music sales and a planned live premiere.  Director of Sound World Julian Leeks said: ""It was clear in early March last year that things were going to be extremely tough for freelancers whose diaries were emptied overnight.  ""So we got in touch with a number of composers to ask if they would write some short pieces for us and we set up a Crowdfunding campaign so that we could pay the musicians to record them, in their homes, during lockdown. ""The responses from the composers and the public were incredibly generous. We raised enough money to record a complete album."" All of the songs written and recorded during lockdown will feature on an album called Reflections due for release in the late spring or early summer. Due to the unique circumstances, all the musicians had to record their parts separately in their own homes with the work knitted together by sound engineer Andy Keenan.  ""Andy has done an amazing job. You'd never know these weren't conventional studio recordings,"" said Mr Leeks. ""So as well as featuring some great sounds, the album tells a fascinating story of music during the lockdown and shows what can be achieved in the face of seemingly impossible circumstances."" The Grace of Silence: here is @DameEvelyn  talking about her new piece. Specially written for Sound World, it will be raising money to support freelance musicians. Performed by @harriet_riley & @Paul990 of @bristolensemble.Available from download/streaming sites from Friday pic.twitter.com/RoAqNMFvtM A live premiere featuring all of the compositions had been planned at St George's concert hall in May but has been postponed until later in the year.

Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales?,"The rate that coronavirus is being transmitted in the community is being watched keenly by health officials. As of 15 February, the reproduction (R) number remains within the range of between 0.7 and 0.9, according to the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (Tac).  It has been within this range for a few weeks but down from being between 0.8 and 1.1 in Wales in mid-January. Based on case rates, Public Health Wales (PHW) estimates the R number to be 0.8, slightly above the week before and the time it would take for cases to halve, between 15 to 20 days. The latest R number means for every 10 people with the virus in Wales, it would mean about seven people would be infected. Tac issued a warning of the need for continued vigilance in its latest report, saying that the ""best way to reduce the likelihood of new variants emerging is to keep infection rates low. Relaxing measures too early or quickly will lead to large numbers of hospitalisations and deaths."" It tells us how many people are likely to get infected from a person who is ill with coronavirus.  So if the R number is two, it means a sick person is likely to transmit the virus to two other people. This is how coronavirus spreads.  The lower the number the better - and under one is the aim. As restrictions are lifted, it often leads to the R number rising. So if R is 1 then, on average, 10 people infected with Covid-19 would pass it on to another 10 people.  But if R is 0.7 then, on average, 10 people who have caught coronavirus would pass it on to seven others, and so on. As of 11 February,  it was estimated to be between 0.7 and 0.9, the same as recent reports. Another estimate, made by Imperial College London, put it at about 0.66 on 10 February. Scientists say the R number is useful when coronavirus cases are going up or down, but with a low numbers of cases - as over the summer - it was hard to get a good handle on what was happening.  So the lower the number of positive cases, the less useful it is.  But with cases rising, the R number and growth rate are seen as more reliable tools again. This is also why it is also unreliable to try to estimate a R number for different regions of Wales. Tac said a low number of cases also meant the R number ""becomes very sensitive to daily changes"" in cases found through tracing, causing it to fluctuate weekly. The R number plays into a number of ""circuit-breaker"" tests, which health officials and scientists are looking at. The growth rate. This is put at a range of between -0.06 and -0.02 in Wales, indicating that infections could be shrinking by between 6% and 2% per day. Meanwhile, it has been estimated that 24,600 people in Wales had Covid in the week to 6 February. Analysis of thousands of swab results in a survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) means it can estimate that about one in 125 people, or 0.8% of the population. The R number in Wales is worked out by looking at eight different data sources - and it is then a weighted average of estimates.  This includes data from hospitalisations, confirmed cases, deaths and data from contact surveys, which includes a Welsh sample. The number of people with confirmed Covid in hospital had plateaued over recent weeks but remained high. In September, a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" was published, after what could happen over the winter and into next spring was modelled by experts at Swansea University. The worst case looked at 636,000 infections, leading to 18,200 hospital admissions - peaking in January - and potentially 6,300 deaths. There were concerns in early December that deaths were running ahead of this scenario in recent weeks. Earlier in the pandemic, the scientific advisers suggested an R of 0.8 would lead to 500 additional coronavirus deaths by the start of August and as many 7,000 if the R number reached 1.1. Initial estimates earlier in May suggested R 0.8 would lead to 800 more deaths and 7,200 if the rate hit 1.1. Tac said in its recent report that a consistent R number below 1 would lead to a reduction in cases and hospitalisations, while a consistent R number above 1 would lead to a rise. But they warn that a small increase in R above 1, maintained for three months, could have a ""huge impact"" on hospital demand and ""greatly increase"" the number of hospital admissions and deaths. The Sage group of UK scientific advisers is also looking at the speed and how quickly infections are changing each day. In Wales, incidence is highest in adults under 45, but high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in care homes. Mobility data for Wales also shows how lockdowns have changed behaviour - where we travel to, including trips to work and shops. Tac reported mobility data to the week of the 12 January via Google shows a reduction in people spending time at home compared to the week before at. There was an rise in trips to work, and a small increase for retail and recreation.  What is the UK's R number and why does it matter? Analysis: How do we get out of lockdown?

"Man denies giving woman, 92, fake vaccine","A man has denied tricking a 92-year-old woman out of Â£260 for a fake coronavirus vaccination. David Chambers is accused of administering the fake vaccine to Kathleen Martin at her Surbiton home on 30 December for Â£160 and returning five days later for a further Â£100. The 33-year-old pleaded not guilty at Kingston Crown Court to two counts of fraud and one count of battery. Judge Judith Coello set a trial date for 9 August. Mr Chambers, from Surbiton, appeared at court via a video-link from Wandsworth Prison and was remanded in custody. It follows an investigation by the Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU) at City of London Police. In the UK, coronavirus vaccines are free of charge and available through the NHS.

Meet Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine volunteers,"By Naomi Holland & Iain McDowellBBC News NI Almost a quarter of adults in Northern Ireland have received their first vaccination dose since Belfast Health Trust nurse Joanna Sloan became the first recipient on 8 December.  BBC News NI has been speaking to some of the volunteers helping to ensure as many people as possible are immunised. Patients are being offered vaccines in order of priority, based on their age and clinical vulnerability. On 12 January, the Department of Health published a detailed timetable for delivering vaccinations to those prioritised groups. The vaccination rate in Northern Ireland remains above that in the Republic of Ireland - if slightly lower than in other UK nations. The Covid-19 vaccine rollout in Northern Ireland is an unprecedented public health operation. As well as current frontline healthcare staff, retired doctors, nurses and members of the public have been pitching in. A year-and-a-half after retiring from his practice in Rathfriland, County Down, Dr Donal O'Shaughnessy has returned to help out twice a week administering vaccines. He felt duty-bound to help ""to get the vaccines out as quickly as possible among the people I've lived with and worked with for so many years"". A former doctor for the Ireland, Ulster and Barbarians rugby teams, he said it was great to be involved in the clinics, as well as to see former patients. ""I'm just so glad that I'm able to give something back to all of these good people at this stage when I thought I was home and dry and out of it completely,"" said Dr O'Shaughnessy. The uptake for the vaccine in the Rathfriland area had been very high, he said, and he was hopeful that would continue as the rollout continues through younger age groups. ""We might need to give them an injection every year from now on,"" he said. ""I would still be available to do that."" ""There is a great sense of hope. That is the most positive thing. It's a very rewarding experience."" Alan Law has been registered with the organisation Volunteer Now for five years and has helped out at events such as the Irish Open golf tournament and the Giro D'Italia cycle race. Now he is spending his free time at the Craigavon and Ballymena vaccination hubs, welcoming those coming for their jabs and helping them through the process. He said the reaction from the public had been fantastic and there was a real sense of relief and happiness. ""There's a lot of people coming who have been shielding or isolating for months now and they feel like this is a lifeline,"" he said. ""They are now going to be get their life back. Be able to go out more, and do things that they have been pausing for such a long time."" Garrett Martin was an emergency department nurse for many years before moving into senior management roles in the health service and then to the Royal College of Nursing. When the first cases of coronavirus emerged in Northern Ireland, he began looking for a way to get back into frontline care and, before Christmas, was offered the role of operations manager at the Western Health Trust's vaccination centres. His team at the Foyle Arena in Londonderry is dealing with up to 750 people every day. His staff include: ""It's been full-on, it's been incredibly hard work but it's been incredibly rewarding as well,"" he said. ""What we're going through is monumental, it's historic and will be talked about for some time. ""So to play a some part, however small, in the recovery is something we're very proud and privileged to be to be part of."" Victoria Simpson has gone from administering routine childhood immunisations to vaccinating the elderly against Covid-19 in care homes. She has been redeployed from her job as a health visitor in Lisburn to the vaccination centre at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. About 1,200 people a day are being vaccinated at the site, and she said that between filling in paperwork and giving patients the information they need, the actual giving of the vaccine is the quickest part of the whole process. She said: ""It's just sometimes overwhelming just to think about the enormity of this programme and just how well it's all working. ""I'm feeling really privileged to be in this position and this is definitely going to be one for the history books to chat to the grandchildren about."" Just a few months ago, no Covid-19 vaccine had been approved for use in the UK. Today there are three: Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca - which are currently being administered - and Moderna, which the UK has ordered 17 million doses of but is not due to start arriving until spring. But use of two different types of vaccine in Northern Ireland has also led to some confusion. The Pfizer-BioNTech jab has to be stored and handled in a specific way which makes it harder to use in the community, so it has been mainly reserved for use in the health service vaccination hubs where frontline healthcare workers have received their vaccines. Breakdown by trust â¬ï¸ pic.twitter.com/yYnH7weXz3 The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to store and administer, and has therefore been distributed to GP practices across Northern Ireland. At the end of January, a decision was taken to open the vaccination hubs to members of the public aged from 65 to 69, while people aged over 70 would continue to be vaccinated by their GP.

Lockdown saw 'inevitable' rise in domestic abuse,"Reported cases of domestic abuse rose by 10% in 2020 with lockdowns having an ""inevitable"" impact, police said.  Rosie, whose ex-partner was jailed after fracturing her skull, said she was ""lucky to have left with her life"".  Avon and Somerset Police logged 2,000 more cases of domestic abuse crimes last year than in 2019. The force said the rise could be due to increased reporting adding that victims fleeing domestic abuse were exempt from coronavirus restrictions. Supt Deryck Rees said the force takes reports of domestic abuse ""extremely seriously"" and was working to ""make sure all victims are receiving the support they need"".  Mr Rees continued: ""We are still here and we're still listening. If you suspect, or you are experiencing domestic abuse, we urge you to seek help as soon as possible.""  Sarah O'Leary, the chief executive of Next Link charity, said it had ""remained open and responsive throughout lockdown"" and that it could still ""react to people who need help and support"".  She said it received 5,700 reports of people needing help in March 2019 and had received 7,500 reports in March 2020 - an increase of more than 30%.  Rosie (not her real name), is one such person who been helped by Next Link. Her ex-partner was jailed for 25 months after he fractured her skull.  She said: ""The lockdown started to happen really fast and I was very scared. I had been made redundant and I knew that he had been furloughed at the start of the pandemic.  ""I was convinced - or he'd had me convinced - that he had changed his life around.  ""I was in bed, it was a Sunday morning and he had been up all night. I was woken up by him dragging me out of bed by my hair.   ""He dragged me around and was slamming my head against every kind of doorframe and surface along the way. He was drunk to the point that he was unrecognisable.  ""At one point I tried to escape from the front door but he pulled me back so hard that my neck flew backwards.  ""I had a fractured skull, we were in the middle of the pandemic and the hospitals were almost like a no-go area.  ""But I decided after he carried on harassing me that I couldn't live my life in this way.  ""I knew my life would be turned upside down and I couldn't live in my home anymore.  ""I knew all these things were going to happen and I just needed to build up the courage to call somebody and get some help.  ""I called the police 11 days after it happened. He was arrested the same day. They dealt with the situation in a really considerate way. They didn't make me feel that I wouldn't be believed."" Avon and Somerset's Police and Crime Commissioner, Sue Mountstevens, said: ""Being stuck at home at the moment can be a bit like Groundhog Day but just think if Groundhog Day was unsafe.

Covid-19 and Brexit prioritised in government plan,"Guernsey's Policy and Resources Committee has submitted its government plan for the next four years. The Covid-19 pandemic, the effects of Brexit and a list of recovery actions have been identified as the government's three imminent priorities. Vice-president Deputy Heidi Soulsby said ""difficult decisions"" had to be made in order to cope with the island's ""limited"" finances. The policy letter is due to be debated by States members on 17 March. Stage one of the government plan will respond to the ""unprecedented fiscal challenges"" Guernsey faces, the Policy and Resources Committee said. It estimates the States spent an extra Â£50m in 2020 to support those most adversely affected by the pandemic. The committee said the island was ""likely to see a deterioration in the financial landscape for 2021"", and ""significant resources"" would need to be allocated to the pandemic's management ""for some time to come"". The letter adds that the States would need to consider borrowing money to invest in the island's infrastructure. Legislation earmarked as a high priority for the government this political term includes the drafting of the anti-discrimination laws agreed in principle last year. The government plan has also prioritised the introduction of better regulation for Guernsey's healthcare services, and the licensing of roll on/roll off ferry services from Condor at St Peter Port. The government has also proposed the withdrawal of 135 previously agreed resolutions which are ""no longer reflective of the needs of today"", the letter states. Among these are all previously agreed proposals for secondary education reform, which were put on hold last March to allow a review by the Committee for Education Sport and Culture. Deputy Soulsby said: ""The ambition of the new Assembly is prodigious so it will need to make difficult decisions and these proposals prepare the way for this. ""It is a huge task to bring all this work into one plan and it is important that in March, the Assembly provides the executive decisions to help the committee carry on its work.""

How to pimp your online dating profile,"We know. You wanted to spot someone across a crowded bar, get chatting, take their number, meet up for cocktails or coffees and eventually move in and get a dog together. You didn't think you'd be spending your prime years swiping endlessly on dating apps, answering, ""How's lockdown treating you? aha x"" for the third time today.  But that's life for now, so you might as well get good at it. And dating and relationship specialist Ella Stearn is here to help. She has these top tips for getting the most out of dating apps, including how to do yourself justice with your profile. Group pictures show that you're ""sociable and you like to spend time with friends and family,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. But you need to chose them carefully. Depending on who else is in the photo, it can be surprisingly hard to tell who you are. And because of how quickly people swipe on dating apps, that might lose you some matches. ""You could blur out the others, I've seen some people do black and white on the others and just put themselves in colour. That's one solution,"" says Ella. ""But if you do put the group pictures on make sure they're not one of the first on your page. Put them lower down."" So, no confusing group pictures - but what photos should you use? Ella says it's important to ""use your photos wisely"". ""You want your pictures to show not tell. If you like travel, don't just write on your profile 'I like to travel'. That's getting really old, everyone says it.  ""Instead, use those pictures to show your favourite travel photos,"" she says. On dating apps with prompts where you can write about yourself, use these to ""complement your pictures"". Okay, we're getting there. But when it comes to selecting the right pictures, it can still feel like a bit of a minefield.  If you watched last year's series of Love Island, you might remember Shaughna saying, ""Leanne, what if he takes, like, mirror selfies?"" It was met with a chorus of ""ewww""s from the other girls.  Still donât understand Leanne saying if a man takes mirror selfies for Instagram itâs a big problem and all the girls agreed... sorry what? This show gives me a headache  #loveisland Ella says you can't get caught up in worrying what people will think of your pictures: ""At the end of the day, people just need to see what you look like."" ""If taking a serious photo isn't really you, have fun with it,"" she suggests. ""If you're comfortable taking a photo of yourself, take it. It's just about being confident and being happy in who you are."" Pictures sorted, now on to the words. Different apps work differently, but most have a section where you can write a bit about yourself. Ella's top tip is to do just that - write something but don't leave it blank. And here are her dos and don'ts. If lockdown meant you're getting into dating apps for the first time, opening lines can be hard to get used to. The good news is on a lot of these apps, if you've got to the point where you can send a message, the other person is interested. Ella says one thing to avoid is just saying ""hi"". ""Instead, use their profile and pick up on something that they've written or something in one of their pictures,"" she says. ""Make it fun, and jokey. Or even complimentary."" Sorry, we can't do the work for you here, because Ella says there's no one-size-fits-all answer. The most important thing is that it should ""always be personal"". ""Lockdown has been really, really tough on our love lives,"" Ella says. But that's no excuse if you're looking to date. ""There's been such a rise in intentional dating, with more people looking for something serious because they're reminded of the value of human connection. And, of course, people have so much more free time."" If you're bored with messaging, set up phone calls and virtual date nights, says Ella. ""You have to change your outlook. Have fun with it - just imagine how amazing it will be when you can date these people properly and meet up with them in real life."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Induced coma woman warns others about Covid-19,"A woman who was put into an induced coma for 13 days after contracting coronavirus has urged people to follow restrictions. Amanda Wilson, 49, had a sore throat and felt sick before she tested positive on Christmas Eve.  She was found to have blood clots on her lungs and was put into the induced coma on New Year's Day.  Ms Wilson, a bus driver, said she had to learn how to walk again after being so ill.  She left hospital last week and hopes to return to work next month. Initially treated at the Swindon's Great Western Hospital, she was transferred to the specialist Harefield Hospital, near Watford. The mother-of-one was then put into the induced coma after doctors decided her vital organs were at risk of failing.    Ms Wilson, from Swindon, was left shocked by the impact it had on her as she has no underlying health conditions and is not overweight.  ""I wear my mask, I keep my distance, I don't make non-essential trips and when I go to work it's deep cleaned and kept in as clean a condition as possible,"" she said. ""I smell like I wear eau de disinfectant. It's scary how it can affect a healthy younger person so extremely and people shouldn't ever be complacent.""   She added: ""As far as making a full recovery is concerned, I've learned how to walk again because you lose all use of your legs.  ""My voice has changed because of how they shove tubes down your throat. Sometimes it can scrape your voice box and that's what happened. But that'll come back over time.

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Friday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The Bank of England's chief economist has predicted that the British economy will surge back from the latest coronavirus lockdown, thanks to the vaccine programme and large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"". Writing in the Daily Mail, Andy Haldane said the economy was like a ""coiled spring"" and that due to the number of vulnerable people who would have been vaccinated, restrictions could be eased so that people were socialising and spending by the summer. Figures released on Friday morning show the UK economy shrank by a record 9.9% in 2020. Documents seen by the BBC suggest the quarantine rulesÂ forÂ passengers arriving in England from coronavirus ""red list"" countries - which comes into force on Monday - will be less strict than those enforced by Australia. While Australian rules do not allow guests to mix with security staff, the England will allow people to be escorted outside for ""a smoke or fresh air"". There are other differences around meal deliveries and what kind of protective equipment security and hotel staff should wear - with the government only saying surgical masks should be used, compared with the more protective N95 ones used in Australia.Â  Young people's job prospects have been hit hard by the pandemic, with workers under the age of 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment. Among them is Jamie Gillam. The 22-year-old graduate of King's College London has applied for 200 jobs without success. Young people have also been disproportionately affected by redundancies, says the Institute for Employment Studies, because they tend to work in the hardest-hit sectors such as hospitality and tourism.  It's hard to escape the fact that for babies, toddlers and pre-schoolers, the coronavirus lockdowns have made up a significant part of their young lives. Does this mean we should be concerned they are missing out on socialising, learning, having routines and getting outside? We've tried to answer some of these concerns here, and also look at where to get more help if you're locked down with little ones - and how to look after your own mental health. When Northern Irish singer JC Stewart recorded a parody video of the theme tune from the TV sitcom Friends during lockdown, it went viral, and was even shared by cast member Jennifer Aniston.  While the video - and its subtle change of lyrics to reflect the pandemic - brought worldwide attention, he has actually been releasing music since 2014. The singer-songwriter has four million monthly listeners on Spotify, thanks to melancholy, soul-baring ballads like I Need You To Hate Me and Lying That You Love Me.

'We're celebrating Chinese New Year virtually',"By Jamie MorelandBBC London London usually hosts some of the biggest Chinese New Year celebrations outside Asia, but this year they have been cancelled due to the pandemic. Each year, Chinatown would be crammed with crowds attracted to performances, food stalls and decorations. However, the London Chinatown Chinese Association (LCCA) is urging people to follow lockdown rules and stay at home. The LCCA has created a ""virtual celebration"" which will be streamed on its YouTube channel on 14 February. Lawrence Lee, from the LCCA, told the BBC: ""Normally we have about 700,000 people attending our celebration here with five stages, dance troupes from China and a parade.  ""But this year it's impossible to do."" He added he would ""normally be celebrating with my children and having a wonderful time, but this year it will only be me and my wife.  ""So we will have a meal and watch the online performances."" Alva and her husband Steve, who live on the Isle of Dogs, are keeping their children entertained with Chinese New Year themed arts and crafts. Five-year-old Libby and three-year-old Ally drew oxen and created a lion hat from a cardboard box. Steve said the family ""used to visit museums where they'd put on shows to explain Chinese New Year, helping the girls understand their culture.  ""That's something we'll miss."" However, he said they ""have bought a whole new shelf of books about Chinese New Year"" to make up for it. Alva added: ""We planned to go back to Hong Kong, but we can't do that, so we might have a virtual party with my parents instead."" Libby said she had ""done lots of craft and made food"" before practising her lion dance. Chinese New Year is usually the ""busiest business day"" according to Simon Tang, who owns four bakeries in Chinatown. ""People like to celebrate with cakes,"" he said. ""They have parties and we share buns, which are nice and sweet for a happy new year traditionally. ""Many of our bakeries are closed and staff are on furlough, but we still do deliveries. ""I think Chinatown is missed by Londoners and we miss our customers. It's best everybody stays at home and stays safe."" He added that it was apt this year will be the Year of the Ox. ""The ox is a very hard-working animal in the zodiac. It will be a very challenging year but through perseverance we hope everybody can be healthy and prosperous,"" he said.

Second Covid support scheme opens for taxi drivers,"Stormont has opened a second Covid-19 support fund for NI taxi drivers that will cover those who were ineligible in the first round.  The scheme, which launched on Friday, will cover 12 months from 22 March 2020 to 21 March 2021.  It will also cover drivers who could not access the scheme because they had paused their insurance.  Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said the new fund closed the ""gaps"". In December, it emerged that almost half of Northern Ireland's taxi drivers failed to apply for a previous emergency support grant set up by Stormont. Ms Mallon said: ""While support has been put in place, there have been gaps, which is why I stepped up to provide support for the bus and coach industry and for our taxi drivers.  ""It aims to address two issues: first, to provide further support to all eligible taxi drivers for this 12 month period, and second, to now provide financial assistance specifically for those drivers who have had partial insurance during this period.""  She added: ""Taking on board learning from the first taxi driver scheme, the application process has also been simplified to address the concerns raised by the sector and this time round drivers will be able to directly contact the department through a dedicated information line for the scheme."" Eligible drivers will get up to Â£3,000, which includes any payment made to them under the first scheme, Ms Mallon said.  Drivers who are unable to work because they are shielding, but still incurring overheads, will also be able to apply. The scheme is in addition to support for self-employed taxi drivers, such as the self employment income support scheme.  It will be open until 26 February 2021.

Pandemic 'having crushing impact on young lives',"The pandemic is having a ""crushing impact"" on children and young people's lives, the Children's Commissioner for Wales has said. It comes as a report into the impact of the current Covid lockdown revealed how 30% of 17 and 18-year-olds said they were worried ""most of the time"". The views of 20,000 children and teenagers in Wales were represented in the report by Prof Sally Holland. One teenager feels ""more isolated, less motivated"" than in previous lockdowns. The report, called Coronavirus and Me, is the second commissioned by Prof Holland, who ran a similar survey in May during the first lockdown. The new one found ""markedly fewer"" of the 12 to 18-year-olds who responded to the online survey saying they were happy ""most of the time"". It said the rates of children saying they felt worried ""most of the time"" were ""notably higher"" during the current lockdown. Prof Holland said: ""It is obvious from these survey results that, despite the enormous efforts of our schools, colleges, youth workers, social services and health services, the pandemic is having a crushing impact on many young lives."" She added it was clear children and young people of all ages were ""missing not only formal learning but also the socialisation and support that school and college has to offer"". In Wales, schools and colleges have been shut since Christmas when there were rising rates of Covid infections.  Foundation phase pupils are due to start a phased return to school from the Monday after half-term, although some local authority areas have said they might have to delay reopening because of concerns over infection rates. Eighteen-year-old Ellie Kidd, who is studying for a Level 3 BTEC in sport, said she had been finding this lockdown tougher than the first. ""I've definitely struggled with my mental health through this lockdown in particular,"" said Ellie, who lives in Flintshire. ""I just feel more isolated, less motivated. I can call my friends but it doesn't feel the same as having the social interaction. It's been quite difficult."" She said she was often in the house alone as her mother and step-father were both keyworkers. She added: ""I had a week after Christmas when I felt very low, I kept thinking, 'How are we going to get out of this?'. I know there are vaccines now but sometimes I just keep thinking, 'when is it going to end?'."" The report said children as young as three described missing friends, relatives and experiences and 40% of 17-year-olds reported they felt lonely 'most of the time'. It also found children and young people of black, Asian and other ethnic minority ethnicities and disabled youngsters were more likely to feel lonely and less likely to say they feel safe. However, the report also found many children and young people said they were enjoying spending time at home and were receiving good support from schools and youth workers. Luca Zenati-Parsons, 15, said his schoolwork had been improving during lockdown. ""I get to do it in my own time and on my own - there's no-one being loud in class,"" said Luca, from Caerphilly, who usually goes to school in Pontypridd.  ""I prefer to be in my own little zone."" Prof Holland said she hoped the results of the report would give a ""clear road-map"" for the Welsh Government on what needed to be prioritised for children and young people over the next weeks and months. The report's findings have already been shared with the Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Cell (TAC) and she said it would also be sent to SAGE, the UK's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. She added the first priority for students returning to schools and colleges may need to be ""providing time to talk about their experiences, opportunities to be with friends and to play and also the chance to reflect on and be proud of what they have achieved during the pandemic"". A Welsh Government spokesperson said the results of the survey from May had been used ""extensively"" to decision on policy ranging from education to recent alert levels. They added: ""The new set of findings will now also be considered as a key source of evidence when future decisions are made.""

Valentine's Day chef is busier than ever,"By Charley AdamsBBC News Lockdown restrictions have taken the usual Valentine's Day routine of candle-lit restaurant dinners off the menu in 2021. But for some businesses a change from typical romantic traditions has brought about a welcome surge in trade.  A chef offering takeaway meals on 14 February says it is a ""blessing"" how busy he will be. ""We've had masses of interest and could have filled the restaurant seven times over,"" said Simon Hulstone. Mr Hulstone, who runs The Elephant in Torquay with his wife Katy, said instead of being restricted to restaurant space, this year ""we can do as many as we can physically prepare for and sell"". He tweeted celebrating this as the ""one year that Valentine's actually works out well"", where they can cook for 150 couples instead of serving 20 tables of two in the Michelin star restaurant. The one year that valentines actually works out well. Not 20 tables of two in the restaurant on a Saturday night now we can do 150 twos via takeaway. #SwingsAndRoundabouts ""In reality it's one day of almost 100 that we are due to be closed so we really need to take advantage of the situation,"" added Mr Hulstone. He said the workload was different as there was ""a lot of pre-preparation to do"" so the food could be reheated at home, but there was no busy service on the day or ""impulsive proposals in the restaurant"".  However, the chef said as well as struggling to prepare for so many customers, sourcing products had been a challenge.  ""Brexit has thrown a whole heap of supplier issues our way,"" he said, citing strawberries and roses as two products that had been harder to get hold of.  Pubs, bars and restaurants in England were forced to close under lockdown rules, but they can offer food and non-alcoholic drinks for takeaway until 23:00 GMT.  A florist said her ""business is booming"" in the lead-up to Valentine's Day.  Hannah Burnett, who runs a florist in Plymouth, said the business was usually quieter when Valentine's Day fell on a weekend, but lockdown had changed things this year.  ""As soon as February started we seemed to get a flood of enquiries and emails about orders."" The florist said with shops closed people ""are being more organised"" and customers were choosing more expensive flowers, ""rather than the minimum spend"" this year.  She said despite about 70 weddings getting postponed last year, the business had done ""well throughout the last 12 months"" by focussing on deliveries and funeral work.  ""As a florist, Valentines is always one of the days throughout the year that gives us a boost."" February is normally a quieter month for the florist and with weddings delayed for a few months, ""being this much busier already for Valentines is just amazing"", she told the BBC. Some restaurants have decided to stay closed for lockdown and not offer a takeaway service this Sunday.  Ryan Marsland, who runs a restaurant with his wife Tanya, said: ""It ""wasn't an easy thing to not do Valentine's - it goes against everything you want to do"". The Fig Tree @36 in Plymouth closed a few days before the third national lockdown in England was announced.  ""Saying no to people isn't any fun, but you have to stick to your guns really,"" explained Mr Marsland. Despite being confident there would be customers for Valentine's the couple decided to completely close because they are home-schooling their children and staff are on furlough. ""We've got the kids here, a four and six-year-old, home-schooling, and that takes up a big chunk of the day,"" he said. ""It's too much, we live in the restaurant too and the kids are always around."" 'Most romantic village's' Valentine's Day plea Will the UK's pubs stay shut until May? Can you still go to the pub?

Melbourne to lock down with fans barred from Open,"The Australian state of Victoria will enter lockdown for a third time in a bid to suppress an outbreak of the UK strain of coronavirus. Officials this week found 13 cases stemming from a quarantine worker who became infected at a Melbourne hotel. The lockdown will begin on Friday midnight and end on Wednesday. However, the government has said the Australian Open tennis tournament would continue in the state's capital, Melbourne. Spectators will be banned from attending the event from Saturday, which had previously allowed up to 30,000 visitors a day. Tickets will be refunded, tournament director Craig Tiley said. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the current outbreak was not linked to the quarantine hotels used by the tennis players. He stressed that a ""circuit breaker"" was needed to combat the ""hyper-infectious"" strain which he said had likely already seeded other infections in the community. ""This is the fastest-moving, most infectious strain of coronavirus that we have seen,"" he said, adding that almost 1,000 close contacts had already been reached. Prior to this outbreak, Victoria had not seen a local infection for 28 days and the state had largely eliminated the virus. Many Melbourne residents have expressed dismay but also resignation over the retreat into lockdown again. Last year, in Australia's winter, the city endured one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns to overcome a second wave which led to more than 90% of Australia's 29,000 cases and 909 deaths. ""We've built something precious, and we have to make difficult decisions, and do difficult things, in order to defend what we've built,"" Mr Andrews said. ""I am confident that this short, sharp circuit breaker will be effective. We will be able to smother this."" The state will be under the following restrictions for five days: Meanwhile, South Australia, Queensland and Western Australia have announced travel bans on people from Melbourne. Further border closures are expected. International flights to Melbourne will also be cancelled, authorities said. The tough ride continues for the Australian Open as Covid and controversy strike again.  When I was there reporting on the event's opening weekend, the tennis fans I spoke to said how happy they were for sport to have come back to Melbourne. ""We're just grateful,"" one fan, Angela, told me as she walked around the park. ""We know how much this is worth. We know how much we've struggled to achieve that."" The city went through a traumatic, lengthy lockdown last July after a quarantine breach led to more than 18,000 cases. Now the city is going back into lockdown again and for many it's a dispiriting dÃ©jÃ  vu. Confined to their homes, they're also asking why the tennis is still going ahead. Why will players and their teams get to move around and play matches while the people of Melbourne will have to stay home? Melbourne becomes the fourth Australian city - joining Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide - to enter a snap lockdown since November. In each situation, the cases have occurred due to a quarantine hotel breach - with all but one of these found to be the more infectious UK variant.  Victorian health authorities have been scrambling to find out how the virus leaked out, with particular focus being paid to airborne transmission. Officials say the UK variant is ""hyper-infectious"". But experts in the past week have questioned why stronger aerosol protections weren't in place when the threat of airborne transmission was previously known.

"Economy like a coiled spring, says Bank economist","The UK economy is like a ""coiled spring"" ready to release large amounts of ""pent-up financial energy"", the Bank of England's chief economist has said.  Andy Haldane said consumer confidence would surge back thanks to the vaccine programme, with the economy firing ""on all cylinders"" by spring.  He is the latest economist to forecast a sharp rebound in growth after an expected easing of restrictions. The economy is currently set to shrink 4.2% in the first three months of 2021. Writing in the Daily Mail, Mr Haldane said: ""With 13 million of the most vulnerable people already vaccinated, the risk of death or hospitalisation in the UK has already probably halved. ""By the end of March, based on the current pace of vaccine rollout and government data on vulnerable groups, this risk may have been reduced by as much as three-quarters and by the end of the second quarter it will be even smaller."" As a result, he said health concerns would fall and restrictions lift, allowing people to return to spending and socialising. The turn in sentiment was likely to be rapid, he added - ""a light-switch being flicked rather than a dimmer-switch being turned"". ""Having been bottled in for a year, most people are desperate to get their lives, including their social lives, back. ""When given the opportunity to do so safely, they will seize it,"" he said.  He said shared social experiences - from pubs to sports to cinema - would benefit, as glimpsed last summer during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. And unlike past recessions, he added, many UK households had strengthened their finances during lockdown and would have more money to spend.  ""That might mean two pub, cinema or restaurant visits a week rather than one,"" he said. ""It might mean a higher-spec TV or car or house."" On top of this he said a significant number of companies had amassed cash during the crisis, which would likely be invested as restrictions started to ease. ""That would be good news for jobs, helping to recover some of the million lost so far in this crisis,"" Mr Haldane wrote. ""And it would be good news for business investment too, helping companies boost their performance and productivity - and, ultimately, the pay of their workers."" With continued government support added to the mix, he said a strong bounce-back was assured. ""The economy is poised like a coiled spring. As its energies are released, the recovery should be one to remember after a year to forget.""

'My business may shut because of insurance delays',"By Simon ReadPersonal finance reporter Sonia Rishi fears her business could close because of delays in Covid-insurance pay-outs. The Supreme Court ruled last month that insurers must pay out on business interruption insurance policies for the first national lockdown. But with no sign that she will be paid any time soon, Ms Rishi is getting desperate. ""While insurers delay the claim process, small businesses like ours will close,"" she told the BBC. More than 60 insurers, including Arch, Argenta, MS Amlin, Hiscox, QBE and RSA, offered business interruption policies, but many refused to pay out during the first lockdown. They argued that only the most specialist policies had cover for such unprecedented restrictions. As a result, a test case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority which eventually led to the Supreme Court ruling. It covered issues such as disease clauses, whether business were denied access to the properties, and the timing of lost earnings, but the ruling was complex. Because of that it may take time to process firms' claims. The Association of British Insurers advises: ""Business interruption claims can, in general, be complex to assess and determine quantification."" It's that process that insurers are now going through which is, in some cases, leading to a frustrating wait for customers. Ms Rishi runs the Skin & Sanctuary wellbeing clinic, in east London, which was forced to close at the start of the first lockdown in March 2020. ""We submitted a claim on the basis of the terms of the business interruption clause in the insurance policy sold to us,"" she said. ""But ten months later, and after a High Court ruling and Supreme Court Appeal ruling, both of which basically confirmed what we had cited in March, we were told by our insurer Hiscox that we effectively had to provide details again."" The insurer told Ms Rishi: ""So that we can assess your eligibility for cover, we invite you to progress your claim by entering your details onto our business interruption claims portal."" But she said: ""This is insulting. There is no reason why payment for the claim submitted in March 2020 should be further delayed.""  She has been told by her broker that Hiscox said they will deal with only 20 cases per day. She told the BBC: ""If that is the case this will delay things sufficiently for businesses like ours to have to close. ""I really do not have anything left and have already borrowed Â£50,000 to keep things going."" Hiscox refused to comment on the 20 cases a day claim, but told the BBC: ""We have contacted all customers who have made a claim.  ""We have asked for more information where necessary and have begun settling claims as quickly as possible in line with the judgment."" Anna Smart also fears her business could be forced to shut. She runs a photography studio in Oxfordshire with husband Robin, but when her claim for business interruption insurance was turned down she was forced to make her one member of staff redundant and move out of their premises. After last month's Supreme Court judgment she expected a payout, but instead received a another claim rejection email from Hiscox. The insurer said: ""Based on the information that you have provided, we believe that your business was not subject to mandatory closure due to the relevant government restrictions.  ""If we have misunderstood the nature of your business activities and you were subject to mandatory closure, or if you consider that the impact on your business was one of those rare circumstances where an inability to use can be established, please contact us so that we can consider the specifics of your situation."" Ms Smart said: ""This is clearly very wrong. It is a stalling tactic. I believe there is a scandal brewing, not least as the insurers continue to try and 'thin the herd' to reduce claims."" On Wednesday, she put in a new claim, but told the BBC time is running out: ""The business will run out of cash by the end of March.""

Chinatowns fighting racism and pandemic to survive,"By Sophie WilliamsBBC News Lunar New Year is usually the busiest period for businesses in Chinatowns around the globe. But in 2020, it coincided with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, leaving many restaurants empty. A year on, the BBC speaks to business owners to find out how they survived - and what's next. Sam Wo's has been a fixture in San Francisco's Chinatown for more than a century, but the last year has been hard.  Coronavirus has forced restaurants across the world to shut their doors, and Chinatowns have been hit particularly hard. The virus first emerged in late 2019 in the Chinese city of Wuhan, leaving businesses like Sam Wo fighting not just fear, but anti-Asian sentiment.  ""All the Italian restaurants in North Beach were still busy and packed and then you went through the tunnel to Union Square and those guys had lines waiting to get in. And then you drive around Chinatown and it's completely empty,"" recalls Sam Wo's co-owner Steven Lee, describing the weeks before shutdown orders came in early last year.  ""So we know that xenophobia was affecting small businesses. Why would other districts be busy and we're not?""  In the 12 months since, it has been forced to cut its staff numbers from 23 to three due to a lack of customers. ""People wouldn't show up, they were just scared,"" Mr Lee tells the BBC. ""We had to rally and tell people to fight the virus, not the people and all this kind of stuff - but it didn't help much."" In Yokohama, home of Japan's largest Chinatown, it went beyond just people avoiding local businesses. Notes containing anti-Chinese messages were left on the doors of several restaurants last March.  They were already in deep trouble financially: sales figures had plummeted to about 10% of what they were in a typical peak period.  Yokohama's mayor came out in support of the businesses, telling local media that he was ""utterly infuriated"" with the letters.  In response, locals rallied around Yokohama's Chinatown, sending messages of support on social media, telling businesses to ""hang in there"" and promising to visit their establishments. And then, the shutdowns arrived, meaning the restaurants were unable to open their doors. ""I know many businesses in Chinatown have closed. It's terrifying,"" Ying Hou, who runs Shandong MaMa in the Australian city of Melbourne, tells the BBC. ""There are gift houses where tourists come to buy souvenirs - most of them didn't make it and have closed down."" She has also suffered following the introduction of one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in the middle of last year. Ms Ying says her business is still making only 50% of what it was making before the pandemic and so she has turned to making frozen dumplings that customers can cook at home. Luckily, they sell well: Shandong MaMa is the only place in this Chinatown to sell fish dumplings.  Melbourne gave rent relief to many Chinatown businesses last year, but for Ms Hou, that has now come to an end.  ""If we continue paying the full rent with the 50% income, then we are really going to go broke."" Her main goal for the next year or so? ""To survive,"" she said.  In New York's Chinatown, Karho Leung, founder of barber shop 12 Pell, has also thought of new ways to bring in customers.  ""Chinatown in New York City is the one place in the world that never really closes. We don't close for Christmas, we don't close for New Years, only a handful end up closing for Chinese New Years."" But last year, even the essential shops had closed by May.  ""Everything was a ghost town and it was really scary to see,"" he said.  When it was time to reopen, he looked at ways of preparing his business for customers. Taking inspiration from Hong Kong, he added dividers, temperature checks and humidifiers to keep the air fresh, before putting together a video for social media. It went viral, explaining to customers what safety measures were in place.  ""We saw the spike immediately and it was the busiest week we ever had in our lives, and then the next week was super silent,"" he said. ""There were probably fewer than 20 clients who ended up booking and then we started getting worried."" Mr Leung realised it wasn't just his business that had a lack of customers. The shop 12 Pell is located on ""barber's row"" and many other stylists were just hanging around with nobody to serve.  It was then that he decided to offer free haircuts to people who spent $45 in Chinatown. All they had to do was show their receipts.  ""We looked at our situation and we thought, we have nobody that's coming in anyway. Why don't we offer everybody a deal?"" The company has also worked on other social media initiatives such as getting its audience to order directly from restaurants instead of companies such as Uber Eats.  ""We were leveraging social media as a main way to push the younger audience to come back,"" Mr Leung said.  Send Chinatown Love, a group of New Yorkers, is also trying to help businesses by working with them to start a website, create their own social media accounts and in some cases help redesign menus and logos.  ""Everything started happening around January, February of last year, which is the most lucrative and joyous and festive times for Chinatown. They took a hit with that business and lost most of it,"" Louise Palmer, a representative for the group, said. ""So they ended up going into lockdown in March at a deficit, which kind of set a really terrible precedent for what the rest of the year would look like."" The organisation is also promoting Chinatown on social media, creating ""food crawls"" they hope will help increase foot traffic.  In San Francisco, foot traffic is already increasing. With the reintroduction of outdoor dining, many places have put in place outdoor seating so that customers can eat outside.  It has given Sam Wo's co-owner hope. ""I was there last week in Chinatown on Saturday and it was booming,"" Mr Lee said. ""Actually, there were a lot of people out."" He is now waiting for indoor dining to start so people can return to Sam Wo, as the hill-top location means outside seating is impossible. He's also ready to open up the first nightclub in the city's Chinatown in more than 40 years, which he hopes will also help revitalise the area.  ""We're the oldest Chinatown in the country. We're the tourist attraction that everybody comes to when they come to San Francisco. So we have to preserve it.""

'Shocking' to see more people in 30s in ICU,"By Susie ForrestScotland health producer, BBC News At the age of 35, Richard Linning, from Falkirk, has found himself fighting for every breath.  Now wearing a high-pressure oxygen mask, he says he is in a state of shock after testing positive for Covid-19 and being admitted to Forth Valley Royal Hospital. ""At the beginning of last week I was perfectly fine and then I got a really sore headache,"" he says. ""For three days I was in pure agony.  ""And then I started struggling to breathe and that's when it started to deteriorate."" A portrait of his 10-year-old son Blair sits beside him in the Covid-19 intensive care bay at the hospital, where he has been since Saturday.  Richard is a bus driver working out of First Bus's Larbert depot, where eight members of staff tested positive last week. ""I don't know how I've picked this up. My work has been really careful in making sure that we've all been safe and I've always followed the rules from day one,"" he says. ""It just shows you how transmissible this virus is."" Older people are more at risk of developing severe disease or dying from coronavirus. But Heather Riddoch, the senior charge nurse here, says they have seen a different profile among some patients in the second wave. ""We're certainly seeing younger patients that are coming in and requiring ventilatory support,"" she says.  ""All ages contract Covid, but we are seeing more people ending up in intensive care in their 30s and 40s in this second wave."" ""I think it's more shocking to see younger people coming in. We've got patients in who are close to our age and younger.  ""A lot of young nurses here are seeing patients who are the same age as their parents, and more families in the ward all at the one time as well.  ""There's a definite shift there and it's shocking and it's more real because it could be you."" This means the increased protection of vaccination for the over-70s won't immediately relieve all the pressure on the NHS. Numbers in hospital and ICU are gradually falling across the country, and are now back below the peak seen in April. But that's not the case everywhere, and here in Forth Valley Royal, clinicians are worried they're starting to see the worst of this wave. Heather says that earlier in the week things had started to get quieter.  ""We really felt things had taken a good turn. However, in the last 48 hours we have doubled the number of patients admitted with Covid and it's been quite shocking at how quickly that rapid turnover has happened.  ""We have actually had to open up another ward and it's a massive change from the beginning of the week."" Dr Fiona McIlveney, who is the clinical lead for intensive care, says the hospital may be feeling the impact of recent outbreaks in Falkirk and Clackmannanshire, which have put local infection rates among the highest in Scotland. ""I think we are probably a bit different from the rest of the country in that we are still seeing a rise in our Covid numbers in the hospital and in intensive care, she says. ""I think there is always going to be regional variation. It's not entirely clear why, but for us we are just starting to see this peak of activity now and this will be our focus for the next few weeks. ""Staff have done a phenomenal job for almost a year now. They've had to run their own lives outside of here, they've had the same challenges about home schooling, and worries about illness and family concerns, but every day they've squared their shoulders and come in here, and they have given their absolute all.  ""I'm so proud of the way they have delivered excellent compassion and care to patients and their families."" Unlike some other health boards, at Forth Valley Royal they have managed to continue with much of their scheduled non-coronavirus care. Just next door to the 10-bed Covid ICU, there's another unit where staff are caring for patients with heart problems, kidney failure, and the aftermath of drug overdoses.  They also look after patients who were previously in the Covid ward, but have now tested negative.  The Scottish government recognises that many patients are spending longer periods of time in intensive care. The most recent figures showed 28 coronavirus patients had been in ICU for longer than 28 days. Dr McIlveney says the effects of long stays don't stop when patients leave the doors of the unit.  ""I think our surviving patients can spend up to 60 or 70 days in here before they leave intensive care, and then that leads them still to a long period of rehabilitation,"" she says. ""The effects of that persist for some time and some people will never be the same again."" Richard warns that some people still need to realise how serious the disease can be for younger adults. ""I mean this hand on heart, on my wee boy's life, you really need to wake up and take this seriously,"" he says. ""This is no joke, I wouldn't be wearing this mask for publicity. This is genuine, this is real."" Do you have a question about the Covid restrictions in place in Scotland? Use the form below to send us your questions and we could be in touch.

Hotel quarantine site taken down after launch,"A new booking system for England's hotel quarantine scheme was taken offline minutes after it launched. The portal, set up as part of efforts to control new Covid variants entering the country, is ""undergoing work to correct a minor technical issue"". The Department of Health said the portal would be open ""well before"" the scheme comes into effect on Monday.  Officials are expecting to have the website back up and running by 10:00 GMT on Friday, the BBC has been told.  The requirement to quarantine in a hotel applies to British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from 33 countries from Monday and will cost Â£1,750 for an individual booking. The so-called ""red list"" countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - are deemed high risk due to emerging new virus variants. In Scotland, residents arriving from any country by air will have to isolate in hotels. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants the UK to follow Scotland and extend the rules to cover all international travellers, saying the borders will be ""too leaky"" otherwise. The website had been accessible for some users intermittently since it was launched just after 13:00 GMT. The most recent holding message promised the site would be ""back soon"" and apologised for the inconvenience as it carried out ""maintenance"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said ministers ""must act to fix this urgently"". ""It is extremely worrying that even the limited hotel quarantine booking system is showing signs of failing from the outset,"" he said. A Department of Health spokesman said: ""Rooms are available from Monday 15 February and the portal will be open well before the go live date."" Around 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from those countries at the moment, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. The Department of Health has arranged for about 4,700 rooms across 16 hotels to be available for the new quarantine system. Travellers have to book a place in quarantine - which lasts 10 days - before arriving in the UK. International travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. The cost of the hotel quarantine packages is Â£1,750 per adult for 11 nights, which includes transport and testing.  For extra adults or a child over 12 the cost is Â£650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is Â£325. In Scotland, the cost is the same for one adult - Â£1,750 - but the government is still working through the costs for extra travellers. The Scottish government is also launching a fund for people who cannot afford the charge. Airlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said. Failing to quarantine in a designated hotel when required will carry a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Giving false travel history information on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK will attract a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. All arrivals from countries not on the ""red list"" must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay Â£210 for two additional private virus tests, booked prior to arrival. It came as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead this year. Mr Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Sir Keir urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February.

Vaccine supply to drop as four centres halt jabs,"The number of vaccines supplied to Wales is expected to fall in the next few weeks, affecting some of the country's vaccination centres. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board says it is pausing vaccinations at four centres for a fortnight. Local politicians say it is because of a fall in the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Other vaccinations centres are expected to reduce their hours. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the drop in supply had been planned for. The Welsh Government said the reduction in supply would affect the whole of the UK. It comes after Wales became the first UK nation on Wednesday to have given first doses to 20% of the population, after a slow start. The government said it was on course to meet its mid-February target of offering a jab to the over 70s, health care workers and the clinically extremely vulnerable. But officials are expecting fewer doses of the AstraZeneca jab - which has been mostly delivered in GP surgeries rather than vaccination centres - before deliveries return to recent levels from the beginning of March. Health boards will determine how vaccines are delivered over the next two weeks, with mass vaccination centres changing their opening times to reflect the reduction in supply. Health officials however, say they have sufficient stocks of Pfizer vaccine to significantly increase the number of second doses next week, as those who had a first dose in December are now due for their next injection. Mr Drakeford told a Welsh Parliament committee: ""We know that we are going to get less vaccine over the next few weeks than we have over the past few weeks."" ""That was planned for and known for and is accommodated in our plans which remain to complete the vaccination of those next five priority groups by the spring.  ""So, without unforeseen barriers, we are confident that we will remain on track."" He said plans remain in place to complete vaccinations of the next five priority groups by the spring. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh NHS ""will be focusing our Pfizer vaccine supply on the second vaccination of those people in the top four priority groups who have already had their first vaccine"".   ""We will be deploying the Astra Zeneca vaccine for first shots for people in the next five groups,"" he said. ""We will hear, I'm afraid, from people disappointed that the amount of supply they're getting is less than we've had over the last couple of weeks because we could use more.  ""If there was more, we could use it, there's no doubt about that."" The vaccination programme will soon be targeting groups further down the priority list - with jabs due to be given to people over the age of 65 and people with underlying health conditions. Health officials say the next two weeks' reduction in supply is planned for - allowing manufacturers to ramp up their production processes, which will lead to significant increases in vaccines from the start of March.  Wales is looking to deliver 103,000 more doses next week - 56,000 Astra-Zeneca vaccines will be mainly first doses and 46,000 Pfizer which will be to push on with second doses for those in the priority groups.  Another 108,000 doses would be given out the following week but then numbers would rise to 160,000 to 190,000 and accelerating. Last Sunday, Cwm Taf Morgannwg was the best performing of all health boards in giving doses to its 70 to 74-year-olds, according to Public Health Wales figures. The health board's executive director Clare Williams, said the switch to the next phase of vaccination will allow a ""pause"" from 16 February ""for two weeks at our four community vaccination centres in Merthyr Tydfil, Abercynon, Rhondda and Bridgend"". Vaccination of health and social care workers, and those aged 70-74, is now ""nearly complete,"" she said. ""It has always been our intention to bring vaccines as close to where people live as we possibly can.  Therefore, during this two-week pause, we will be looking at the locations of all four of our community vaccination centres (CVCs) to ensure they are in the best locations for residents."" The board hopes to expand to seven CVCs, with new centres at Aberfan Leisure Centre, Llantrisant Leisure Centre and Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls in Mountain Ash, and Maesteg Leisure Centre. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Transparency is key in maintaining public trust. Everyone involved in the vaccine rollout has done a fantastic job in vaccinating 20% of the Welsh population, but we need to see the flow of vaccines into the four UK nations, to have confidence that we are getting our fair share."" Welsh Conservative MS Angela Burns said:  ""The Conservative UK Government - which is procuring the supplies - is confident that the steady stream of doses will continue, and this underlines the benefit of being in a strong United Kingdom that works for Wales."" Huw Thomas, BBC Wales correspondent The Welsh NHS has planned for reduced supplies over the coming weeks, as have health officials in other parts of the UK. As a result, the news that some vaccine centres will close temporarily is no surprise to the people manning them.  It also comes as Wales appears to have reached its milestone of offering a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. No appointments should be cancelled as a result of the lower doses reaching Wales, and it is not expected to impact the longer-term plan to offer a dose to the top nine priority groups by the spring. From next week the vaccine statistics will also reflect the increasing numbers of second doses being administered in Wales, as those who were among the first to be vaccinated in the weeks before Christmas are now due to begin receiving their second dose. Stocks of the Pfizer vaccine will be prioritised for second doses in the coming weeks, ensuring nobody faces a delay in receiving their full immunisation. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have factored this into our plans and it will not affect people's appointments or delay when people are due to get their second dose. ""The supply of vaccines is expected to ramp up significantly from the beginning of March.  ""Every dose of vaccine we receive will continue to be delivered immediately to all those who need it. Our vaccination teams continue to do an incredible job to vaccinate everyone as quickly as possible."" The UK government spokesman said: ""We are confident that the steady, regular supply of doses will continue to support the vaccine rollout in the weeks ahead.  ""If you get called for a vaccine, please continue go to your appointment."" Can Wales meet its Covid-19 vaccine targets?

'Six in 10' Covid deaths involved disabled people,"Nearly six out of every 10 people who died with coronavirus in England last year were disabled, figures suggest. Some 30,296 of the 50,888 deaths between January and November were people with a disability, Office for National Statistics (ONS) data shows. It also suggests the risk of death is three times greater for more severely disabled people. Charities have called for urgent government action, describing the data as ""horrifying and tragic"".  The ONS figures suggest disabled people were disproportionately affected by the pandemic - accounting for 17.2% of the study population but nearly 60% of coronavirus deaths. Among women, the risk of death involving coronavirus was 3.5 times greater for more-disabled women - defined as having their day-to-day activities ""limited a lot"" by their health - compared with non-disabled women. For less-disabled women, defined as having their day-to-day activities ""limited a little"", the risk was two times greater. Compared to non-disabled men, the data showed that the risk was 3.1 times greater for more-disabled men, and 1.9 times greater for less-disabled men. Looking at people with a medically diagnosed learning disability, the risk of death involving Covid was 3.7 times greater for both men and women compared with people who did not have a learning disability. The ONS said an ""important part"" of the increased risk was because disabled people were ""disproportionately exposed to a range of generally disadvantageous circumstances"" compared with non-disabled people. James Taylor, from disability equality charity Scope, said disabled people had been ""hardest hit"" by the pandemic and there was ""an urgent need for the government to act"". ""Behind these horrifying and tragic figures are individual stories of disabled people whose lives have been cruelly cut short by coronavirus."" Richard Kramer, chief executive of national disability charity Sense, said that throughout the pandemic disabled people had ""largely been forgotten, left without sufficient support, information and communication"". ""The government must act now, planning its way out of lockdown with disabled people and their family's needs prioritised, to show that it's learnt from the mistakes of the past year.""

Rapid Covid-19 asymptomatic testing rolled out,"Rapid asymptomatic testing sites are being set up in areas of Norfolk where coronavirus is more prevalent. Symptom-free residents can get a test in King's Lynn, Hunstanton, north Great Yarmouth, Caister, Hemsby and Scratby next week, the county council said. Sites in south Norfolk and Norwich would follow, it added. Director of public health Dr Louise Smith said two recent pilots in Norfolk revealed six asymptomatic cases - equivalent to 0.2% of tests. ""One in three people with coronavirus have no symptoms, which means they can be spreading the virus without knowing,"" she added. ""These rapid tests help us to find these people so that we can break the train of transmission."" Having been piloted in King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth, the testing will now be rolled out to other districts where the virus is most widespread. ""The aim is to identify those who might be carrying and spreading the virus without knowing it, so that we can help reduce the spread,"" said Dr Smith. Rapid-turnaround lateral flow tests provide results within 30 minutes. Further symptom-free testing sites will open across the county in the coming weeks and will be targeted at areas where the virus is spreading or where there is greater risk of transmission, the county council said. Meanwhile, there were 1,760 cases in the week up to 6 February, 718 fewer than the preview week. The infection rate in Norfolk as a whole is 194 cases per 100,000 people, down from 273 in the week up to 30 January. All districts in Norfolk saw a drop in cases. The number of Covid patients in hospital as of 9 February was 461, a reduction of 115 since 2 February.  For a more detailed look at coronavirus where you live, use the BBC's postcode checker:

'Too early' to decide on summer holidays - Hancock,"It is ""too early"" to know whether summer holidays can go ahead, the health secretary has said. Matt Hancock said there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"" but ministers were doing everything possible to make sure people could have a holiday this year. He told the BBC he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to ""get rid of the mixed messages"" about whether people should book holidays for later in the year. Some Tory MPs and businesses also criticised the government for fuelling uncertainty for travel companies already struggling in the pandemic. It follows confusion after Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned ""people shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally"". Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson would unveil a roadmap for easing restrictions - potentially including travel - in the week beginning 22 February. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake For most announcements from the government, a day here or there might not make much difference.  But nobody wants to wait any longer than necessary for the promised ""roadmap"" to take England out of lockdown.  So when the prime minister promised that ""on 22 February"" he would reveal that plan, Conservative MPs were among those marking their diaries.  But now Downing Street has said the roadmap will come ""on the week of the 22nd"" - which isn't quite the same.  In response, Tory backbenchers are warning the government not to ""backslide"" on its promise.  They want to hold ministers to their aim of giving schools two weeks' notice before re-opening to all pupils on 8 March.  A vocal minority of Conservative MPs have argued the current lockdown is too strict and needs to lift as soon as possible.  Others have been more patient and kept faith the government will take the right decisions at the right time.  But the further cases fall, the more people get the vaccine and the longer time goes on, the more pressure on the government will grow.  Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast it was too early to know which coronavirus restrictions may still be in place over the summer, but that he understood people wanted to make plans. ""People are yearning for certainty over whether they can have a summer holiday"", he said, but ""pandemics are difficult times and there is a lot of uncertainty"". ""We are doing everything that we possibly can to make sure that people can have a holiday this summer but the vaccine rollout is absolutely essential to that,"" he continued. The health secretary also said that, before summer holidays, the priority would be making sure people can see loved ones again - but it was too early to say when this might happen. The latest government figures show a total of 13,509,108 people have now received the first dose of a vaccine in the UK - a rise of 450,810 from Wednesday. The UK also reported another 678 people had died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, along with a further 13,494 new daily cases. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said cases needed to fall below 10,000 a day before the UK should consider easing lockdown measures, with transmission rates still ""incredibly high"".  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it ""doesn't make any sense"" to set out plans to ease restrictions with arbitrary dates in March or April, adding that ""the data has to drive us"". ""In 2020 we lifted restrictions too quickly... as a result the transmission went back up in this country,"" he said. Dawn Dillon, from Surrey, says her husband booked a holiday to Spain in June 2019 for the following year as her birthday present. They were able to move the trip, which cost Â£1,000 for accommodation and flights, from 2020 to June 2021. ""But what do we do now - will we lose our holiday?"" she asks.  ""I know it's not a priority but it would be nice to have some clarity."" Dawn, who is 55 and asthmatic, says she had anticipated that she would have had a Covid vaccine, along with her husband, before the trip in June. ""But you don't know how advanced the vaccination process is in other countries,"" she adds. Mr Johnson told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday that as far as holidays were concerned, people would have to be a ""little bit more patient"". The PM's official spokesman said Mr Johnson does not have a holiday planned but ""is obviously keen to have a break over the summer"". But Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth criticised ministers for not being clearer about what the public could plan for. He said he had yet to book a holiday because he was ""in the same boat as everyone else"". Sir Keir said he had a ""holding"" booking for a break in Devon in August that is ""subject to restrictions, that's the best anybody can do"". Senior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker accused ministers of ""ripping out"" the goalposts on the timetable for lifting Covid restrictions. People ""need to have something to look forward to"", he said. One travel industry leader criticised the government's plea for people to stop making summer plans as ""puerile and nonsensical"". And Heathrow Airport's chief executive said getting back to normality was not just about people's holidays but also to ""protect people's businesses and livelihood"". Meanwhile, Henry Joce, of Tencreek Holiday Park and Campsite in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5 Live it may be too late, not too soon, to book a spot there over certain dates this summer.  He said soaring demand for breaks over the past fortnight meant he was at risk of selling out during peak weeks, which he put down to people ""being desperate to get away"". Under the current national restrictions, holidays are not permitted anywhere in the UK. International travel is restricted to essential purposes, such as for work, medical appointments, or education. A new online portal allowing UK and Irish nationals and residents travelling from certain ""red list"" countries to book a place in hotel quarantine had technical issues as it launched on Thursday. From Monday, arrivals from 33 nations deemed high-risk due to new virus variants must isolate for 10 days in managed facilities at a cost of at least Â£1,750.  All other arrivals must see out a 10-day quarantine at home, but will be required to pay Â£210 for two additional private virus tests booked prior to arrival.

South Africa variant found in Stafford area,"The Covid-19 variant identified in South Africa has been found in the Stafford area.  One resident, with no links to international travel, tested positive in January and it was picked up in lab screening, the county council said. Contact tracing suggests they had no known contact with people in their local area while infectious. The council is calling on everyone in the Stafford borough area to get tested in the next four weeks.  Dr Nic Coetzee, from Public Health England Midlands, said with new variants ""emerging all the time and spreading more rapidly"", it was ""not surprising"" a South African variant case had been found in the county.  ""While there is currently no evidence of the South African variant circulating in the community, we want to be proactive in testing people and stopping the spreading of infection,"" he added. Staffordshire County Council has asked anyone ""out and about during lockdown"" to get tested at least weekly. Dr Richard Harling, director of health and care, said any positive tests would be routinely screened for the South Africa variant.  Those without symptoms are asked to book into one of the community testing centres across the county. Walk-in tests are available or people can book in advance. Those with symptoms should book a test at the Beaconside drive-through site.

Looking after your mental health in a pandemic,"The pandemic has brought grief, financial hardship and loneliness for many people, and looking after our mental health is now more important than ever. We have been covering the hidden impact of Covid-19 - from anxiety and depression, to stress and loneliness - since the beginning of the pandemic, and some of our best pieces are below. The BBC has also just launched a new platform, called Headroom, to help with people's mental health during this time. How has coronavirus affected mental health?: Mental health problems have got worse across all age-groups in the past year.

English councils get emergency government funding,"Four councils in England are being given emergency funding because they are unable to balance their books. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the pandemic was responsible in some cases, but in others ""very poor management"" was to blame.  Eastbourne, Bexley, Luton and Peterborough will get more flexibility to borrow money from the government. It comes as some local authorities are warning of financial ruin amidst pressure from Covid-19. Councils' core spending power is due to rise by up to Â£2.3bn next year, but some councils are still warning of shortfalls amid hits to income.  BBC analysis in 2020 revealed the scale of the problems facing them, with nearly 150 forecasting a combined budget shortfall of at least Â£3.2bn.  Some of the largest UK councils have been warning that they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support. The government had previously provided almost Â£5bn in emergency support since the start of the pandemic to help councils deal with spiralling costs.  The four councils have been granted ""capitalisation directions"" allowing them to borrow money from the government to cover day-to-day costs.  Normally, councils can only borrow money for investments or capital projects such as building work. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Jenrick said there was ""quite a broad range"" of reasons why additional taxpayer support was required. He said with some this was due to ""poor management,"" and others due to ""the exceptional events of the past year"". He added that the funding had been granted on an ""exceptional basis"" and the councils would be subject to ""rigorous reviews"" of their finances.  ""Taxpayer support of this kind is never provided lightly, and in return for the increased flexibility afforded to councils next year, we expect sound financial management with residents shielded from unaffordable increases.""  Mr Jenrick also announced a Â£50,000 fund for the Isle of Wight fund to review the challenges face by the council, residents and businesses on the island in terms of access to vital services, supplies and employment. Liberal Democrat deputy leader of Eastbourne council Stephen Holt said they had made Â£4m in savings this year, but had been hit hard by reduced tourism during the pandemic. He told the BBC the sector - including theatres and conference venues - normally represented about 60% of the council's annual income.  He added they had originally asked the government for help in the form of a grant, but noted they had received a loan, which ""will need to be repaid"".  Labour says council budgets have been ""stretched to breaking point"".  Shadow secretary of state for communities, Steve Reed, warned news of the bailout was the tip of the iceberg and council finances had ""finally burst"". He added: ""Ministers broke their promise to give councils the funding they needed to get communities through the crisis. ""The government's refusal to fund services properly means a dozen councils are already in talks to avoid bankruptcy and sadly dozens more are close to that point."" Local authorities are required by law to have a balanced budget.  There are three ways those facing difficulty could do this:",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56018438,1
Tutor died after Covid concerns raised at college,"A college union has said it is ""angry and devastated"" that a tutor died with coronavirus after it raised health and safety concerns about her workplace.  Donna Coleman, 42, who worked with vulnerable students at Burnley College, died last month. The University and College Union (UCU) said it had previously rejected the college's risk assessments because it had ""poor Covid controls"".   The BBC has approached Burnley College for comment.  Ms Coleman tested positive for coronavirus shortly before Christmas and died on 6 January.  Stephanie Coleman said her sister was fearful of returning to work in September.  She said Ms Coleman ""was scared but she wanted to go in and be with the students and do her job"". Paying tribute to her sister, Stephanie said she was ""amazing"" and had a ""real cheeky side"" to her and ""lived for her family and friends"". ""She was fun, she would get up on karaoke and thought she was Whitney. She had the biggest smile, bright pink lipstick and she gave the best hugs ever,"" she said. UCU said it was investigating the circumstances leading up to Ms Coleman's death and whether she contracted Covid through her work at the college. Regional official Martyn Moss said her death was an ""appalling tragedy"". He said the college was refusing to disclose ""whether it knows if it had any Covid outbreaks"". Mr Moss said the UCU had ""raised our health and safety concerns with the college and with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE)"".   The HSE said it had ""been working with the college regarding Covid measures on campus and safety with regard to events such as open evenings"". ""We will now be liaising further with the college in relation to this fatality and will make further inquiries,"" a spokesman said. Ms Coleman's sister said it made her angry when people ""walk around with their masks half way down their faces"" because she did not want others to go through what her family had. ""It breaks my heart, there is a void there,"" she said. Why not follow BBC North West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram?

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  The number of people waiting more than 12 months to start hospital treatment in England was 224,205 in December, NHS figures show. It's the highest for any calendar month since April 2008, and compares with 1,467 in December 2019. It comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the health service ""remains under significant pressure"" and staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic. A drug normally used to treat arthritis can be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patients with Covid, according to new research. For every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, experts have said. Some hospitals are now doing this. As well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, said NHS doctors. A clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers was carried out and researchers say the results are a ""tremendous step forwards"". More than one million people have had their first dose of the Covid jab in Scotland so far. But Nicola Sturgeon has warned that the country's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems. The first minister said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon insisted Scotland is still on track to hit its targets. It wasn't a great start for travellers wanting to book their rooms in hotels being used as part of the UK's quarantine scheme. The new system for securing a place was taken offline minutes after it launched. The portal, set up as part of efforts to control new Covid variants entering the UK, was removed temporarily for maintenance ""to correct a minor technical error"". It said rooms were available ""and travellers will be able to book through the site imminently"". From Monday, British and Irish citizens, and UK residents arriving in England from 33 ""red-list"" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, at a cost of Â£1,750 for one adult. A mother and daughter have joined nursing courses at the same university after they both decided they wanted to help on the front line as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Tracy Alexander, 49, chose to specialise in child nursing, while her daughter Sarah, 22, has pursued adult nursing at Liverpool John Moores University. They are both in their first year and began their studies in September. Sarah said it was ""nice to have someone who understands"" when she comes home after a day of lessons.

Stormont to act 'collectively' in lockdown review,"Stormont ministers will take a ""collective approach"" when reviewing NI's lockdown restrictions next week, Conor Murphy has said. NI re-entered lockdown on 26 December, with the measures due to last until 5 March. But ministers will meet on Thursday to review what should happen beyond that point. First Minister Arlene Foster said there needed to be one more ""push"" to reduce infection rates as much as possible. Next Thursday's executive meeting would be a ""key decision point"" about how Northern Ireland emerges from lockdown, she said. A pathway to recovery document is due to be published by the executive in the coming weeks, with many businesses asking for clarity around indicative reopening dates. It comes as Stormont's health minister warned there are concerns that Northern Ireland's Covid-19 transmission rate has stagnated. The R - or reproduction - number was estimated between 1.5 to 1.9 at the start of January, but has fallen to below one. Speaking at the executive's press briefing on Thursday, Mrs Foster said she recognised that people wanted to see an end to restrictions, but warned: ""We need to see numbers as low as possible so we can plan for gradually emerging from lockdown."" She said Northern Ireland's R number is currently sitting at 0.75 to 0.85 and that it was right to remain hopeful for ""better days ahead"". ""We must approach with care so we don't lose the gains we have made, the clear message has been about saving lives and easing pressure."" Nine more coronavirus-related deaths were reported on Thursday, along with 253 new cases. According to Department of Health figures, 1,966 people have now died in Northern Ireland after testing positive for Covid-19. There are 518 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland. Some 58 are in intensive care units (ICU), 57 of which are ventilated - a drop of four from the previous day. In the Republic of Ireland a further 52 deaths have been recorded, bringing its total to 3,846. A further 866 confirmed cases of the virus have also been reported. At the executive meeting on Thursday, the first minister also said it had considered the issue of international travel. ""I do regret it's not a four and five-nation approach,"" she said. She added that the executive would consider the use of quarantine hotels for passengers from so-called red list countries, if and when international flights begin in NI again. Mr Murphy said his party had been arguing for an all-island approach throughout the pandemic, and said there were ""international lessons"" about how to manage travel. ""I want to see as much of a joined-up approach as we can possibly manage."" Meanwhile, the Department of Health has said 353,757 people have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine in Northern Ireland. By Leslie-Anne McKeown, BBC News NI health producer Verbal abuse is being levelled at vaccine call centre staff, the Department of Health has warned. Patricia Donnelly, who heads up the vaccination programme in Northern Ireland, said there have also been issues with double-booking and no-shows at vaccine centres. She said: ""Unfortunately, there have been some instances of people who are not eligible for the jab phoning up to try to get an appointment.  ""Some become abusive when they are informed that they cannot book. This is unacceptable behaviour and it must stop."" Ms Donnelly said there were concerns that abuse of the booking system was making it more difficult for people who are eligible to get through. She added: ""We are also seeing cases of some people double booking - by telephone and online. This is taking appointments from others. ""Please turn up when you have made an appointment. Please don't phone up if you are not eligible - you won't get a booking. And please be courteous to staff on the telephone lines. ""I fully understand people are anxious to get the protection that the vaccines offer. Let me assure everyone that we are rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as we can. While it is not a race, I believe our progress to date would be the envy of many other countries. ""Our rate of progress is limited by the availability of supplies. Further vaccine supplies will come and you will get your jab. Please be patient."" Meanwhile, the department has appealed for people aged between 65 and 69-years-old to get their vaccine after demand has slowed since after an initial surge in demand when slots were made available for that age group late last month. On Thursday, Mr Swann told Stormont's health committee that the drop in the R number had ""undoubtedly saved lives"". ""We always need a period of time when R is as low as possible - to more quickly break those chains of infection which are resulting in people becoming sick and hospitalised and losing their lives,"" he said. ""Our health and social care needs time to deliver other care and that has been delayed or disrupted by the epidemic,"" he added. He also discussed the issue of new variants of the virus and said the Kent variant now accounts for 40-60% of new cases in Northern Ireland. He was also asked about what changes are being made to the Covid-19 strategy to avoid more cycles of lockdown and lifting of restrictions. He said a lot had been learned from the first wave of the pandemic, and they have ""massively up-scaled"" the test, trace and protect (TTP) programme. He said the average contact time is now six-and-a-half hours after a positive case. At the peak of this wave in January, 12,000 cases were referred to TTP and contact success was 93.5%, he said. Since January, there has been an increase in the average number of contacts from one to two-and-a-half people despite the current restrictions in place, he added. Mr Swann also said testing is being rolled out elsewhere - in workplaces, special schools, meat factories, Translink - and waste water was also being tested.

Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening,"By Nicola Bryan & Caleb SpencerBBC News Schools in Wrexham will delay opening classes to children aged three to seven due to concerns over coronavirus rates. Foundation phase pupils are due to start a phased return to school from the Monday after half term.  Wrexham still has the highest rate of Covid infections in Wales, and will not be sending children back until Friday, 26 February. Anglesey, Denbighshire and Gwynedd are also delaying the immediate return of younger pupils. The Welsh Government announced last week that primary schools would begin the process of reopening for the first time since Christmas on 22 February. Wrexham council said: ""Although coronavirus levels are falling in Wrexham, the figures are still very high, so the council and headteachers are carefully considering plans, while continually monitoring the local situation. ""In light of this cautious approach, children will not be returning to schools in Wrexham until Friday, 26 February at the very earliest - depending on local coronavirus levels after half-term."" Wrexham and Flintshire still have six of the 10 highest localised rates in Wales, when they are broken down by community - or what are known as middle layer super output areas (MSOAs). Although these case rates too have dropped back in recent weeks. The highest in Wrexham - Wrexham West - has seen 35 actual positive tests over the last week. There are local hotspots too in Holywell and Bagillt and part of Connah's Quay in Flintshire Flintshire council, which currently has the second highest case rate in Wales, said it would review a decision to reopen schools on 22 February ""should the public health situation become a cause for concern"". Schools on Anglesey, which has the third highest rate of coronavirus infections in Wales, said it would also be delaying pupils returning, phased from Thursday, 25 February. ""Our aim is that all foundation phase pupils are back in their classrooms by Wednesday, 3 March at the latest,"" Anglesey officials said. Meanwhile Denbighshire said its primary schools would reopen to foundation phase pupils from Wednesday, 24 February, as long as ""all necessary safety measures"" are in place.  In Gwynedd, the council has confirmed the Monday and Tuesday of that week will see schools remain closed for staff to prepare for pupils' return. ""Gwynedd's Education Authority has met with head teachers this week to ensure they are fully aware of the latest development and our officers continue to offer help and advice regarding the planned phased opening for foundation phase pupils during the week beginning 22 February,"" a spokesman said. Free school meals and school transport will be available for all eligible pupils when those schools reopen, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Children classed as vulnerable and those of critical workers have been able to remain in school during lockdown. No timetable has yet been given for the return of other children. In an open letter to headteachers, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the Welsh Government had ""always said"" schools should be ""last to close and first to open"" when safe to do so. She said ""much lower"" rates of transmission of Covid-19 and advice from its Technical Advisory Group had allowed the ""partial and phased return to face-to-face learning in schools"". Ms Williams explainedÂ there would be some flexibility to the arrangement over the first week, but with all foundation pupils in school by the end of the week. Any further phased return for other year groups will be considered as part of the next 21 day review on 19 February. The Welsh Government has also issued detailed guidance on the return to classes, with teachers told they will be expected to face masks in some circumstances.

Bristol Covid-19 variant 'may re-infect people',"A new coronavirus variant found in Bristol may be able to infect people who have already had Covid-19 or who have been vaccinated. But experts said jabs will still protect against people becoming seriously ill with the disease. The Bristol variant contains the E484K mutation also found in the South African and Brazilian variants. Health officials in the city say getting as many people vaccinated as possible is key. The Bristol variant has been defined by the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) as the Kent variant with the E484K mutation. Laboratory studies have shown that viruses with that mutation are able to escape human defences, making them more efficient at evading natural and vaccine-triggered immunity. As of Tuesday the Public Health England (PHE) said it had identified 21 cases of the Bristol variant. Group leader of the Retrovirus-Host Interactions Laboratory at the Francis Crick Institute, Dr Jonathan Stoye said data showed the E484K mutation ""may reduce"" peoples' immune response to Covid-19. ""It is this change that makes the South African variant that we've heard so much about such a danger,"" he said. ""We hear a lot about trying to keep the South African variants out but what appears to be happening in Bristol and Liverpool is that the same mutation is occurring which might give these viruses the same properties as the viruses that we were trying to keep out."" More than 15,000 people have come forward for surge testing across 24 postcodes in the city and parts of South Gloucestershire as part of Operation Eagle. Gloucestershire's public health chief Sarah Scott said no cases of the new Bristol variant had been found in the county but added authorities were ""keeping a careful eye on the situation"". Latest figures from Public Health England show in the week beginning 6 Feb there were 184 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in Bristol and 106 in Gloucestershire. University of Bristol virologist Dr David Matthews said above all vaccines should still be able to prevent people being hospitalised with Covid-19. ""As far as we can tell, none of the viruses that are emerging can do the thing that you dread - which is that it can both evade the vaccine and still put people in hospital - because that's really the only thing we need to worry about."" Clinical lead for Bristol's vaccination programme, Dr Tim Whittlestone believes the vaccines being used in the UK are currently effective against ""all the variants out there"". ""The degree of effectiveness may vary according to the various variants of concern,"" he said. ""The overwhelming evidence is that the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your family is to get vaccinated."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Some MoT exemptions extended by four months,"MoT exemptions have been extended for some vehicle groups in Northern Ireland for a further four months. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said she wants to ensure ""customers can legally keep their vehicles on the road for their essential journeys"". MoT tests were suspended in January last year after faults were detected in some of the lifts.  Testing has been further disrupted by the pandemic. The DVA (Driver and Vehicle Agency) issued temporary exemption certificates (TECs) so motorists could stay on the road. The tests have also been going ahead but with a reduced testing capacity. The four-month extension applies to private cars, light goods vehicles and motorcycles aged four to nine years that have already received a TEC. Vehicles due a first-time test will have a four-month TEC applied from the date their first MoT is due.  The extension will apply from 26 March. Ms Mallon said she wanted to ""remind owners and drivers of all vehicles that they are responsible under the law for the roadworthiness of their vehicle at all times"". The department said TECs will continue to be applied to all eligible vehicles ""until vehicle testing services return to normal testing capacity"".  ""Testing for older vehicles including all private cars, light goods vehicles and motorcycles that are aged 10 to 39 years old will be brought forward to ensure these vehicles can be tested before their existing TECs expire,"" it added.Â   ""Further TEC extensions will not be applied to these vehicle categories to ensure that any road safety concerns in these older vehicles are tested and rectified through the MoT testing process."" The DVA said car owners will not be sent a hard copy TEC, but that it will be applied automatically on its system. The organisation will then contact the registered keeper of the vehicle before the TEC period ends with instructions on how to book a test.

Murder-accused 'out of control' with Covid worry,"A man who killed his wife days into the first national lockdown was ""spiralling out of control"" with worry over Covid and money, his daughter has said. Anthony Williams, 70, strangled his wife Ruth Williams after a row at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on 28 March. Mr Williams denies murder but admits manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility. Emma Williams told Swansea Crown Court her father became obsessed with Covid. She said her father's personality had changed from being ""a joker"" to fearing ""people would never leave the house again"" after lockdown. She said: ""In recent weeks he always had his head buried into his tablet and wasn't talking much just looking at things about Covid online. ""I said 'dad you need to stop watching the news all the time and worrying about Covid. You're spiralling out of control'."" Ms Williams added that ""two weeks before"" her mother's death, her father said to her he thought he was going to ""lose the house and not be able to pay the bills"". She said: ""Dad said to me: 'Me and your mam are going to have to come and live with you'."" Defending, barrister John Hipkin QC asked Ms Williams about her parents' savings, which she said amounted to Â£148,000. She said despite telling her father ""he was fine with the savings and his and mum's pensions"", he took Mrs Williams to the bank and withdrew ""ten thousand from their savings to put it in their current account, that meant they had Â£18,000 in the current account"".  Mr Hipkin also asked whether Mr Williams became ""obsessed"" with other things, to which Ms Williams said yes and that he ""kept turning off the heating"". She told the court that the last time he was in her house he noticed her gas meter reading and ""must have got up 30 times switching the heating on and off"" because ""he thought it would be too expensive for me"".  She added that her mother had said Mr Williams ""became obsessed with switching off the heating and lights at home too"". Ms Williams told the court: ""The last conversation I had with him he was obsessing about his shoes and how he wouldn't be able to buy new ones because he thought his shoes were falling apart."" She added that her father had ""always been a worrier, but something didn't feel right"". The defendant's daughter also told the court how her dad was losing sleep over health concerns and not eating properly because he feared he had throat cancer and ""kept going back and fore to the GPs"". She said her father had problems swallowing and ""thought he had a lump in his throat"", but doctors were unable to find anything. Psychiatrist Dr Alison Witts, who was also called to give evidence for the defence, described Mr Williams as suffering with anxiety and depression. Dr Witts had three meetings with Mr Williams over a videocall after he was remanded in custody. Dr Witts also said she believed that Mr Williams' mental health had dramatically deteriorated after retiring.  ""Work gave him a structure and depression in over 60s is often not diagnosed and left untreated because they tend to minimise the symptoms and think they should be mentally stronger,"" she said. She told the court that her opinion was ""he was overwhelmed with anxiety at the material moment, which is when he killed Ruth Williams"".  ""He described significant apprehension, a feeling of being very tense, very anxious,"" she added. ""That can lead to a release in stress hormones and adrenalin, and he was overwhelmed psychologically by emotions and anxiety and impaired his ability to exercise self-control."" Dr Witts told the court this was why she recommended diminished responsibility to be considered. The trial continues.

What help can self-employed people get?,"By Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter The government will announced more help for the self-employed in March's budget.  A series of payments - the Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS) - has aimed to protect them during the pandemic, although nearly a fifth has missed out on financial assistance.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak will outline details of a fresh payment to the self-employed in the Budget. This will cover the three-month period from the start of February until the end of April. It's the fourth grant the government has paid out to cover loss of income over the last year,  The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered a loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to a cap of Â£2,500 per month.  It was available to those who had been trading in the financial year 2018-2019, and were planning to continue doing so, but whose business had been hit by coronavirus. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months.  Over the summer a ""second and final"" payment was announced covering 70% of profits, up to a cap of Â£2,190 per month for another three months - Â£6,570 in total. It proved not to be the final payment, but the second of four. The third payment covered 80% of profits for November, December and January, up to a total limit of Â£7,500 - paid in a single instalment. Applications for this grant have now closed. The government's original plan was for this third grant to only cover 40% of average monthly trading profits, with a limit of Â£3,750 in total, but it was extended after stricter restrictions for businesses were introduced. Businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The relatively newly self-employed do not receive any help under this scheme, as more recent tax details are not being considered. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked:  Although many people are covered, there has been a significant campaign, and concerns raised by MPs, over a large number of people who miss out on the support. Research body the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said there was ""clear unfairness"" in some of the exclusions. Self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are not covered by the scheme (although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income are ineligible, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash.  Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education. The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. Why can't some workers get Covid help?

Holiday bookings jump despite 'unclear rules',"By Robert PlummerBusiness reporter, BBC News UK holiday providers are still seeing strong demand for summer getaways amid ""confusing"" warnings that it may be too soon to book because of Covid. Sarah and Steve Jarvis, who run the Independent Cottages website, say inquiries in the first week of February were nearly 100% up on last year. They said they had seen ""no difference"" to the level of interest since the warnings from government ministers. People were showing a ""healthy appetite"" for holidays, Sarah said. But people booking through the site, which lists more than 1,800 properties, were also studying the small print and making sure they knew about cancellation policies. ""Consumers are educated. They know what questions to ask,"" she added. ""Our owners don't want to open up too early, but they've been shut for so long that they really need to see some income,"" Steve said. ""It's quite a desperate situation for some owners. We're seeing some leave the industry because of this."" The government is sending ""a confusing message"" on whether people should book summer breaks, travel industry bosses have told the BBC. Holiday firms are ""on their knees"" and it is ""imperative"" that they can count on a good summer, said Visit East of England chairman Andy Wood. But Cornwall's Eden Project boss David Harland said he felt ""cautious optimism"" despite the uncertainty. ""People have been booking and they should book with confidence,"" he said. The two travel professionals were reacting to a series of statements from government ministers suggesting that it was unclear whether summer holidays could go ahead because of the pandemic. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC there was still ""a lot of uncertainty"", but added that he had booked his own summer break in Cornwall ""months ago"". He was speaking a day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps both said it was ""too early"" to be sure about booking getaways. Hours after Mr Shapps' comments, senior travel industry figure Sue Ockwell, of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO), told the BBC he was being ""puerile and nonsensical"". Visit East of England's Mr Wood echoed the Eden Project chief executive's positive view of demand for summer holidays, saying: ""We're seeing strong bookings and that's really important. ""Being able to count on a good summer is really imperative for businesses, because we don't want them taking decisions to cut jobs. ""The tourism industry's got millions of jobs in it, it's worth about Â£130bn in sales to the UK, so it's a vital sector."" Another holiday provider, holidaycottages.co.uk, also reported that the government's warnings had had no effect on demand. The firm's chief marketing officer, James Starkey, said: ""Whilst the comments from the transport secretary cast doubt over when holidays will be able to take place again, we've seen bookings continue to come in from guests who want something to look forward to. ""Measures such as contactless key collections, enhanced cleaning and independent cottage units mean that booking a cottage should remain one of the safest ways to enjoy a holiday this year."" Holiday booking platform Airbnb has also seen a surge in interest in UK holidays. Domestic searches for British destinations for this summer more than tripled towards the end of last week compared with the first few weeks of January, it said. An Airbnb spokesperson said: ""Britain is looking forward to a brighter summer. Travel is taking on more meaning as we pursue experiences closer to home and look forward to reconnecting with family and loved ones.  ""We have seen an uptick in searches to the great British countryside, to both the traditional favourites and lesser travelled gems, which is great news for hosts in these communities that wouldn't normally benefit.""  And according to tech firm Avvio, which provides online marketing and booking services to hotels, UK hotel and self-catering bookings for August are 46% ahead of last year. Its chief commercial officer, Michael De Jongh, said: ""Everyone is desperate for something to look forward to at the moment, so it makes complete sense that many people are splashing out on a UK holiday.  ""So long as they ensure they can amend or cancel their booking easily, they won't be left financially worse off if lockdown continues longer than anticipated.""

"Questions over '1,400 empty jab appointments'","Questions have been raised why 1,400 vaccination slots at a hub in Telford were left empty. Shaun Davies, leader of Telford and Wrekin Council, said about 100 people got the jab against Covid-19 on Tuesday, despite the Telford International Centre (TIC) having the capacity to deliver 1,500 each day. He also claimed vaccinators were sent home from the site. Health bosses in Shropshire blamed a national booking system. Mr Davies said: ""There has been a significant issue with the booking system and there has also been a hesitancy on behalf of health bosses to be more flexible."" The council leader said there had been a ""perfect storm"" of missed opportunities, while the booking system needed improving. ""When there are gaps, local health teams should be able to make a call out for people to come forward - those slots could have been given to police officers, teachers, a whole range of different workers who could have come at the drop of a hat and got a vaccine if they wanted to,"" he said. Dave Evans, joint accountable officer for the Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), said unlike some venues, the TIC relied on the national booking system, which only allowed people to book if over 70. He said a decision was made on Wednesday to invite over-65s. ""Letters are going out and contact is being made with people who are over 65 so they can book in via another route other than the national booking service,"" he said. A spokesperson for the NHS said the service was on track to offer a vaccine to everyone in the top four priority groups by the middle of February. ""Vaccine centres across the Midlands are prepared to welcome people from the next highest priority groups after that date,"" they said. At the beginning of the vaccination programme, the government laid out the priority groups, starting with care home residents, over-80s and staff working for the NHS or in social care. The latest criticism of the speed of vaccinations among under-70s follows news last month that Shropshire and Telford had the lowest rates of inoculations in England. It has quickly caught up with the priority over-80s group. Latest official figures show more than 96% of that category have had their first dose. However, unlike many other parts of England it had again been slow to vaccinate lower age groups. Up to 4 February, it had comfortably the lowest rate of vaccinations in those aged 75-80 in England and the second lowest of those aged 70-74. The CCG said since then it had again caught up in those categories to such an extent it had ""almost run out"" of people aged over 70 to vaccinate.

UK borders 'too leaky' despite quarantine rules,"UK borders will still be ""too leaky"" despite the introduction of hotel quarantine rules for some international travellers, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said. The UK government's new rules will apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed ""high risk"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock described this as ""the right approach"". But Ms Sturgeon wants the UK government to follow Scotland and extend the rules to cover all international travellers. The new quarantine restrictions will take effect from Monday. People arriving in England from ""red list"" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, costing Â£1,750. However, Scotland's rules will apply to all international travellers. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that passengers arriving in England from ""low risk"" countries would be required to quarantine at home - even if their home was in Scotland - rather than face hotel quarantine at their point of entry.  He said travellers to England would be required to take three tests - one before travel, then further tests two days and eight days after arrival.  Mr Hancock said that policy was the ""right approach"".  ""There are some countries where the risk, because of the number of cases domestically, is very low and we have this robust set of testing arrangements in place,"" he said.  ""If you require a hotel quarantine for people coming from anywhere, then that includes people coming from countries where there aren't any cases or where the cases are significantly lower than they are anywhere in the UK."" Speaking at the Scottish government's coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Scotland's approach was ""more in line with scientific advice"". ""When we are faced with new variants, we don't know which countries they are in because not all countries do really extensive genomic sequencing,"" she said. The first minister said she could only impose restrictions on people arriving directly into Scotland. She said discussions were continuing with the UK government, and that she had raised her concern that ""UK borders as a whole areâ¦ still a bit too leaky to protect properly against importation of this virus and new variants of it. ""We are still trying to persuade the UK government to impose the same kind of restrictions that we are doing, and then that takes away the problem."" Ms Sturgeon added that Scotland could also be ""asking the police to do more than they are doing right now in terms of the checks coming into the country"". ""Nobody wants to be doing this. I want people to be able to travel freely, but this is a public health crisis.""  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has already called for regulations across the UK to be brought in line with Scotland.  Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman, earlier told Good Morning Scotland that the country's policy was based on clinical and public health advice. ""I think it is a fair return for the huge efforts that people across Scotland are making in restricting their own lives in order to bring cases down. ""We, and the UK government, have a responsibility to try and do everything we can to prevent the virus coming in.  ""Remembering this is a global pandemic, we're not here as a wee island entirely on our own. We need to be working globally."" She said border checks between Scotland and England would be considered to prevent the inward transmission of the virus at any of Scotland's port, air and land borders ""without disrupting necessary supply chains"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nicola Steedman said multiple infections coming in from abroad and across the UK ""seeded the pandemic within Scotland"" in the first and second waves.

Ireland may have Level 5 restrictions until Easter,"The Republic of Ireland could see a continuation of high level restrictions to the Easter period, Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin has warned.  Speaking on RTÃ's Morning Ireland, Mr Martin said the government is revising its Living with Covid Plan. He said it made sense to take a cautious approach as the vaccination programme is being rolled out across the country.  On Wednesday, there were 54 additional coronavirus-related deaths reported.  The Republic of Ireland's overall toll of coronavirus-related deaths is 3,794.  The National Public Health Emergency Team also recorded 1,006 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday.   Mr Martin said the week commencing 20 February would bring clarity about the easing of restrictions. Under Level 5 restrictions there is a ban on all household visits, non-essential retail is closed and there is a 5km limit on travel. Only six people can attend a wedding and 10 are allowed at a funeral.  A phased return of pupils to school is to begin on 22 February, RTÃ reported on Wednesday.  Students with special educational needs, attending classes at post-primary schools, will return for in-school teaching. Special classes for children in primary schools are also due to reopen on 22 February, while special schools are due to reopen on Thursday. The taoiseach said the phased return to school means that there will not be a million people on the move at the one time and Leaving Certificate students should know by next week what the situation is regarding exams.  The Irish government hopes to publish legislation next week on quarantine hotels. Mr Martin said 20 other countries, including sub-Saharan Africa and the UAE, will be considered with regard to mandatory quarantining. He also stressed that people should not undertake non-essential international travel, which he said is a breach of Level 5 restrictions.  Meanwhile, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy PM) Leo Varadkar appealed to Sinn FÃ©in's leadership in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) to use its influence with party colleagues in the Northern Ireland Executive to change the rules on travel. Mr Varadkar said Northern Ireland was ""the laggard"" in dealing with mandatory quarantining between the two islands. Mr Varadkar said there was no requirement for a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test within 72 hours, for those travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland, nor any requirements for mandatory home or hotel quarantining. He made his remarks in response to a question from Sinn FÃ©in's Pearse Doherty, who said promised legislation on mandatory international quarantining was moving at ""a snail's pace"". Mr Varadkar said he hoped legislation on the matter would be introduced next week. He added that international travel into Ireland is down by 95% and 98-99% of those have taken the PCR test for Covid-19.

Arthritis drug 'a life-saver' for Covid patients,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A drug normally used to treat arthritis can be a life-saver for some of the sickest hospital patients with Covid, new research shows. For every 25 patients treated with tocilizumab, along with a cheap steroid already routinely given, an additional life would be saved, the experts say. Some hospitals are now doing this.  As well as improving survival and recovery time, it can avoid patients needing to be moved to intensive care, say the NHS doctors. Wendy Coleman, 62, received the treatment last year when she was admitted to Chesterfield Royal Hospital with severe Covid-19. ""I was struggling to breathe quite badly and on the verge of being placed in an intensive care unit.  ""After I was given tocilizumab, my condition stabilised and I didn't get any worse. Up until then, it was quite scary as I didn't know if I was going to make it or not,"" she said.  Researchers say around half of people admitted to hospital with Covid could benefit from the treatment.  They have carried out a clinical trial with more than 4,000 volunteers, like Wendy, and say the results are ""tremendous"".  Half of these Covid patients were given tocilizumab, via a drip, alongside usual care with a life-saving cheap steroid drug called dexamethasone.  In that group, compared to another group that did not receive the new drug:  Combined, tocilizumab and dexamethasone should cut death risk by about a third for patients on oxygen and halve it for those on a ventilator, the researchers say.  Prof Martin Landray, joint chief investigator of the RECOVERY trial and a medical expert at Oxford University, said: ""Used in combination, the impact is substantial. This is good news for patients and good news for the health services that care for them in the UK and around the world.""  Dr Charlotte Summers, an intensive care medic at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, said: ""These findings are a tremendous step forwards. This therapy looks like it keeps people out of the intensive care unit so they never need to see people like me which can only be a good thing."" The treatment isn't cheap, costing around Â£500 per patient on top of the Â£5 course of dexamethasone. But the advantage of using it is clear - and less than the cost per day of an intensive care bed of around Â£2,000. The drugs dampen down inflammation, which can go into overdrive in Covid patients and cause damage to the lungs and other organs. The preliminary trial results will soon be submitted to a peer-reviewed medical journal.  Health and Social Care Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are working quickly and closely with colleagues across the health system and sector to ensure every NHS patient who needs this treatment should be able to access it - reducing further pressures on the NHS and potentially saving thousands of lives."" NHS national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said it was another breakthrough in the fight against coronavirus.

Plans for huge Charles de Gaulle terminal scrapped,"The French government has abandoned plans to build a huge new terminal at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. The coronavirus pandemic and changing environmental priorities were the reasons given for the move. A fourth terminal would have allowed the airport to handle up to 40 million extra passengers a year. France has radically changed its transport priorities, with airport developments now requiring plans for electric or hydrogen-fuelled planes.  Ecology Minister Barbara Pompili told Le Monde newspaper that the project was now ""obsolete"". ""We will always need planes, but we must move towards a more reasonable use of air travel, and reach a reduction in the sector's greenhouse gas emissions,"" she said. Julien Bayou, head of France's Green Party, said it was ""a great victory for environmentalists"" against what he called ""an idiotic project"". Charles de Gaulle airport, which opened in 1974, is the second busiest airport in Europe after London Heathrow, with more than 76 million passengers passing through in 2019. First announced three years ago and with building work set to begin in the months ahead, Terminal 4 was described as an airport within an airport - the equivalent of putting Paris's second airport Orly inside Charles de Gaulle.    By the end of the 2030s it was projected to handle 450 extra flights at the airport every day.  But since approval, two things have happened.   First, in order to respect carbon emission targets, the government now says any airport development must accommodate electric and hydrogen-fuelled planes of the future.  The second change is Covid. With air traffic today just a quarter of its pre-crisis levels, mammoth expansion schemes like Terminal 4 appear distinctly irrelevant.

New town centre vaccination hub to open next week,"A new coronavirus mass vaccination centre in Douglas town centre will open next week, the government has confirmed. About 460 people are booked to receive a jab at the site in a former supermarket on Market Street on Monday. It will replace the facility that had been operating at Noble's Hospital since 4 January. Health Minister David Ashford said the opening was an ""important step in the delivery of our vaccination programme"". The new hub comprises 10 patient cubicles, waiting and administration areas and a specialist storage area and preparation room. Parking for those visiting is available at the nearby Chester Street car park and on the Douglas Promenade Walkway. Since 4 January, doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been administered from Monday to Wednesday at the Newlands building on the Noble's Hospital site. That facility, which saw 9,054 jabs given, was closed on Wednesday evening. Doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been administered at the island's first mass vaccination hub based at Ronaldsway Airport, in Ballasalla, since 28 January. About 200 people who are unable to travel to either of the larger hubs will received the jabs at a ""pop-up"" vaccine clinic at Ramsey Cottage Hospital on Saturday, a government spokesman said. It follows concerns that the airport hub may difficult for those living in the north of the island who have mobility issues to access.

Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking?,"By Nicola BryanBBC News Teachers are being advised to wear face masks in some circumstances as schools prepare to welcome back children aged three to seven. On 22 February, the foundation phase will join children classed as vulnerable and those of critical or key workers who have have been able to remain in school during lockdown. While some schools in areas with higher rates of Covid-19 infection will delay reopening, it will mean the ""nightmare"" of juggling working from home and home-schooling will end for many. But some parents might be anxious about what sort of learning environment awaits their children. The Welsh Government has published new safety guidance for schools ahead of the return. From school cleaning to uniforms, transport and lunches - here is everything you need to know about children's' return to school. Absence will not be penalised during this period, the guidance says.  It adds is a parent or carer wishes for their child to be absent ""we expect schools to authorise the absence during this time"". It says schools should continue to record attendance in the register and follow up on absences where learners are expected in school. Yes. The Welsh Government says face masks should be worn by staff if social distancing cannot be maintained - it has acknowledged young children ""will not be able to maintain social distancing"". It says both staff and secondary school learners should wear face masks anywhere on the school estate, including in the classroom. The exception is at mealtimes and when they are outside, unless the school risk assessment indicates that additional measures are needed. Schools should ensure adequate waste bins on premises for those who choose to use single-use face coverings. Visitors to the school should also use a face covering, including parents and carers when dropping off and picking up. People need to wash their hands both before and after putting on and removing face coverings. No. The Welsh Government says it recognises younger children ""will not be able to maintain social distancing"", adding it is ""acceptable for them not to distance within their group"".  Staff need to maintain social distance from other staff and also from learners ""as much as possible, recognising this may not be possible with younger learners"". The guidance says if possible, staff responsible for younger learners should remain with set groups rather than interchange between different groups. Where children undertake desk-based learning, classrooms should have forward-facing desks, one metre apart, the guidance says. The guidance recognises ""this may not be possible or appropriate in all schools and settings and particularly for younger learners"". Schools have been told to make the most of the space available, including outdoor space Schools have been told to ensure enhanced cleaning takes place, including cleaning frequently touched surfaces often, using standard products such as detergents and disinfectants. Where possible, schools should provide separate toilets for different contact groups.  Where this is not possible, hand sanitiser should be used before entering the toilet. The guidance advises grouping learners together in ""as small a group as possible"".  ""For example, for those learners in the foundation phase this is likely to be the size of the class,"" it adds. It says mixing between separate contact groups, including during arrival at school, break/lunch times and leaving school, should be avoided.  Where possible, schools need to ensure appropriate ventilation, the guidance says.  Mechanical ventilation systems should be adjusted to increase the ventilation rate wherever possible. Windows should be opened - in cooler weather windows should be opened ""just enough to provide constant background ventilation"" and opened more fully during breaks. It says opening internal doors can also assist with increasing air circulation. The guidance says hands should be cleaned thoroughly more often than usual with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use a hand sanitiser if soap and water are unavailable. It says small children and those with complex needs should continue to be helped to clean their hands properly. Automated soap dispensers should be used where possible and hands should preferably be dried using paper towels.  Hand dryers should be avoided where possible. The guidance says some schools ""may feel it is appropriate"" to relax their uniform policy during this period. It points out that school uniform and general clothing shops are currently closed under the Wales-wide alert level four lockdown.  ""This is a decision for school leaders,"" it adds.  Gloves, aprons and a fluid-resistant surgical mask should be worn if a child becomes unwell with Covid symptoms and needs direct personal care, the guidance says.  Eye protection should also be worn if a risk assessment determines there is a risk of splashing to the eyes such as from coughing, spitting, or vomiting. Gloves and aprons should also be used when cleaning the areas where a person suspected of having the virus has been. Gloves and aprons should continue to be used when providing personal care to a child or young person, it says. This can include personal, hands-on care such as washing, toileting, or first aid and certain clinical procedures such as assisted feeding. This depends on whether catering facilities are still available within the school in question.  If catering facilities are open, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with lunch on each day they attend. Other learners will still be expected to pay for their meals.  If  the school's catering facilities are closed, those eligible for free school meals will be provided with vouchers, food parcels or payments. All learners can be required to bring in a packed lunch.  Local authorities remain under a statutory duty to provide free home to school transport for all eligible learners of compulsory school age who live over 2 miles from their primary, or three miles from their secondary school. Risk assessments must be completed and signed off by the appropriate local authority officer. There is no requirement to wear a face covering on dedicated home-to-school transport. There is no requirement to maintain contact groups on school transport providing a consistent group of learners travel on the same bus each day they attend.

Vaccinations in Scotland 'may need to slow down',"Scotland's vaccination programme is likely to slow down later this month because of supply problems, the first minister has warned.  Nicola Sturgeon said a ""temporary reduction"" in Pfizer's manufacturing capacity meant the country had received slightly lower stocks of the vaccine than expected. This means the number of vaccination appointments is likely to be reduced. But Ms Sturgeon said Scotland is still on track to hit its vaccine targets. And she said the country would be able to ""rapidly accelerate"" the vaccination programme again if supplies increase again.  A further 63,178 people had their first dose of the vaccine on Wednesday - the highest in a single day so far despite the bad weather - bringing the total in Scotland to 1,048,747. The figure for the UK as a whole stands at more than 13 million.  Nearly a quarter (23%) of all adults in Scotland have had their first dose, including about 97% of over 80-year-olds, 87% of those aged between 75 and 79 and 54% of 70 to 74-year-olds.  Ms Sturgeon said the figures meant that Scotland had given the first dose to 75,000 more people than than had originally been expected by this stage.  And she said it gave ""real hope"" that the vaccine will soon start to have an impact on the number of people dying or becoming seriously ill with the virus.  But she said the higher than expected take-up, alongside reduced supplies of the Pfizer jab and the need to preserve some stocks for second doses, meant that ""we may need to reduce the number of appointments that we schedule over the next few weeks"". The first minister added: ""This sort of issue is not unexpected, given the huge complexities that the vaccination programme throws up.  ""Importantly, we remain on course to meet the key targets we have set out.  ""And we still anticipate, subject to supply, that everyone over the age of 50 will have received their first dose by early May."" It was revealed last month that the UK was set to face short-term delays in delivery of the Pfizer jab as the pharmaceutical company upgraded its production capacity. Pfizer is upscaling production at its plant in Puurs, Belgium, in efforts to produce more doses than originally planned for 2021 - temporarily reducing deliveries to all European countries. The American firm said at the time that this would mean ""fewer doses will be available for European countries at the end of January and the beginning of February.""

She added: ""That will reduce our expected supply next week and the week after by about somewhere between 120,000 and 190,000 doses a week overall over the two vaccines."" But the UK government said it was ""confident of our vaccine supply"" and that it would be able to hit its target of vaccinating everyone in the top four priority groups by next Monday.  The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""We are confident of supplies but we haven't commented on details of delivery schedules or movements of the vaccines.""  And a spokeswoman from Northern Ireland's Department of Health said: ""We are not aware of any Pfizer supply issues and are continuing to work through the priority groups as planned."" Meanwhile, the deaths of a further 48 people in Scotland who had previously tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total by that measure to 6,599. However, only 4% of the tests carried out on Wednesday returned positive results - down from 4.8% the previous day. The R number - effectively the rate at which the virus is transmitted - continues to be below one.  And the number of people in hospital wards with the virus has now fallen slightly below the peak from the first wave last year, with the number of patients in ICU units also gradually falling.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-56027662,1
Asthma sufferers' 'confusion' over Covid vaccine,"By Rachel SchraerHealth reporter  Asthma sufferers have called for clarity from government over ""confusion"" about whether they will be prioritised for the Covid vaccine. It has confirmed the most severe cases who have been advised to shield will be prioritised for the jab by 15 February.  And younger people requiring ""repeated or continuous"" use of oral steroids or with previous hospital admissions will be vaccinated ahead of their peers. The NHS defined non-severe asthmatics as being at ""moderate risk"" from Covid. Asthma UK previously said it understood anyone using a steroid inhaler would be prioritised for a vaccine.  A guide still on the government website also states the vaccine will be offered to ""adults with...breathing problems like asthma (use of steroid inhaler often)"". But separately the government has said the priority groups for vaccination would include all those who need regular ""systemic"" steroids for asthma. ""Systemic"" steroids are nearly always in the form of tablets, though Asthma UK is still in the process of confirming whether priority six will include people using steroid inhalers.  The government said it was following independent experts' advice on how vaccines should be allocated. James, a 37-year-old commercial manager from Chesterfield, said he had been left off the list despite suffering from both moderate asthma and having suffered a pulmonary embolism as a result of a rare blood clotting disorder that has caused lasting lung damage. He believes he has ""fallen through the cracks"" despite vascular disease appearing on the priority list, leaving him feeling frustrated and forgotten.  And Jeff Hunt, a 50-year-old from Somerset, said his moderate asthma had not required hospitalisation because he had been ""extremely cautious"" - but that didn't mean his condition didn't put him at risk.  ""I'm really frustrated with the government guidance being so unclear,"" he said. ""It doesn't feel like it makes sense"". ""We're all being called for an annual flu jab but now we're being told we're at no greater risk than the average population,"" he added. Mr Hunt criticised the lack of consistency in the guidance meaning some people were getting the jab while others on the same medication were not.  Others spoke of a lack of clarity over what ""severe asthma"" meant, and being made to feel ""troublesome"" or like they were trying to jump the queue when they enquired.  The nine priority groups are based on preventing deaths in the most vulnerable and protecting health and care staff.  Since age is the biggest risk factor for Covid deaths, the first three groups are: Group four covers people who are ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" - those who have received a letter advising them to shield.  When it comes to asthma, the confusion has been around who falls into priority group six - those who are not formally shielding but are considered clinically ""at risk"". That group should be vaccinated after healthy over-65s but before anyone younger than that without health conditions And for asthma it appears to have similar criteria to group four - those advised to shield - but the difference is likely to be in the dose of steroids taken or whether they are taking any other medications, such as ones which target antibodies in the blood to prevent inflammation. Well-controlled asthma that doesn't require oral steroids is not thought to increase someone's risk of dying from Covid. This is based on the medical records of people with asthma who contracted Covid over the past year.  It is understood the government will aim to offer the jab to group six - and all over-50s - by May.    And the government aims to vaccinate everyone in the first four priority groups by mid-February.    Asthma UK and British Lung Foundation chief executive Sarah Woolnough said: ""We know that many people with asthma are confused about when they will get the vaccine and what priority group they fall into.  ""We've been urging the government for some months to provide clarity on this, as we know it's a worrying time for lots of people. ""And we now have more information."" But, she added: ""It may be hard to accurately identify everyone in this [priority-six] group. ""The government should err on the side of caution in decision-making and cast its net wide when making decisions about definitions, to ensure that people with asthma who are at risk won't be missed.""  As well as being an indicator of how severe someone's asthma is, steroids suppress the immune system, making it harder to fight off viruses.  Ms Woolnough said: ""Reassuringly, evidence now shows that people with well controlled asthma that is not severe don't seem to be at higher risk of dying from Covid-19."" But some people with asthma have expressed concerns online about their wider health including the risks of long Covid.  NHS England said it would be offering vaccines based on the government's nine categories and patients' medical records.  CLARIFICATION: The article previous stated all steroid-users would be prioritised and has been updated to reflect that only those using oral steroids have been confirmed. The BBC is seeking further clarification over inhaled steroids. ",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56012530,1
'Worrying' if minorities don't get jab - Van-Tam,"England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer says it ""really concerns"" him that fewer BAME people may get the Covid vaccine.  Professor Jonathan Van-Tam is worried ""the uptake in minority ethnic groups is not going to be as rapid or as high"" compared to the white population. However he did stress that vaccine uptake has been very high among people who have been offered it so far. He added that fake news about the vaccine worries him too. Studies suggest the virus has hit ethnic minority communities proportionally worse than white communities in the UK.  Prof Van-Tam says the virus ""does not discriminate"". Turning to one conspiracy theory - that the vaccine increases infertility - Professor Van Tam said he's never heard of a vaccine that affects fertility and described it as a ""nasty, pernicious scare story, but that's all it is."" ""We are always concerned when we get disinformation and things that are patently wrong and misleading and designed to frighten people and damage their confidence in what we are doing - which I believe in absolutely passionately."" He added that he believes ""the vast majority of people in the UK would prefer to take their advice on vaccines from trusted sources rather than from some of the nonsense that is circulated on social media."" Over 12 million people in the UK have now had one dose of the vaccine - with no significant side effects found. That's something he called ""a very reassuring signal right across the board."" Jonathan Van-Tam was answering audience questions as part of a #BBCYourQuestions session. When asked about whether being vaccinated would be made mandatory, he said we did not have a tradition of doing that in the UK.  However he did say it was ""plausible"" other countries could require you to be vaccinated to enter them. And while he says mandatory vaccination could be good to increase uptake ""on the face of it"", he warns that could ""create resistance,"" which would end up having the opposite effect. He reiterated that the vast majority of people have got the vaccine when offered - more than 90% in over-75s so far. There were also questions about a variant of the virus first found in South Africa, which may spread more easily. The government has started door-to-door testing in parts of England where this variant has been found, in order to try and suppress its transmission. However, Prof Van-Tam says the number of known cases of this version of the virus is less than 200 in the UK, and the rate of its growth means it's not overtaking the dominant strains in the UK. There have been thousands of new strains of the virus and most are insignificant. Prof Van-Tam says it's a ""likely"" future that tweaked vaccines are brought out periodically to help battle newer strains. ""It may well look like the annual flu programme as things settle down over a period of years."" Follow Newsbeat on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Pub loses appeal over social-distancing breaches,"The director of a village pub where customers were seen flouting social-distancing rules has lost an appeal against a Covid-19 improvement notice. Christopher Callow was notified on 21 December over breaches at the Beehive Inn, Eamont Bridge, near Penrith. It followed three incidents at the pub in October and December 2020. Mr Callow told Carlisle Magistrates' Court rules had been followed, but the appeal was rejected and he was ordered to pay Â£1,750 costs. The court was told that on 29 October, Steve Wilde, a licensing and enforcement officer at Eden District Council, saw two men sitting and one man standing ""very close together"" at the bar.  During a subsequent visit on 19 December, the same officer saw six people in ""workmen"" uniforms drinking together.  On 17 December, police called by pub staff to deal with a fight at the premises observed a group of more than six men sat together watching football. The court heard there was no social distancing in all three cases, which led to the Beehive being served with the notice - a first step for a local authority to encourage businesses to correct unsafe practices.  The pub was told to stop taking non-household bookings and improve social distancing.  Mr Callow claimed the taking of non-household bookings was not a breach of government guidelines and suggested documentation he had received was ""defective"". He presented magistrates with a bundle of documents and photographs highlighting significant steps taken to comply with ever-changing regulations, and insisted staff took responsibilities ""very seriously"".  ""We follow all the government guidelines,"" he said. ""We've taken every reasonable step we can as a business."" Freddie Humphreys, representing Eden District Council, said the narrow appeal issue for magistrates was whether, in Mr Wilde's opinion, rules had been contravened. Mr Wilde told the court the premises was ""good"" in terms of measures put in place but said there had been breaches. Mr Humphreys added of the pub: ""It is not doing enough to actually enforce these when individuals are in there."" Rejecting Mr Callow's appeal and ordering him to pay Â£1,750 costs, lead magistrate Chris Drouet said: ""Mr Wilde was correct, in his opinion, that the Covid regulations were not being adhered to, and was justified in serving the notice.""

Should I double up and wear two face masks now?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online New research from the US suggests wearing two masks at the same time could give better protection against coronavirus and prevent air leaks. Face coverings reduce the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and speaking, but they must be a good fit. With new, more contagious variants of the virus circulating, the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says people may have a better fit and more protection if they wear two masks at the same time. Other tips for the wearer include: The highest level of protection is provided by FFP3 (or similar) masks worn by healthcare workers in high risk settings to safely do their job. In some countries, such as Germany and Austria, medical-grade masks (such as disposable surgical ones) are compulsory on public transport and in shops. These are made from non-woven fabric, which is better at stopping spray and droplets. Cloth face coverings do not give the wearer as much protection. But the World Health Organization says it has no plans to change its guidance recommending fabric face masks for the general public.  The main purpose of face coverings is to protect other people from coronavirus, rather than yourself. If everyone wears one, the risk for all goes down. When worn correctly, they should cover the nose and mouth - the main confirmed sources of transmission.  They can help to reduce the spread of the virus from people who are contagious, including those who have no symptoms. There is also evidence they can offer some protection to the wearer, although they are not a replacement for social distancing and hand-washing. Face coverings (or masks) are now compulsory across the UK on public transport and in most indoor public spaces. The exact rules can be seen here for:  People can be refused travel for not following the rules, or fined. In England and Northern Ireland the police can issue a Â£200 fine. In Scotland and Wales, a Â£60 fine can be imposed. Repeat offenders face bigger fines. Some people do not have to wear a face covering. They include: You can remove your mask if: Young children should not wear face masks because of the risk of choking and suffocation. Government guidance says you do not have to show any written evidence for why you are exempt.  There are no official exemption cards or badges, although the government provides some suggested templates which people can use if they wish.  There is more specific guidance about face coverings and exemptions in Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. Primary and secondary schools in the UK have moved to remote learning for most pupils. The government does not recommend wearing face coverings in classrooms because of measures already in place. However, each nation has different rules: The BBC has created a guide on how to make your own face covering.  The government has issued its own advice too. When will lockdown rules change?

Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008',"Nearly 225,000 people in England have now waited more than 12 months for routine hospital treatment - the highest number since April 2008, NHS England figures show. This includes people waiting for planned knee and hip surgery. It comes as growing numbers of operations were postponed during December when Covid cases rose rapidly. In January 2021 alone, hospitals treated nearly a third of all patients with Covid since the pandemic began. Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said staff had worked extremely hard to provide essential services during the pandemic.  He added: ""Even in January, when hospitals admitted almost a third of all the Covid patients they have treated during the pandemic, they were treating twice as many patients with other conditions as they did for those with the virus over the month. ""But the NHS remains under significant pressure so it is vital that everyone continues to do all they can to stop the spread of the virus by  staying at home and following the expert 'hands, face, space' guidance."" Despite Covid, NHS England says more than six million elective treatments were completed last year and average waiting times for non-urgent surgery fell by more than 40% between July and the end of the year. The Royal College of Surgeons of England, said Covid-19 continued to take an enormous toll on hundreds of thousands of people across the country left waiting for an operation.  Vice president, Mr Tim Mitchell, said the number waiting over a year for their treatment was now 150 times higher than it had been in 2019.   ""Many are waiting in limbo, reliant on painkillers, and unable to get on with day-to-day family life or work,"" he said. Although infection rates are now coming down in many parts of the country, Mr Mitchell warned many staff were ""burnt-out"" from what had been ""a brutal and traumatic year"" and would need time to recover. The figures suggest cancer services are recovering.  During December, just over 200,000 patients received urgent checks by cancer specialists and 25,000 people started their treatment - both measures are in line with numbers seen before the pandemic. But Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at Macmillan Cancer Support, said 2020 had been a ""devastating year"" for many people living with cancer ""who faced agonising delays or disruption to diagnosis and treatment"". She urged anyone experiencing cancer symptoms to contact their GP without delay and go to medical appointments.

Tonnes of cheese at risk of being thrown away,"Up to two tonnes of cheese is at risk of being thrown away by a company struggling to sell off its stock during lockdown. Cornish Blue cheese takes about 10 weeks to mature and then has to be sold within six weeks. It is made by the Cornish Cheese Company which sells 80% of its product to the hospitality sector which has been closed since early January. The company said the cheese would go off within two to three weeks. Ben Stansfield said: ""We were making this cheese back in October and September, and we didn't expect a lockdown in January, February, March and maybe even longer.  ""And because of hospitality having to close we lost our wholesale business overnight. We have got a big fridge full - about two tonnes. ""Normally we could sell this easily with all the wholesalers open, but it is all going to go off within two to three weeks.  ""We are trying our best to not have to throw any away but we won't be able to sell it after that and you can't freeze two tonnes of cheese."" The company, based on Bodmin Moor, has developed its online platform in recent months and appealed on social media for people to buy the remaining stock. Founder, and Ben's dad, Philip Stansfield said: ""What catches us out is when lockdown finishes and you haven't got enough cheese.  ""We could have sold twice as much last July and August which are our busiest months if we had had the stock. ""At the moment we are not sure when to start pushing again. It's a nightmare. If we don't open until May we have got to have cheese to sell as May, June, July and August is when it starts to get really busy for us."" The company is currently only making cheese one day a week ""to keep us ticking over, and the milk being used"", they explained. Other cheese makers have cut back on production and have lost sales through pubs and restaurants being closed. Martin Gaylard, from Curds and Croust, near Liskeard, said his soft cheese matures after about 20 days. ""I have had to put the brakes on,"" he said. ""It affects me in terms of sales but doesn't affect me in terms of having lots of cheese with nowhere for it to go, because I'm not producing it.""

'Tolkien' pub 'could be community asset',"A historic pub, which closed after more than 400 years, could be named an Asset of Community Value (ACV), the Oxford Liberal Democrats have said. The Lamb & Flag, once frequented by authors JRR Tolkien, CS Lewis, and Thomas Hardy, closed in January. The Lib Dems said if it was an ACV the community could purchase it and prevent it from being demolished. But Oxford University's St John's College, which runs the pub, said it remained ""optimistic"" about its future. The Lamb & Flag opened on St Giles in 1613, but its owners said it was ""hard hit by the pandemic"" in 2020. Staff were placed on furlough in March. It reopened in August, but was unable to break even. The Lib Dems said if a ""long-term commercial solution"" was not found, a community group could buy it to ensure planning permission was needed for any change of use or demolition. Andrew Gant, leader of the opposition at Oxford City Council, called the Lamb & Flag a ""historic institution"". ""We will do everything we can in the city council to ensure that it has not pulled its last pint because of the pandemic, so it can be enjoyed for future generations of residents and tourists,"" he added. The college said it had ""received a number of enquiries"" about the Grade II listed building's future.   It said it was ""encouraged by the support and appreciation"" which confirmed its ""special place"" in Oxford's history. In a statement it added: ""Given the challenges the college faces during the Covid-19 restrictions, the college is not in a position to discuss future commercial arrangements for the pub at this stage. ""However, despite the immediate uncertainties, the college remains optimistic for the longer-term future of The Lamb & Flag."" Tolkien and Lewis were said to have frequented the pub, though the nearby Eagle and Child was their usual choice for literary meetings. The Lamb & Flag was also said to have inspired parts of Hardy's novel Jude the Obscure, and has appeared in the TV series Endeavour. Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Plea for patience despite vaccination rate rise,"A health board with the highest percentage of vaccinated adults in mainland Scotland has warned it is ""far too soon"" to ease Covid restrictions. More than one in four people in Dumfries and Galloway have now received a first dose. Immunisation co-ordinator Dr Nigel Calvert said they were ""delighted"" with the progress being made. However, he urged people to stick with the rules despite the speed of the programme's delivery. ""At the latest figures about 38,000 people have now had their first dose which is a big chunk of the population,"" he said. The health board plans to move on to the 60 to 64 age group from Monday. Dr Calvert said that despite the vaccination levels being achieved it would need time before there could be any easing of restrictions. ""It is very important that people still follow the rules,"" he said. ""It takes up to about 21 days for the vaccines to work and it is still far too soon to be talking about relaxing things too much."" He said they would be ""very grateful"" if the public could continue to observe the restrictions in place. ""It has been a long time, we do appreciate people's co-operation with this,"" he said. ""We're getting there, this vaccine will be the way out of this pandemic but it really is too soon to start relaxing things."" Meanwhile, health officials have renewed their appeal for people in the Stranraer area to come forward for testing even if they do not have Covid symptoms.

Can I book a holiday in the UK?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News Coronavirus lockdowns mean non-essential travel is currently banned. How could things change later on in the year, and what are your rights if you book a UK holiday now? Under the coronavirus lockdowns, holiday travel is not allowed in the UK. Journeys are only allowed for limited reasons, such as exercise, essential shopping and work that cannot be done from home. You cannot stay overnight anywhere outside your main residence unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" for doing so, such as visiting your support bubble. This includes a second home, caravan or boat, if it isn't where you normally live.  The rollout of the coronavirus vaccine combined with international travel restrictions mean many people have started thinking about booking holidays in the UK.  But there have been mixed messages from ministers: ""My feeling is that we will be able to take staycations from 1 April onwards,"" Paul Charles, head of the travel consultancy the PC agency, predicts. ""There are likely to be social distancing restrictions but I think it will be very possible to stay in a cottage over the Easter weekend."" He thinks Scotland may adopt a more cautious approach. Most accommodation and holiday providers are offering flexible booking policies for future trips, to try to boost confidence. This should be laid out in the terms and conditions of any company you book with. The UK watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), suggests you should usually get your money back if coronavirus restrictions scupper your holiday plans.  It says this would be the case if a business cancels your booking, or can't provide the service due to lockdown laws, or you can't go on a booked holiday because the rules would make it illegal. The CMA says you should receive a full refund under most circumstances, with non-refundable deposits ""likely to be unfair, and therefore unenforceable"". If you decide to cancel a holiday due to government guidance the CMA suggests you should not face ""disproportionately high"" charges for doing so. These should only cover the amount of money the business can expect to lose.  Vouchers or postponement can be offered, but you are not obliged to accept this over a cash refund. A few insurance policies will cover you if you miss a holiday because you have been diagnosed with coronavirus, or because you are required to self-isolate, as long as you already held the policy. If the holiday provider refuses to pay or goes bust and you paid by credit card you can claim from your card company for services not rendered under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. You must have spent between Â£100 and Â£30,000 to be eligible. If you paid on debit card, you may be able to secure a refund under the chargeback scheme. Which countries trigger hotel quarantine?

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Thursday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The coronavirus variant which was first detected in Kent last yearÂ is set to become the world's dominant strain, according to the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme. Prof Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has ""swept the country"" and ""it's going to sweep the world, in all probability"". The Kent variant was originally detected in September 2020 and has since been found in more than 50 countries. ButÂ Prof Peacock said vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country. You can read more about coronavirus variations and mutations here, and take a look at the science behind the changes.Â  The prisons watchdog says inmates in England are being kept locked in their cells for more than 90% of the day as part of efforts to prevent Covid-19 outbreaks in jails. Predictions that up to 2,000 prisoners would die in the outbreak in England and Wales without action have been avoided. But one inmate told inspectors that measures taken to keep them safe were like ""being imprisoned while you're in prison"". The prisons minister Lucy Frazer told the BBC that actions taken by front-line staff had ""significantly limited"" the spread of the virus and prisoners are being supported. People who need ""continuous or repeated"" steroid use because of asthma are to be prioritised for the Covid vaccine. The government has decided that anyone who needs steroids for their asthma will be able to get a jab, after healthy over-65s have been vaccinated and before people who are younger with no health conditions. It is thought this should be done by May. Asthma charities say it may be hard to identify everyone who is eligible and health officials should ""cast the net wide"" to ensure people won't be missed. Wales' first minister has said that the country is one of the first in the world - and the first UK nation - to get a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine into the arms of a fifth of the population. Mark Drakeford confirmed more than 655,000 people (20.8%) had been given their jabs. Across the rest of the UK, England's total has reached more than 11 million doses, which is 19.7% of the population, while Scotland's rate has risen to 18% and Northern Ireland's is 17.6%. After Nikki Hazlehurst lost her job last year as a member of airline cabin crew, she applied for work at the Nightingale Hospital in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. ""I went from drinks, snacks and really happy people to somewhere there's a lot of doom and gloom. It's scary,"" she told Radio 1 Newsbeat. But she adds that her customer service skills ""have really helped"" and that lugging cages around the hospital is not unlike moving catering trolleys on a plane. But Nikki really hopes to be back in the air in 12 months - along with her partner, who recently got his commercial pilot's licence.

Starmer: 10-year Covid jail terms 'empty threat',"Sir Keir Starmer has criticised the proposed maximum 10-year jail term for people lying about their recent travel history as an ""empty threat"".  The Labour leader said ""pretending"" judges would sentence anyone to that long in prison ""wouldn't help anyone"". Ministers have said the public expects strong action and the maximum sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime. But critics, including ex-Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption, have argued lower tariffs exist for sex offences. From Monday, people arriving in England from ""red list"" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, costing Â£1,750. It follows concerns that existing vaccines being rolled out in the UK may struggle to control new virus variants identified around the world. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the hotel quarantine plan was ""measured"" and ""proportionate"". But Sir Keir, a barrister who was England's director of public prosecutions before entering politics, questioned how realistic it was.  ""I have prosecuted many cases that have ended in a 10 year sentence and I know an empty threat when I see it... pretending that there's going to be a 10 year sentence, I don't think is going to help anyone,"" he said. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Sumption accused Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who announced the latest measures on Tuesday - of losing his connection with reality. ""Ten years is the maximum sentence for threats to kill, non-fatal poisoning or indecent assault,"" he wrote.  ""Does Mr Hancock really think that non-disclosure of a visit to Portugal is worse than the large number of violent firearms offences or sexual offences involving minors, for which the maximum is seven years?"" Failing to quarantine in a designated hotel after arriving from a ""red list"" country will carry a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. The 10-year jail term would be the maximum penalty for anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK. New border measures also require international arrivals to pay for additional tests during their quarantine period. Downing Street said MPs will not be asked to vote on the plans as the government will be including the restrictions under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. Conservative MP Alberto Costa, a ministerial aide to the Attorney General, told the BBC the UK was facing a ""once in a century"" public health crisis, which justified measures that would otherwise not be contemplated.  He told the BBC it was not up to politicians to decide the length of sentences, but it was right that judges should have the discretion to impose long custodial terms for the ""most egregious breaches of the worst sort"" - as had long been the case with other criminal offences. Knowingly flouting the regulations and putting other's lives at risk was, he said, ""a serious matter and people need to understand that"".  Mr Costa added: ""It is about reinforcing in people's minds the importance of the Covid restrictions and abiding by them."" Around 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from the 33 red list countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - at the moment, Mr Shapps said. International travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. Airlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said. The penalties also include a Â£1,000 fine for travellers who fail to take the new mandatory tests and a Â£2,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine. The Scottish government said it would go further than England's measures and require everyone arriving by air to isolate in hotels for 10 days. All travellers arriving in the UK are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test and must self-isolate for 10 days. Have you recently travelled into the UK?

College delivers food parcels to new learners,"A college is delivering food to people who enrol on a new maths GCSE course.  South Gloucestershire and Stroud (SGS) College, in Bristol, said there was a link between education and food poverty which had been amplified during the pandemic.  The Food for Thought scheme aims to encourage adults aged 19 plus to do a free maths GCSE course at home. While studying on the eight-week course, college staff will safely deliver a food parcel worth Â£25.  The parcel will contain fresh fruit and vegetables, tinned items, staple ingredients and cleaning products. Learners will also be provided with learning materials by a member of the SGS home study team. Matt Davis, from the college, said the demand for maths courses had been ""on the rise during lockdown"", with parents or guardians looking to upskill to support children with their schoolwork. If the scheme is successful the college said it might extend the food parcel initiative to other subject areas.  Katie, who did not want to give her full name, from Patchway, said: ""I've never gained any maths qualifications and since lockdown started I've been looking to change that. ""The bonus of food deliveries provides some much needed stress relief while I study."" So far 120 people have enrolled on the course which is offered to households within a three miles radius of the Filton SGS College campus, or in Patchway, Emersons Green or Severn Beach.  Project co-ordinator Laura Gaiger, who has been delivering the food parcels, said it was a ""really positive project to be a part of"". Mark Jones, head of academic studies at SGS College, added that they were ""profoundly aware"" of the impact lockdown was having on their 16 to 18 cohort but also their adult learners.  ""This way we can combine supporting those people with a longer vision to inspire them into education or to think about their employment opportunities post-pandemic,"" he said.

Food traders say Brexit impact 'could get worse',"By James CookChief news correspondent for The Nine  Scotland's food and drink industry is warning of price rises and potential shortages when new Brexit rules on imports come into force in April. The UK's departure from the European Union has already led to a forest of new paperwork for firms exporting to the continent. According to James Withers, of trade body Scotland Food and Drink, the impact has been ""horrendous"". He says the seafood sector alone was losing ""about a million pounds a day"". ""There's no sign of any improvement soon,"" Mr Withers says. ""In fact [there are] many signs things could get worse."" The UK government said it was working closely with businesses to make sure they could ""take advantage of the opportunities"" that leaving the European Union brings. It said businesses were adjusting well to the new trade rules, which are being phased in over the next few months, and it was offering extensive advice and support.  When Great Britain finally left the single market on Hogmanay the EU insisted on the immediate introduction of controls on exports to the continent but the UK government opted to wait until 1 April to introduce similar checks on imports. Mr Withers says: ""Those checks, when they're put in place, could also make things slow, more expensive and a lot more complex for EU businesses who need to sell products into businesses here.  ""And that's a big issue for supermarkets and will be a big issue for many food companies who get ingredients from Europe."" One of those companies is Charles Stamper Fruit and Veg in Edinburgh which sources much of its produce from Spain and the Netherlands. Managing director Louise Stamper says: ""One thing for certain is prices will go up.  ""It's going to just become very expensive to go out for a meal."" Ms Stamper founded the firm 32 years ago with her husband, Charles. They normally supply fresh fruit, vegetables and other produce to the hospitality industry, schools and nursing homes. Like many businesses they saw a heavy impact last year due to the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. Ms Stamper says the first lockdown in March last year saw them lose all but a handful of their customers. Switching to home deliveries helped but they didn't come close to making up for the lost trade. A year ago the firm employed 30 people. Now it has 15 staff. Making matters worse, Ms Stamper says imports are 20% more expensive than they were last winter, a rise which she attributes in part to Brexit-related border disruption. Mr Withers reckons that the enforced closure of hospitality, entertainment and tourism due to Covid cost food and drink firms Â£3bn in lost sales in 2020, in a sector worth Â£15bn annually to the country's economy, including Â£6bn of exports. Jim Cummiskey, chief executive of food wholesaler Failte Group, says the impact of the pandemic has been massive. ""To sum up the hospitality industry in one word: horrendous,"" he says. The Glasgow giant is based beside a huge food market at Blochairn in the north of the city and has three arms: produce, food service and wholesale. ""We've paid off probably 17 staff,"" says Mr Cummiskey, glancing around at empty shelves in a vast refrigerated warehouse which he says would usually be crammed with fresh produce. ""People just seem to think you can switch the lights back on and everything's going to be back to normal. That's not going to happen in this industry. It's going to take years of recovery,"" he says. Compared to the effects of the pandemic Mr Cummiskey views the long-term impact of leaving the EU as nothing more than an irritation. Bad weather rather than Brexit is to blame for seasonal price rises on continental goods, he argues. ""The UK will diversify,"" insists Mr Cummiskey. ""We always have and we always will. So we'll store more Scottish product when it's in season and we'll store more UK product when it's in season."" Some businesses which export to the EU are not so relaxed. Wilma Finlay and her husband David run an organic dairy farm near Gatehouse of Fleet in Galloway, famous for its ice cream and visitor centre. When the nation was ordered to stay at home in March last year, and again this winter, tourism and ice cream sales to restaurants collapsed. The impact on turnover was ""massive"" says Ms Finlay, ""absolutely massive"". Luckily the farm had recently branched out into the production of cheese with the creation of a company called The Ethical Dairy. ""Home delivery has just taken off,"" she explains. ""It went from 30 orders a week to 300 orders a week almost overnight."" That's nothing like enough to offset the farm's ice cream and tourism losses but if Scotland were still in the EU, says Ms Finlay, she would now be taking the cheese enterprise to the next stage by ramping up exports to the continent. The additional costs of Brexit have put paid to that ambition. They amount, she calculates, to Â£45 in time and paperwork on every Â£35 order. That's before she has even considered the cost of production or postage. ""It's just a non-starter,"" says Ms Finlay who describes the impact of Brexit as an ""annoyance"" and the pandemic as ""devastating"". What really surprised the Finlays though was the realisation that the EU-mandated checks and paperwork would also apply to trade with Northern Ireland where they had developed a number of loyal customers. The reason lies in the deal formalising the UK's exit from the EU which allowed Northern Ireland to remain in the single market to prevent the potentially incendiary return of an Irish land border. Instead there is now an Irish Sea border: dividing the UK, outraging unionists and leading to shortages of some goods in Northern Ireland. ""We hadn't seen that [Brexit] would also close the route to Northern Ireland because we're actually physically nearer to Belfast than we are to Glasgow and Edinburgh,"" says Ms Finlay who says she was deeply disappointed to be forced to stop supplying her Northern Irish customers. The disruption of commerce is also have an effect on the constitutional debate. In the 2016 referendum Brexit was supported by majorities of voters in England and Wales - and therefore by the UK overall - but it was opposed by 62% of people who cast ballots in Scotland and 56% in Northern Ireland. Since then support for Scottish independence has risen, with more than 20 polls in a row indicating a majority in favour of Scotland going it alone, and there has also been renewed discussion about the possibility of a referendum - known as a border poll - on Irish reunification. For now though a more pressing concern for business is the effect of the new checks and charges on imports from the EU to Britain due to come into effect on 1 April and whether they will lead to the shortages in Northern Ireland being replicated elsewhere in the UK? Mr Withers of Scotland Food and Drink is concerned. ""At the moment supply chains are pretty robust,"" he says. ""The big supermarkets know what they are doing but if the lessons of the first few weeks in trying to get products out of the country are replicated for products coming into the country, we could find a real challenge."" Fresh fruit and vegetables are particularly vulnerable, he warns, especially when they are out of season in Scotland. He says: ""What I do know is we sell Â£1.2bn of Scottish food into the European Union every year and that has got an awful lot more difficult, an awful lot more expensive and an awful lot slower.""

Kent virus variant 'on course to sweep world',"The coronavirus variant first found in Kent could become the world's dominant strain, the head of the UK's genetic surveillance programme has predicted. Prof Sharon Peacock told the BBC's Newscast podcast the new variant has ""swept the country"" and ""it's going to sweep the world, in all probability"". She said her team's work sequencing variants of the virus could be required for at least 10 years. The Kent variant has already been detected in more than 50 countries. It was first detected in September 2020 in south-east England and its rapid spread over the following months was cited as the reason for the introduction of new lockdown rules across the UK in January. Prof Peacock, director of the Covid-19 Genomics UK consortium, said: ""What's really affected us at the moment is transmissibility."" She added: ""Once we get on top of [the virus] or it mutates itself out of being virulent - causing disease - then we can stop worrying about it. But I think, looking in the future, we're going to be doing this for years. We're still going to be doing this 10 years down the line, in my view."" She explained this was not because she thought the pandemic would go on for 10 years, but she believed they would be sequencing new variants for that length of time. Current vaccines were designed around earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work against the new ones, although perhaps not quite as well. Prof Peacock said the vaccines approved for use in the UK appeared to work well against the existing variants of the virus in the country. The Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium is a network of public health bodies and labs and currently analyses more than 20,000 positive tests a week.  In recent weeks, it has been explained that about 5-10% of positive tests are selected randomly to be sent on for further genome analysis but the consortium says, as the number of cases falls below its capacity, its aim is to genetically screen every positive coronavirus test. Prof Peacock told Newscast that while it is normal to see variants, only a very small number have ""special features"". These can make them more transmissible, avoid the immune response and affect vaccination, or have the potential to cause more severe disease.  ""These are the things we are looking out for. I'd say it happens vanishingly rarely but we have to be on the look out for it,"" the expert, who was previously director of the government's National Infection Service, said. It comes as the World Health Organization is recommending using the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus. The Oxford jab has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data. Early data from trials in South Africa - where a variant has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections - showed the vaccine was offering ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease in young people. But the WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was ""inconclusive"" and it was ""plausible"" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease. Oxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to ""come forward"" this week. The government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February. As of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812. Will vaccines always work against Covid?

Doctor's portrait 'to help front-line staff talk',"An intensive care doctor captured in a ""powerful"" portrait said he hoped it would help front-line staff to discuss their experiences of the pandemic. Dr Andrew Johnston, of Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, was painted by artist Heath Rosselli, who spent most of last year working on the piece. The canvas will now go on display at the site, with plans to loan it out to other hospitals in future. Dr Johnston said the piece gave key workers a ""moment to reflect"". The portrait, titled Doctor J, is intended to encourage medics who feel they need help to contact with Our Frontline, set up in April by several charities to offer round-the-clock mental health and bereavement support for key workers. Dr Johnston described the finished portrait by Rosselli, who is based in Worlington, Suffolk, as ""incredibly powerful"".  ""It offers a glimpse of the emotional and physical toil this pandemic has had on staff, and provides a moment to reflect on how it has felt to work on the front line over the past year,"" he said.  ""A year into the pandemic, some staff are doing OK, while others are chronically stressed, distressed, exhausted and burning out. ""I imagine this may strike a chord with people from many different walks of life who work in front-line roles.  ""I hope it will show people that they're not alone - there is lots of support out there and I hope this will encourage anyone to reach out for help if they need it."" A recent report showed nearly half of critical care doctors and nurses have had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety or depression. Rosselli, who had her painting of a breast cancer survivor displayed at The Louvre in Paris and work exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery, said she wanted to capture the ""humanity and fragility behind the masks"". She worked on the painting in between her commissions in an effort to create a historical snapshot of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Dr Johnston's face may be covered, but his eyes speak volumes about the emotional and mental toll,"" she said. ""With the second spike and the enormous emotional burden that is once again on front-line staff, Dr Johnston's facial expression started to evolve.  ""We had no idea when I started the painting that the pandemic would be going on for so long, and I think the sheer relentlessness of it all is evident.""

Covid 'will affect youngest pupils for years',"Covid-caused disruption for children learning the basics of reading and counting could pose problems for years to come, a head teacher has warned. Matt Hood, principal of the online Oak National Academy, said early years teaching was ""sophisticated"" and it was ""unreasonable"" to expect parents to master it. He said we may see the impact when pupils sit GCSEs 10 years from now. The government said more than Â£1bn was being spent to help pupils catch up. Mr Hood, from Penrith in Cumbria, said there had been a six-month disruption in schooling, adding: ""The year groups I'm most worried about are reception and Year 1. ""I cannot stress enough how critical those early years are, focussed on learning sounds, how to read and count, those things are so fundamental.  ""They are some of the most sophisticated things to teach, it's not something you can reasonably expect any parent at home to become an expert in teaching."" Mr Hood, an economics teacher who is also chair of governors at Bay Leadership Academy in Morecambe, said teachers were experts at identifying variations in an individual pupil's knowledge and abilities and plugging gaps. He said: ""What we are going to see is that variation being significantly more complicated because what the teachers do not know is the extent to which every pupil has completed all their work in the way they would have in the school building."" The priority when full schooling resumes would be to ""identify gaps"" with each child, Mr Hood said. ""The big risk is we create a never-ending cycle of pupils needing to catch up.  ""One of the worst things you can do in most cases is take them out of their lessons to catch up. We want to them to spend their time with the most expert person they can, and that is their teacher."" Mr Hood has also worked with data companies to allow pupils free access to educational websites, as well as promoted drives to get internet-enabled devices to all children so ""disadvantaged"" pupils do not miss out further. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""The government will work with parents, teachers and schools to develop a long-term plan to make sure pupils have the chance to make up their lost education.""

Work to start on miners' £100k memorial,"A national memorial paying tribute to miners will be built after fundraisers say they have almost reached their Â£100,000 target. Chase Arts for Public Spaces (Chaps) has been raising money for the monument at the National Memorial Arboretum. The group said it will be a place for people to ""pay their respects to the men, women and children who worked and died"" in the industry over many years. Work will begin in April with a service planned for later in the year. Despite the coronavirus pandemic causing an ""immediate stop"" to fundraising efforts last summer, president Michael Mellor said Â£92,000 had now been donated. ""I'm elated now really,"" Mr Mellor said. ""I'm overwhelmed with the support we have received and are still receiving. It will be a fitting tribute to those brave people."" Sculptor Andy de Comyn is creating the 2m high by 5m long monument out of Derbyshire stone, which will depict the history of mining, including recognising the colliers' contribution to World War One and World War Two. Mr Mellor said the pandemic made them ""think outside the box"" about how to raise the money and they introduced the sponsorship of 24 plaques for Â£2,500 each. People will get to keep a cast of the plaques and a book that is being written detailing the stories of the men, women and children who went down the mines. ""We've uncovered some heart-rending stories,"" Mr Mellor said. ""We've identified 47 miners who were awarded the Victoria Cross in the first and second world wars and we're researching their family history and trying to find living relatives who can attend the dedication ceremony. ""One guy actually sold his Victoria Cross for Â£5 as he was down on his uppers, as it were, and short of food - you'll get to see all the brave stories."" The monument is due to be completed in May and its unveiling was due to happen at the Staffordshire site in June, but Mr Mellor said it had been postponed to September.

Staff at Covid-hit care home suffer 'flashbacks',"Healthcare staff have said they still suffer ""flashbacks"" after coronavirus tore through their care home, killing nine residents. Almost 80 percent of staff at Linden House in Somerset were taken ill or had to isolate over the Christmas period. Care home owner Sandra Joyce said it had been ""devastating"". Somerset County Council has thanked the workers in Wellington for their ""tremendous courage"" and ""bravery"". Despite the setback they still provided care for their residents with the staff that were available. Ms Joyce said she still had ""flashbacks"" from that time. ""I love what I do and I love being able to work with people, and not having enough staff in order to deliver the care that they needed at the time is devastating for me,"" she said. ""I had three hours to sleep (each night) and of course I didn't sleep, and I couldn't sleep because I was so worried. ""I know our residents didn't suffer, they just didn't get the usual standard of care."" Linden House's assistant administrator Laura Paul said she feels ""guilty"" whenever she leaves work at the end of the day.  ""I feel guilty that I'm walking away from people that are being left in such a stressful situation,"" she said. ""I leave there every day wishing I could have done more and I'm feeling quite useless at the moment."" 'Tremendous courage' Senior carer Rachel Ellis said: ""Working at Linden through the outbreak of Covid is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do in all my years of care. ""I just wish that we could all embrace each other like we want to by maybe giving a hug.""

'I was cabin crew - now I work on the front line',"By Rachel Stonehouse & Ben MundyNewsbeat Reporters Like lots of people, Nikki Hazelhurst lost her job last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""Before this I was cabin crew, it was my absolute dream job,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I'm obsessed with planes, but I'm not quite intelligent enough to fly one so I like to serve on them instead."" When she found herself out of a job, Nikki applied for work at Harrogate's Nightingale hospital, and then moved to the main hospital's PPE department. ""I went from drinks, snacks and really happy people to somewhere there's a lot of doom and gloom. It's scary."" Newsbeat spent two days in Harrogate Hospitals for a series of specials you can hear on Radio 1, 1Xtra, Asian Network or BBC Sounds. But Nikki's skills from her work as cabin crew have come in handy working for the NHS. ""My customer service skills have really helped, I'm a jolly person and I'm a really hard worker - plus lugging cages around the hospital is tough work, but I'm used to trollies on a plane"" she says cheerily. So where does Nikki hope to be in 12 months time? ""Wow - that has made me a bit emotional,"" she says. ""I don't want to be needed here, it's not a good thing, but I will do it."" Nikki's partner has recently got his commercial pilot's licence, and she hopes they can both take to the skies again in the future. ""In 12 months I want me and him to be back in the air - my favourite place in the world is 37,000 feet."" Like Nikki, Tom Bowe also worked at the Harrogate Nightingale before joining the district hospital. He finished a Masters Degree in Chemistry last May, but couldn't get a job in the field he wants to work in. ""I haven't been able to graduate yet because of the pandemic,"" he says. ""Because of coronavirus there's no jobs around for someone without experience."" But Tom says he's wanted to make himself useful, and is now working as a porter and facilities assistant, which he says involves a bit of ""everything"". ""I've probably changed 40 or 50 bins so far today,"" he tells us - as he changes another one. He says the work has been tough, but also been valuable life experience. ""It's definitely given me a different perspective to what's really going on, and opened my eyes to other jobs as well"". Physiotherapist Faith Waddell also found herself on the front line, unexpectedly, when she graduated last summer. ""I was redeployed to work in Intensive Care, which was scary and daunting at first,"" she says. 'I'd never even been in ICU before working there, so it was a fast learning curve and we had to step up'  ""It was the case for a lot of us though, and we get each other through it."" Faith says even though it's been a tough - and unexpected start to her career - there's also a more positive side to her job too. ""Our focus is getting people up and moving, and eventually home."" And sometimes there's the opportunity to reunite families, or couples who've both been admitted with Covid, but are on separate wards. ""Just the other day we managed to get a woman to her husband and he really picked up after her visit and was even walking today.

Average house price tops £200k in 'race for space',"By Brian Meechan & Llyr EdwardsBBC Wales News The average house price in Wales has gone over Â£200,000 for the first time, the country's biggest building society has said. The Principality said lockdown had encouraged a ""race for space"" with people buying larger properties with bigger gardens.  Eighteen of the 22 council areas in Wales saw record prices in the last three months of 2020. But sales were down 21% over that period compared with the previous year. All council areas saw an increase in prices from 2019. The average price for a home in Wales is Â£209,723. The Principality's House Price Index does not take account of inflation over years so this is the ""nominal value"" rather than the ""real value"". Taking account of inflation, Wales was 7% below the record high from September 2007 but is the highest since July 2008 in real terms. Prices rose by 8.2% in 2020, the highest rate of increase in 15 years. But there are concerns that some people might find themselves unable to get on to the property ladder due to rising prices. Not all property types are increasing equally, with demand for detached houses higher than other homes and the price of flats ""languishing since April 2020"". The Principality index is based on sales figures from HM Land Registry.  There were double digit increases in annual prices in Anglesey (16%), Conwy (14%), Monmouthshire (14%), Flintshire (13%) and Newport (12%). Bridgend, Ceredigion, Gwynedd and the Vale of Glamorgan were the only council areas that hadn't experienced peak prices but had still seen an increase from 2019. The Welsh Government removed land transaction tax from all property sales below Â£250,000 from July 2020 to March 2021, saving buyers almost Â£2,500 in tax per sale. Elfed Wyn Jones returned to live at his family's farm near Trawsfynydd, Gwynedd, last year after losing his job in Aberystwyth due to the pandemic. He and his girlfriend, Anwen Duncan, would like to buy their own family home nearby with at least two bedrooms and they could afford a mortgage of up to Â£110,000, but he often sees places selling for in excess of Â£200,000. ""When the rare opportunity comes up with something in our price range, it gets sold quite quickly,"" he said. He suggested a cap on the number of holiday lets in areas to stop them from ""driving up prices"". ""I know of about seven or eight of the couples in Trawsfynydd who'd love to buy a house and start a family but, again, the houses that are in their price range and my price range tend to sell like hot cakes,"" he said. ""It's quite heart-breaking really."" North Wales estate agent Dafydd Hardy said business had been ""good"" over the last year which he had not expected due to the pandemic. He said buyers have been looking to ""change lifestyle"" such as up-sizing. ""They've focused on their needs really, and that's what has created the market,"" he added. He said the current lockdown measures had hit the market, with house sales down about 40% locally compared to last year. ""But we are expecting that the market will take off again."" Tom Denman, chief financial officer at Principality Building Society, said: ""The strength of the housing recovery in the second half of 2020 is striking, and this reflects both the stimulus provided by the Welsh Government in terms of the time-limited land transaction tax holiday, the pent-up demand which built up during the first lockdown, and the race for space to buy bigger properties with larger gardens. ""This increased demand has been driven by increased savings in many households during the lockdowns coupled with continued historic low mortgage rates.  ""There has probably been some additional demand from buyers across the border with England, with house prices more affordable in Wales in relative terms,"" he added. House prices across the UK rose by 6.5% last year, according to Nationwide. But the Halifax suggested there had been a drop in prices UK-wide between December and January. ""On a range of metrics - buyer inquiries, instructions to sell, agreed sales, activity per surveyor and sales to stock ratio, Wales was equal to, or outperformed, the most active of English regions,"" the House Price Index concluded.   House price growth 'fastest for almost six years' Working from home leads to house price rises Second-home demand 'pricing out' community Second homes 'crisis' prompts 20-mile march House prices 'fall for first time in eight years' Building of new council homes ramped up",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56014730,1
How has coronavirus affected mental health?,"The coronavirus pandemic has led to concerns about a worsening of mental health across the UK but what's the scale of the problem? Mental health problems have worsened across all age-groups in the past year. In adults, the proportion of individuals showing symptoms of depression has almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, according to the Office for National Statistics.  In the run-up to the first lockdown, roughly 10% of people showed moderate to severe symptoms, compared with 19% in June 2020.  In children, 16% of 5-16 year olds have ""probable"" mental health disorders compared with 10.9% in 2017, according to NHS England.  Both of these studies are based on surveys which ask individuals questions related to mental health or depressive symptoms.  Due to the nature of mental health problems recording is difficult, but this form of survey provides the best estimates and allows for consistent comparison over time.  Coronavirus has fuelled feelings of loneliness, anxiety and fears for the future for many people.  According to the ONS, people with depressive symptoms were more likely to feel that their finances were being impacted, as well as access to care and essential goods.  They also were more likely to feel like their personal relationships were being impacted by the virus.  Children with mental health problems were more than twice as likely to live in a household that had fallen behind with payments, according to NHS England. They were also more likely to feel as if their lives had been made worse by lockdown.  Coronavirus has had an impact on the amount of people using publicly funded mental health service.  This is part of a broader trend across the whole of the NHS.  On an average month, the NHS talking therapies service can expect to receive about 150,000 referrals for treatment of common mental health problems such as depression or anxiety.  However, this dropped as low as 60,000 in April 2020.  This slowly returned back to normal over the summer, but it is unclear how the second and third lockdowns may have impacted it.  Access to children's and teenage mental health services also saw a dip in referrals and access to treatment over the first lockdown, according to analysis by the Children's Commissioner.  There has been a sharp increase in referrals since then, but the increases have not been matched with similar increases in children actually accessing the services. Part of these declines could be down to a big decrease in GP appointments or children not being at schools, which are often the referral point for new patients. The NHS has managed to ensure that those people who have been referred for talking therapies have been able to receive the treatment within target.  This means 95% of people are receiving treatment within 18 weeks.  Many mental health services already had the option to do therapy remotely meaning they could adapt quickly and get new patients started.  In the most recent two lockdowns, group therapy has also been considered a ""reasonable excuse"" to leave the home. There isn't enough data available to check if targets for access to children's mental health are being met.  It's too early to say.  This is because the process for registering these kinds of deaths takes substantially more time than deaths from natural causes.  Early research from the University of Manchester doesn't show any major increases.  However, they say that the longer-term impacts of a future economic downturn could have an impact and that some areas could end up seeing higher figures.

The former gang member fighting anti-Asian racism,"By George WrightBBC News In July, an 89-year-old Chinese woman was walking through her neighbourhood in Brooklyn, New York, when she was slapped and set on fire. The two people made away on foot as the elderly woman rubbed her back against a wall to put out the flames. News spread of the attack and it didn't take long to come to the attention of China Mac, a Chinese-American rapper from New York.  Mac, real name is Raymond Yu, decided enough was enough. ""That was home, this was right here, this is Brooklyn. I was watching the clip of her speaking in Cantonese and that's my language. I was hurt, I wanted to do something about it,"" he says. Attacks on East Asian people living in the US have shot up during the coronavirus pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate, a group which records reports of Covid-19 discrimination directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US, received 2,808 incidents of self-reported cases from the start of the pandemic to the end of the year.  ""I saw a comment saying: 'I bet China Mac isn't going to do anything about this', and I was like 'I actually would, and I am going to do something about this,'"" he says. Mac arranged They Can't Burn Us All protests across the US in a stand against the rise in anti-Asian racism. Leading a protest movement was just the latest step in a remarkable journey for Mac, a former gang member who was once jailed for attempted murder. China Mac was born in the early 1980s in New York to Chinese parents. His father, known locally as Fox, was a high-ranking member of the Flying Dragons gang, notorious in New York for trafficking heroin and its bloody turf war with their Chinese-American rivals, the Ghost Shadows. ""I saw the respect he got. I saw the admiration and fear people had of him. I saw things happening in Chinatown, dead bodies. I had to be very careful where I walked. I remember certain places I couldn't go to,"" Mac recalls.  Mac describes his early life as a ""bubble"" in Chinatown. His father wasn't around a lot and his mother, who spoke little English, had to raise Mac mostly on her own while working two jobs. ""I wanted to know him â¦ but I felt like he never really wanted to be with me,"" Mac says of his father.  A lot changed for Mac when his father was arrested, becoming a federal informant and passing over information about Johnny Eng, or Onionhead, the leader of the gang.  ""My father told on him. I remember the shift in the attitude towards me and my mother. Before it was like 'this is Fox's son' and people would open the door for me, I felt like royalty. But after that situation I felt the difference. My mom was scared to walk in certain places, she was always on alert,"" he says.  ""I remember seeing that and I didn't fully understand, but as time progressed I understood the kind of position my father put us in."" By the age of seven, Mac's mother was struggling as his behaviour deteriorated, and he was placed in a group home. This was a world far detached from the isolated upbringing he'd had in Chinatown. He soon realised that the only way to survive in a chaotic environment full of competing children was to fight.  It was here that he discovered hip-hop, realising it was a way to fit in. He spent hours memorising the lyrics to the likes of KRS One, Mobb Deep and LL Cool J. Mac would often recite lyrics in rap battles with other kids. ""I plagiarised it and I was rapping to people. They were like 'Whoa that's crazy' until they realised I was plagiarising, that didn't last too long,"" he laughs. ""But it was the feeling ... and I was like 'that's the response I need, that's what I want.'"" Mac eventually moved back in with his mother before running away. It was then, at the age of 12, he was recruited into the Ghost Shadows - the rivals of his father's former gang. Mac was soon deeply involved in the life that came with being a Ghost Shadow. He was in and out of juvenile detention centres as a teenager for various violent crimes, including robbery and assault.  Then in November 2003, Mac was involved in an incident that would change the course of his life.  Mac walked into a club in Chinatown and spotted MC Jin, a fellow Chinese-American rapper who was making waves in the world of hip-hop.  One of Mac's friends mentioned that Jin had allegedly disrespected one of their friends. Mac and his friend cornered Jin and a tussle broke out between the two groups. During the altercation someone shouted that one of Jin's associates, Christopher Louie, had a knife, Mac says.  Mac then pulled out a gun, aimed it at the back of Louie's head and pulled the trigger. The gun jammed. He shot a second time and a bullet hit Louie in the back.  ""I remember the gun jamming but I wasn't fully in control. While I was doing it, it was a blur, but I do remember what happened. Something else took over me,"" Mac says.  He left the club and spent the next year on the run.  Mac spent the year moving between New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Detroit and Kalamazoo in Michigan. He spent a period living in student houses at Albany University and Georgia Tech, committing robberies and petty crime to get by. Then, one day, somebody passed him a copy of Blender magazine featuring an article about the shooting and Mac's mug shot.  Mac tried to flee to Canada, but was spotted at the border. The game was up.  He was taken to Rikers Island, one of the country's most infamous prisons.  ""Rikers Island was a zoo. It was dangerous there. My classification was super high. I was in the housing areas where everyone was facing life, murder charges, big charges,"" he recalls. ""I understood Rikers Island. I was fighting all the time, cutting people, always in trouble. It's the culture, we would fight over anything."" Facing life behind bars, Mac saw little point in changing his behaviour. But when the trial came, his lawyer delivered a presentation about Mac's life and how he was a product of his environment. The judge handed him an 11-year jail term.  One day a few years into his sentence, Mac's mother came to visit him in Sing Sing jail, where he was then incarcerated. She cried throughout the visit, while Mac helplessly tried to comfort her. Back in his cell, Mac broke down in tears. A prisoner sweeping the floor outside leaned on the bars to the cell. ""He said: 'I saw you on the visiting floor and I saw your mother.' At the time he had 27 years in prison,"" Mac recalls.  ""He said: 'I remember when that happened to me, my mother has passed away since then. I just want you to know this doesn't have to define you. This doesn't have to be your last stop. You can turn this into more prison time, or you can use this as a university. You have all the time in the world to learn about whatever you want to learn, to fix whatever you want to fix.""  Mac decided it was time to make a change. He started to read and enrolled in every program he could. He even featured in the HBO documentary University of Sing Sing.  Mac was eventually released in 2013. He launched a record label, Red Money Records, and opened a pet store that his mother now runs. He started dropping freestyle raps, including one called 0 to 100 that went viral.  After getting recalled to jail for just over a year for violating his probation curfew, upon his release his music started getting more traction. He even recorded a song with one of his heroes, Method Man from Wu Tang Clan. He released his debut album MITM in 2017.  Mac started branching out as his social media following grew to hundreds of thousands. His YouTube show, Mac Eats, where he takes viewers on food tours of New York, was a big hit with fans. An interview with Mac and Jin, where they discuss the night of the shooting for the first time, racked up 1.5 million views. Then Covid came.  Soon after Covid-19 was detected in Wuhan, China, racist abuse started to get hurled at many Asian-Americans. Many accused then-President Donald Trump of adding fuel to the flames with incendiary language, including calling it the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"". In California, an elderly man collecting cans was threatened with an iron bar as he wept, and a teenager was taken to hospital after being physically assaulted. In Texas, an Asian family, including a two-year-old and six-year-old, were stabbed in a supermarket.  ""I was just seeing things online. Videos were being circulated and I saw the man with the cans in San Francisco. I did a video saying that we will raise money for the man. I wanted to do something about it,"" Mac says.  Then the elderly woman was attacked in Brooklyn. He felt it was time to stand up.  Mac arranged They Can't Burn Us All protests with actor and producer William Lex Ham. Rallies took place in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, with many Asian-Americans turning out. Mac said he took inspiration from the civil rights movement of the 1960s. ""People had to sacrifice, people had to stand up, people had to fight, people had to be uncomfortable. Imagine what Martin Luther King felt at that time? Imagine what Malcolm X felt?"" he says.   ""Asian people don't have that, there's not enough of it, we haven't had that fight yet. I'm not saying there weren't Asian people who were a part of that movement, there were. But it wasn't the majority. We haven't really stood up and fought for our own yet.""  Mac says it was time to use his fight for a positive cause. ""We're not going to take it and we're ready to fight. You're not going to do this to us. That's something I learned in prison, I learned to stand up for myself,"" he says.  Although the They Can't Burn Us All movement has been a success, Mac admits it could have been better organised. Despite leading a protest movement, Mac emphatically refutes the suggestion he's now a political activist. ""I'm not an activist man. I like to go to the strip club. I like to be in the hood. I'm not built for the political s---,"" he says.  ""But I am built to fight for my people."" Looking to the future, Mac says he finds himself in ""difficult times"", without elaborating. He says he wants to keep bettering himself and ""his people"". ""I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow. All I know is that I can stay the course,"" he says.  The next day, Mac wiped his Instagram and deleted most of his music from YouTube. In a post, titled I QUIT MUSIC, he said that he had ""reached his ceiling"". This week, he travelled to San Francisco Bay Area  and took to the streets after reports of more attacks on the Asian community.  Whether Mac heeds calls from his fans to return to music remains to be seen, but whatever he chooses next, his journey has been an extraordinary one.

The cinemas now hiring out their screens to gamers,"By Je Seung LeeBusiness reporter Eui Jeong Lee and three of her friends sit in an otherwise empty 200-seat cinema auditorium and play a video game on the giant screen. As Ms Lee blasts her gaming opponents with her wireless controller, the sound whips loudly around the dark room from the numerous cinema speakers. ""The sound quality is particularly amazing,"" says the 25-year-old student.  ""The sound of the gunshots is just so vivid, and when something flew directly at me from the screen I even screamed."" Ms Lee and her mates had hired the screen for two hours at a branch of South Korea's largest cinema chain, CGV. With many cinemas across the country closed due to coronavirus restrictions meaning that they can only open with 50% capacity, and far fewer movies being released to tempt cinemagoers, CGV came up with the idea of renting out its auditoriums to gamers to bring in a new revenue stream. Before 6pm up to four people can hire a screen for two hours for around $90 (Â£65). This then rises to $135 in the evening. Users have to bring their consoles, games and controllers with them. The auditoriums being hired out have between 100 and 200 seats, and by comparison CGV movie tickets cost around $12 each. So a 100-seat screen half filled for a film would bring in revenues of $600, rising to $1,200 for a 200-seat one at 50% capacity. And that is before the filmgoers buy their drinks and popcorn. Yet while CGV isn't making anywhere as much money from the gamers, it is bringing in some additional income. The scheme is called Azit-X after ""azit"", the Korean word for hideout. CGV employee Seung Woo Han came up with the idea after he realised that films and video games share many similarities. ""When thinking about how to make use of empty cinema spaces, I noticed that games nowadays boast excellent graphics and well structured stories just like movies,"" he says. ""Both have a storytelling aspect to them, so if someone can enjoy watching a film in the cinema, I thought they would also enjoy playing computer games in one."" Since the new service launched at the start of this year, auditoriums have been booked more than 130 times so far. While the majority of customers are said to be men in their 30s or 40s, couples and families have also taken part. The extent to which the global cinema industry has been devastated by the Covid-19 pandemic makes grim reading. Global ticket sales in 2020 plunged 71% to $12.4bn (Â£8.9bn) down from $42.5bn in 2019, according to movie industry trade magazine Variety. In the US, the country's largest cinema chain, AMC Theatres, needed a $917m cash injection in December to see off reports that it risked having to seek bankruptcy protection. Meanwhile, in the UK last month, leading British film-makers called on the government to offer financial support to the country's big cinema chains. Korea's CGV is not the only cinema chain now letting gamers book cinema screens, as US group Malco Theatres has been doing the same since November. Memphis-based Malco allows up to 20 people to hire a screen at its 36 cinemas across Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Tennessee. The prices for service, which is called Malco Select, are $100 for two hours or $150 for three. Karen Melton, vice president and director of marketing at Malco, has mixed emotions: ""It is gaining traction, and is becoming popular, but nothing is adding to our profitability at this point."" Other US chains, such as AMC and Cinemark, have been allowing customers in small groups to book auditoriums for private screenings. Back in South Korea, CGV is also making money by allowing customers to order its cinema food to be delivered, everything from popcorn or nachos, to corndogs (deep-fried sausages) and calamari.  New Economy is a new series exploring how businesses, trade, economies and working life are changing fast. ""People who miss our foods and have fond memories of eating their favourite cinema foods while watching movies in cinemas want to relive the experience at home instead,"" says CGV spokesman Seon Hyeon Park. ""Our popcorns have a range of flavours; from caramel, basil and onion, to double cheese. They are different from the ones you can buy from shops and supermarkets, as we make our own popcorn, and our menu has been developed from years of research."" In the UK, cinemas are closed to cinemagoers due to the latest lockdown restrictions, but one branch of the Odeon chain, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire has been turned into a temporary Covid-19 vaccination centre. Meanwhile, in east London, art house cinema Genesis has kept its cafÃ© open so that people can buy takeaways. Tyrone Walker-Hebborn, the cinema's owner, says the pandemic has been disastrous for both cinemas and the wider film industry. ""It's been the most difficult period I've ever known in my 21 years in the industry,"" he says. ""And it has potentially damaged the film industry forever. ""We basically have not traded for a year now, and I think there are few businesses who can survive that."" Yet Mr Walker-Hebborn remains confident for the longer term: ""I'm extremely optimistic about the future of cinema, and not only do I think cinemas will survive the pandemic, I believe they are a necessary community cornerstone for people to heal from the pandemic. ""I think that in the main it will return to how it was pre-pandemic, but I do think it's going to take [all of] 2021 for it to return to pretty much where it was.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55994767,1
William and Kate praise NI nursing students,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have praised student nurses from Northern Ireland on front-line placements during the Covid-19 pandemic. Their Royal Highnesses video-called students from Ulster University's School of Nursing on Tuesday. The Royal couple spoke to Abigail McGarvey, a first year student, about a video diary she made on her placement.  ""It was absolutely mad, they were so, so lovely and so easy to talk to,"" the 18-year-old told BBC News NI.  Ms McGarvey created her video diary to demonstrate what a typical shift on the front line was like for student nurses.  In the footage, she is seen getting up for a night shift, travelling to work and putting on personal protective equipment (PPE). ð¥ For nursing students, studying and undertaking placements during the pandemic has been a challenge like no other.The Duke and Duchess spoke with @UlsterUni nursing student Abigail about her experiences of working on the frontline of the #COVID19 response in Northern Ireland. pic.twitter.com/ntxXxdtkET In March 2020, many students studying medicine courses across the UK graduated early to help meet the demands on the health service during the Covid-19 pandemic. Student placements were also adapted, with many students sent to work in both Covid-19 areas in hospitals and community settings.  The adult nursing student, who is on placement at Causeway Hospital, was asked by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge about her video diary and the many challenges she and fellow students were experiencing on their placements.  Ms McGarvey said she found families being unable to visit their loved ones in hospital particularly difficult.  ""It was obviously just so hard with patients not being able to see their families - they get so much emotional support from their families. ""Them not being able to have visiting hours and all, it just means we really had to step up even more. ""We had to make sure that we're there for them on their hard days and their good days as well."" The student nurse also talked about her experience of starting university during a pandemic, and the impact Covid-19 has had on her ability to socialise and learn during lockdown with fellow students. ""It was just a wee bit harder not really having many friends on my course because I haven't been able to see them, so not really having the support from people who are going through the same thing. ""It's just mad how everything has kicked off so fast. I've got a class in the morning, I'm sitting with my textbooks around me. ""They (the Royal couple) were saying that it was just amazing that I'm 18 and going in to do this - especially during a pandemic."" Ms McGarvey, who hopes to one day become a children's nurse, said her placement has ""completely confirmed"" that this is what she wants to do as a career in the future.

Vaccinations of care staff 'lagging behind target',"By Alison HoltSocial Affairs Correspondent, BBC News There is a worrying shortfall in the number of care staff to have had Covid vaccinations, a survey of almost 1,500 services in the UK suggests.  Nearly half of care homes for older people have more than 30% of staff who are as yet unvaccinated, according to the research from earlier this week.    And uptake for staff supporting people in their own homes and those working with younger adults is even lower. A target of 15 February has been set to vaccinate all front-line care workers. But only half the care homes for older people to respond to the survey by the National Care Forum, which represents not-for-profit care providers across the UK but mainly in England, had more than 70% of staff vaccinated. And this was the case in just: The survey also confirms staff hesitancy is a significant factor in the slow uptake. Other reasons include:   The Department of Health and Social Care said it was ""on track"" to meet its target of offering a first dose of a vaccine to all frontline social care workers in England by mid-February. A spokesman added: ""The Covid-19 vaccine rollout is the biggest vaccination programme in NHS history, and so far our heroic health and care staff have vaccinated more people than every country in Europe put together. ""Health and social care staff are playing crucial roles on the frontline of this pandemic and their employers are in the process of contacting them to make sure they get their vaccine as soon as possible."" Low uptake among staff at his wife's care home is a source of major concern for Trevor Salomon, from London, particularly as he says almost a third of the home's residents died with the virus last year. He and his wife, Yvonne, who has Alzheimer's disease, have had the vaccine. And he hopes it will at least protect them from severe symptoms.  But only about half the staff have had the jab. ""What makes me sad... is that they have been influenced by what they've seen, read or heard on social media,"" he says. ""My anger is very much directed at those people who post misinformation and lies about the vaccine."" The situation is slowly improving, though, Mr Salomon says, as staff see colleagues being vaccinated without side-effects, ""so more are coming forward"".   At the Saffron House nursing home, in Bristol, housekeeper Monika Szwolko was nervous the vaccine was ""too new"" and about who would care for her children if she had side-effects.  But having been persuaded to have the vaccine and had no side-effects, she is keen to recommend it to colleagues.  ""I feel like I've done something good,"" she tells BBC News. ""There is nothing to be scared of."" Verona Thomas, a unit manager at the home, was also deterred by the speed with which the vaccine was developed - and what she read on social media about potential side-effects.  But worrying about what would happen to loved ones if she caught the virus changed her mind. Also, she says: ""I work with quite vulnerable adults. ""I provide care for them.  ""So it was a case of doing my best to protect them."" National Care Forum executive director Vic Rayner said the survey ""would appear to indicate that there are big groups of people who haven't been anywhere near vaccination yet. ""And to get them done within the next five days seems like a bit of a mountain to climb,"" she added.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-56012869,1
Ministers in a summer holiday tangle,"Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor@bbclaurakon Twitter In normal times, you probably wouldn't think it's any business of a politician's to tell you when, or when not, to book a summer holiday.  On a freezing February night, what better cheering activity is there than to hunt for bargains that promise sunnier climes months way? The pandemic, of course, has changed all that - you can look still, but you may well not want to book. International travel is very heavily restricted. Even leaving your own home is only allowed for limited and specific reasons.  So whether you'll be heading for a lounger in six months time is, like it or not, part of the government's responsibility. And the chances of going away will depend, not just on how the disease has shifted at home, but also how other countries have handled it abroad.  Yet still, with progress being made, cases falling, and the government pointing to the start of March as the hoped for beginning of the end of this lockdown, the transport secretary's remarks on Wednesday morning jumped out of the radio.  Grant Shapps warned that it was too early, not just to book a holiday abroad, but also a holiday at home.  Sources suggest that he was really just exercising natural caution at a very unpredictable time, but by doing so, we entered what has become a very familiar classic Covid situation.  Mr Shapps said don't book anything. But his colleague, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, had previously told the world that he was looking forward to a happy ""Great British Summer"", and had booked his holiday to Cornwall.  In turn, the prime minister had earlier said that he was ""optimistic"" about the prospects for summer breaks, even though he added plenty of caveats.  At Wednesday's Downing Street press conference, when asked for a second time, Boris Johnson said that it was too early to be sure.  But at the same time, Mr Hancock was talking to a group of MPs on a video call. Responding to questions, he repeated his own plans to head to the South West.  You would be forgiven for wondering then, as a would be holidaymaker, what you are meant to do? One former minister tried to translate what they meant, suggesting: ""Bottom line on holiday gate: travel abroad this year is unlikely. Holidays within the UK *are* likely by the summer, but the government can't make a hard and fast statement to this effect at this stage. ""If you book (as I have), you do so at your own risk."" Having talked to sources in government about what is likely, that is not a bad guess. But it is, very much, a guess. Which brings us to the second classic Covid situation.  Ministers' remarks clash with each other - in emphasis or fact sometimes - because they just do not know exactly what the situation will be, so they have no solid decision to explain. And if they don't know, well there's not much they can tell us.  There is a separate conversation about just how vital clarity in government communications is during a public health crisis, whether ministers stick to exactly the same script is a matter that can affect life and death.  There are also ways for experienced politicians to not answer questions, even if it makes some people shout at the telly or turn off the radio.  But when it comes to looking more than a few weeks into the future, in the way that we all want to, all too often, ministers have ended up in a tangle. That is one of the reasons why the PM, during this lockdown, has been noticeably more cautious about what might come next.  It's one of the reasons too why a couple of weeks ago he announced his intention to publish a plan on 22 February. It gives the government a bit of breathing space to work out exactly what it wants to do, rather than ending up in some of the situations they have faced previously that have caused huge frustration - like some boroughs finding out about entering new tiers of regulations with only a few hours to go.  In this instance, that plan may not even give detail about holidays, still many months away. On current expectations, schools in England are likely to open their gates to all pupils again on 8 March.  If the disease is being squeezed in the way ministers hope by then, it's likely some outdoor sports and some more socialising outside could return too.  But it doesn't seem that the next level of reopening, whether getting clients back in the hairdressers' chair, fitness enthusiasts back in the gym or punters back sharing a few drinks in a beer garden, is likely until April onwards.  And underline all of that with heavy black ink - it is dependent on what happens with the disease.  I've written before that there is a reluctance in government to have to close the doors again. And that conviction seems to be getting stronger, not weaker, with one insider telling me: ""Literally the worst thing we can do is lockdown four.""  Caution in No 10 seems to be very firmly bedded in, and with the very real possibility of booster vaccinations being required later in the year, the practical effects of the disease aren't going to disappear fast.   There are massive concerns in the travel industry about losing another summer. Frustration perhaps too among many families eager for a spot of sun, or to know they can go and visit family abroad.  But as in many areas of life right now, the government isn't willing, and maybe not really able, to give a guarantee.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56019851,1
"Have your jab this week, PM tells two million","Boris Johnson has urged the two million people yet to take up their offer of a Covid jab to ""come forward"" this week. The UK was closing in on Monday's target for vaccinating almost 15 million of its most vulnerable people, the PM told a Downing Street briefing. But he said some people ""for one reason or another"" had not been vaccinated. Mr Johnson said the aim was not to ""hit some numerical target, but to save lives... another step on the long and hard road back to normality"". The government is aiming to offer a first dose of a vaccine to 15 million people - those aged 70 and over, healthcare workers and people required to shield - by 15 February. After the first four priority groups receive their jabs, ministers hope that people aged 50 and over, as well as those with underlying health conditions will be vaccinated by the end of April. As of Tuesday 13,058,298 had received a first vaccine dose, a daily rise of 411,812. Mr Johnson said: ""With less than a week to go until the target date... there's no doubt we've made great strides, with just over 13 million people now vaccinated in our United Kingdom, including one in four adults in England, over 90% of everyone over 75 and over 90% of eligible residents of care homes for the elderly. ""But that still leaves nearly two million people, a population roughly twice the size of Birmingham, that we still hope to reach. ""And there are people across the country who for one reason or another haven't yet taken up their offer. So now is the moment to do it."" Mr Johnson appealed to care workers who still have not been vaccinated to contact their employer to ""fix it up"". His comments came after a survey suggested more than 30% of staff in nearly half of all care homes for older people have not been vaccinated. The government is on track to meet its target to offer vaccines to 15 million people by Monday. But the question now on everyone's lips is what difference is it making? Given it takes two to three weeks for immunity to develop and then another few weeks for the impact of that to be seen in infection levels and hospitalisations, it is too early to tell for sure from the published data. The government has been collecting data behind the scenes by monitoring cases in people who have been vaccinated.  It is expected to unveil that next week.  Early reports suggest it is having a significant difference - and if that is the case it will shift the dynamics of the pandemic significantly. The latest official figures on Covid also show there have been a further 1,001 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the UK, and another 13,013 positive tests. This compares to 1,322 deaths and 19,202 cases reported a week ago. Mr Johnson acknowledged that the figures showing a reduction in Covid-19 cases were not necessarily down to the rollout of the vaccine. The prime minister said: ""I've looked at the data and scrutinised it with my layman's eye and so far, yes we are getting the numbers down, but can I see results that I think are directly attributable to the vaccine? Although I'm assured that will happen soon, I can't say that I can see them yet."" The UK's chief medical adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the briefing there were still a ""significant number of people in high-risk groups"" who had not been vaccinated and the lifting of restrictions in England needed to take place with ""caution."" Sir Patrick said: ""Those people remain at risk and so it's important we go cautiously in opening up, in order to be able to measure the effects."" Sir Patrick was asked about Covid lateral flow tests (LFTs) as they began to be rolled out to more workplaces. He said they were a ""really important part of our toolkit"", and while not as ""sensitive"" as a PCR lab test, were ""good with picking up people with high viral load, who are most infectious"", and who are asymptomatic. Mr Johnson says LFTs will ""come into their own"" once the economy is starting to ""unlock"". ""They do have a very clear use case but it's in conjunction with everything we are doing and the priority is obviously vaccination.""

Special schools vaccine priority 'not supported',"By Robbie MeredithBBC News NI Education Correspondent The Department of Health did not support a proposal to vaccinate all special school staff against Covid-19, according to the education minister. Peter Weir said the executive had been ""reluctant"" to hold a vote on the plan. As a result, only specific staff who care for clinically vulnerable children will be prioritised for vaccination. Mr Weir also told Stormont's Education Committee that special school principals would have to decide which staff should be vaccinated. Sinn FÃ©in MLA Nicola Brogan asked Mr Weir why all staff in special schools were not getting priority for the vaccine. ""We've been contacted by a number of special school principals who have said since the announcement that they have been given responsibility to choose which staff within their schools received the vaccine,"" she said. The minister agreed that special school principals had been put ""in a difficult position"". ""I think it would make sense to offer it to all staff, that would be my position,"" Mr Weir said. ""I put a paper to the executive which indicated that my preference was for all special school staff. ""Health made it very clear that they were not prepared to support something which they felt went against the JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) which suggested therefore that they would be opposed to simply something which at this stage rolled it out across everybody. ""There was not, I suppose, across the full range of the executive a willingness to put that to a vote and outvote health in that regard, there was a desire to have consensus."" Mr Weir added: ""If it was purely left up to me, would I vaccinate every special school staff member - yes I would. ""But I don't have a stash of the vaccine in that regard. We can only work with what is agreed by health."" But Mr Weir said that was a ""better option"" than having no special school staff vaccinated at all. A Department of Education official, Ricky Irwin, told the committee that work to identify which staff would get the vaccine was ongoing. ""The staff that would receive the vaccine would be those who are directly involved in the care of children and young people with the most complex healthcare needs and who are deemed clinically vulnerable to the severe effects of Covid,"" he said. ""So it would be those who work in close proximity for prolonged periods of time providing a range of interventions which would include personal and intimate care. ""We have a list of those clinical procedures that those staff would be involved in. That is, at this point, a health-led process."" MLAs were also told that there was no evidence that it would be in the best interests of children for them all to repeat an entire school year. It had been suggested by some principals and organisations as an option due to disruption to education caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The vast majority of pupils have only spent four months in class since last March. Janis Scallon, from the Department of Education, told the committee that there had been ""a lot of scoping done"" on all pupils in Northern Ireland repeating a year. ""Educationally, when you look at international research and local research there is no concrete evidence base that would suggest that it would be in the best educational interests of all children to repeat an educational year in a wholesale type approach,"" she said. ""Some of that evidence would suggest that it could potentially have a negative impact. That's not to say that for some individual children it might be the right thing to do."" Mr Weir also said that the proposal would cause many problems but that parents could ask schools if their children could repeat a year - though it would be down to principals and boards of governors to make those decisions. But the committee chair, Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle, queried the value of the research cited by Ms Scallon. ""I presume none of that research has ever been conducted on the basis of a global pandemic that has disrupted up to six months learning of an entire year cohort?"" he said.

Senedd gives itself option of delaying May election,"The Welsh Parliament has given itself the ability to delay May's election by up to six months. Polling day can be postponed from 6 May if the pandemic stops voting going ahead safely. Two-thirds of Senedd members would have to approve any new dates proposed. Ministers say they do not want a delay, but coronavirus creates ""significant uncertainty about what the public health situation will be like in May"". ""That's why we've acted now to respond to the potential risks to the election arising from the pandemic,"" Local Government Minister Julie James said after the Senedd passed emergency legislation on Wednesday. The Welsh Elections Coronavirus Bill allows the date of the election to be moved until 5 November.  Under the law the first minister would propose a delay if he felt one was needed - it would be up to the presiding officer of the Senedd to pick a date, before politicians vote on the proposal. The bill also allows anyone who is self-isolating to nominate a proxy voter to cast a ballot on their behalf. Conservatives did not support the bill, saying there needed to be criteria about the severity of the pandemic before the first minister can formally request a delay.

Prison 'struggling' amid Covid outbreak,"A Covid outbreak at Winchester Prison is leaving staff ""struggling"" and ""under pressure"". The BBC understands about 80 prisoners have Covid - a fifth of all inmates. About 20 staff have also tested positive. One elderly prisoner with Covid, who had underlying health problems, recently died in hospital. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation in the prison. The Prison Officers Association (POA) said staff who were not ill or having to self-isolate were doing a lot of extra hours, and were stressed and tired. Sarah Rigby, of the POA, said staff were ""really feeling the pressure"" and were worried about their ill colleagues.  ""Morale is struggling,"" she said.  ""Staff are getting tired because they're being asked to extend their shifts all the time. ""Some of the landings are so narrow you can't fit two people side by side walking on some of these landings, so how can you socially distance, really? You can't, can you? So they have got it against them in that respect."" A Prison Service spokesman said: ""Our priority is to limit the spread of the virus and protect the lives of those who live and work in our prisons. ""We have taken precautionary measures and are closely monitoring the situation at Winchester."" He said all prison staff were routinely tested, along with new prisoners and transfers, to isolate those who test positive before they show symptoms. Angus Somerville of the Independent Monitoring Board said Winchester was one of the last closed prisons in the region to have an outbreak. He said: ""Men are not allowed out of their cells for very extended periods of time... but I think everything's being done that can be done."" HMP Winchester has two parts - a category B Victorian prison, holding up to 561 prisoners, and the smaller West Hill site with about 130 category C inmates.

One million people in Scotland receive vaccine,"More than one million people have received their first dose of the Covid vaccine in Scotland.  The Scottish government said the milestone was reached on Wednesday and the vaccination programme was now moving ""at pace"".  Ministers say they are on track to inoculate everyone in the top priority groups - including everyone aged over 70 - by 15 February They had been criticised for a sluggish start to the vaccine drive. But opposition parties have welcomed the increased pace of the vaccine rollout in the last week.  The milestone means more than a fifth (22%) of the 4.5m people who will be offered the jab have received it.  Retired businessman John Loch was among those being immunised at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow as the landmark figure was reached.  The 69-year-old from Bearsden received his first dose at the hospital which was set up at the Scottish Exhibition Centre.  ""I am delighted to have received my vaccine, particularly on the day Scotland reached a million doses. It is exciting to be a part of this milestone moment. ""I would like to thank all the staff at the Louisa Jordan for being so reassuring and making the process so simple and straightforward."" The speed of the rollout began increasing significantly following the opening of mass vaccination sites at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre, P&J Live in Aberdeen and other large venues across the country.  On Monday more than 61,000 people were vaccinated - the highest daily figure so far and one that was described by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon as a ""pretty whopping increase"".  The figure reported on Wednesday dipped slightly to 57,447, but that is likely to be partly because of the severe weather in some parts of the country.  Health Secretary Jeane Freeman acknowledged the ""important milestone"" but warned about an expected ""dip in supplies"" towards the end of February.  ""Scotland's Covid-19 vaccination programme is delivering ahead of our expectations,"" she said.  ""Our aim is to vaccinate as many people as possible with both their first and second doses as quickly as possible, but the speed at which we can do this depends on supply and we expect a dip in supplies UK-wide towards the end of this month. ""We hope to see a significant drop in the disease due to the vaccination programme, however this will take a number of months to evaluate fully.  ""In the shorter term, we are monitoring the uptake rate but we also have a comprehensive surveillance system in place to monitor the outcome of vaccine efficacy and disease reduction."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said it was ""great news"" that the pace of the vaccine rollout had picked up.  ""I hope we can soon catch up with the rest of the UK,"" he tweeted.  ""Incredible to see the hard work of NHS staff and our armed forces paying off. A real Scottish and UK success story.""

NI must 'tread carefully' to end Covid lockdown,"NI must ""tread carefully"" when it comes to easing the coronavirus lockdown and some restrictions may remain in place long term, Robin Swann has said. The health minister said that despite progress with vaccinations, serious uncertainties remain about the future. His comments came amid warnings from health officials that some restrictions could remain in place until next year. ""If we want a better spring and summer, we need to make the utmost effort now,"" added Mr Swann. Northern Ireland re-entered lockdown on 26 December, as hospitals faced severe pressures in managing a third wave of the virus. The executive will review the restrictions next week but the measures are currently in place until 5 March. Four more coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in Northern Ireland, according to the Department of Health. A total number of 1,957 people have now died in Northern Ireland after testing positive for the virus. A further 336 positive coronavirus cases were also recorded on Wednesday in the department's latest figures. There are 554 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland, 61 are in intensive care units (ICU). There are 554 people being treated in hospital for the virus in Northern Ireland, 61 are in intensive care units (ICU). Speaking at the weekly health press conference at Stormont on Wednesday, Mr Swann said he wanted to offer people hope but had to ""stress the need for caution"". Wearing face coverings in shops and on public transport may remain the ""new normal"" even if lockdown measures are eased, he added. ""If we continue with the progress we are making, we can consider a careful, managed, easing of some measures - but only when and if the timing is right,"" Mr Swann warned. The minister set out three ""principles"" he said would guide the executive's response to easing restrictions in the coming months. They are: Mr Swann said he wanted to ""aggressively stamp down"" infection rates, in order to allow breathing space for all aspects of society to recover. On new variants of the virus, he said they represented a considerable unknown and that ministers could not prematurely end lockdown and risk ""falling into another in a small number of weeks"". It is believed at least 50% of current Covid-19 cases in NI could be related to the variant that was detected in Kent before Christmas. It is thought to be about 50-70% more infectious than the original Covid-19 strain that emerged early last year. He pointed to upcoming St Patrick's Day and Easter holidays and said history could not repeat itself by allowing increased social mixing to cause a large spike in cases.  Mr Swann said he longed for the day when all families in Northern Ireland could enjoy freedoms they previously took for granted, but stressed ""we are not there yet"". Wednesday's Department of Health press briefing was a cooling of the jets after comments by Dr Michael McBride on Tuesday which left some thinking we would be living in lockdown well into next year.  Dr McBride and the health minister made it clear that ""some restrictions may be with us into the long term"" but that did not mean lockdown is here to stay.  With the public hanging onto every word during these dark times, clarity in these press conferences is essential. Never before have words, dates and timings been so forensically scrutinised.  Wednesday's message was about stepping out of this lockdown ""slowly and gently"", ""baby steps"" rather than giant leaps.  While both men acknowledged that the public are ""fed-up"" and ""weary"" they also recognised we cannot be led out of one lockdown so quickly that ""we end up falling into another in a matter of weeks"". St Patrick's Day and Easter are social stumbling blocks. While it's the executive who will decide what happens next, the minister said history must not be allowed to repeat itself (a nudge to re-opening at Christmas). Considering that it's likely health officials will advise that very little will re-open before Easter, the big question is if that that will include schools. With several sectors in the mix, including education, hospitality and close contact services, the plan, it seems, is to open one at a time and measure the success or damage before proceeding with the next. All eyes will be on the R number - the aim is always to keep it below 1. As the gentlemen both said, it will be slow and gentle baby steps.  As of Tuesday, 361,430 doses of the vaccine had been administered in Northern Ireland. The minister said the vaccination programme was making ""real progress"" and more than 90% of people aged over 80 in NI have now received a dose, along with 80% of those aged 75 to 79. Northern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said no-one was advocating for a full lockdown to continue until 2022. ""We can do better than that, and we must do better than that,"" he told the press conference. But he warned that if restrictions were relaxed too early, cases would grow and that would lead to further pressures on the health service and another rise in deaths. ""We need to allow time between relaxing one thing, assessing the impact of that before then relaxing another,"" said Dr McBride. He added that ""small, careful baby steps"" were required, but insisted ""there will be a time after Covid"". Both Dr McBride and Mr Swann appealed to the public to continue following the current public health advice, insisting it would remain an important part of the strategy to manage Covid-19. Meanwhile in the Republic of Ireland on Wednesday, an additional 54 deaths were added to official figures on Wednesday, bringing the country's overall toll of coronavirus-related deaths to 3,794.  Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team also said there have been another 1,006 confirmed cases of Covid-19.

"Don't book holiday yet, government warns","People in the UK should not be booking holidays at home or abroad yet due to coronavirus, the transport secretary has told the BBC. Grant Shapps admitted he did not know ""where we'll be"" by the summer. Boris Johnson said he hoped to provide ""clarity"" on possible lockdown easing later this month, but the public would need to be ""a ""little more patient"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of sending ""mixed messages"" on whether holidays can happen. And, in an impassioned attack on the government's position, senior Conservative MP Sir Charles Walker implored the prime minister to give people ""something to look forward to"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""We had summer holidays last year when we didn't have a vaccine. Now we've got vaccines coming out of our ears, we are told, 'Don't book a summer holiday,' for crying out loud."" Under lockdown rules, holiday travel is banned in the UK, but a fall in coronavirus cases has fuelled hopes of a return to relative normality by spring or summer. However, Mr Shapps said: ""Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer. ""It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage."" Who should people believe? Ministers promising a great British summer or those telling them not to book their place by a pool quite yet? I imagine most people have more pressing questions - such as when they might see their grandchildren again or get to have a cup of tea with their mum. But it's a question that tests how the people running the country see the coming weeks and months. At the moment, caution is the watchword in government. Boris Johnson is desperate to ensure that this lockdown is the last but uncertainty runs through their calculations. Right now, ministers can't offer simple answers to questions that this time last year would have sounded absurd.  Speaking at the Downing Street coronavirus press conference, the prime minister said there was ""not an awful long"" time between now and his Covid-recovery ""road map"" being delivered on 22 February. ""I hope we will be able to get some more clarity by then. ""I understand why people want to make plans now, but we are just going to have to be a little more patient."" Holidays abroad and in the UK restarted last summer, after the first lockdown ended. For Labour, Sir Keir told the BBC it was ""very difficult to predict"" the situation the summer, but the government should ""stop putting out mixed messages"". ""The prime minister was saying one week that he's 'optimistic' about holidays, then he's got the transport secretary saying, 'Don't book a holiday.' ""That isn't helping businesses. It's not helping families."" The data organisation Statista found that in 2019 - before the pandemic struck - UK spending on trips abroad totalled Â£62.3bn. And Visit Britain estimates that UK people who holidayed in England during that period spent Â£19.5bn. The travel industry, which has been severely hit by coronavirus, reacted with dismay to Mr Shapps's comments. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us."" And EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said airlines would be monitoring the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants of the virus. ""Most important now is that the government comes out with a plan on how they're going to unwind these restrictions,"" he told an online aviation conference.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-56008363,1
"Mass vaccination hub 'under-utilised', MP claims","An MP has claimed a mass vaccination hub, with capacity for 1,500 people every day, is being ""under-utilised"".  Tobias Ellwood said GPs were ""discouraging"" patients from using the Bournemouth International Centre (BIC) so they could receive payments for administering the jabs. The BMA said the payments of Â£12.58 per jab were to cover GP practice costs. The MP has suggested the government allows other age groups to access the vaccine to make full use of the centre. Mr Ellwood, Conservative MP for Bournemouth East, started volunteering at the BIC after it opened as a vaccination centre on 18 January. He said it was ""really frustrating"" that volunteers were being sent home early due to a lack of bookings.  ""There is in fact an argument if you like, a battle between the GPs, who are saying 'don't go to the BIC', discouraging them to get their jab there.  ""And when we learn why, it's because of course because the GPs get paid Â£20 per jab."" He added that GPs ""need to wake up and recognise that we need to work together"".  GPs receive Â£12.58 per jab - not the Â£20 cited by Mr Ellwood - which the BMA said covered practice costs, such as additional staff hours and consumables. Dr Karen Kirkham, clinical lead for the Dorset vaccination programme, said hubs like the BIC were ""dependent on patient activity through the national booking system"" and that everyone in the NHS was ""working tirelessly"".  She added: ""Many patients across Dorset are choosing to access their vaccination through their local GP-run services, which have been up and running since the middle of December, vaccinating almost every day and weekend to support the local population."" In a statement, the British Medical Association's (BMA) GP committee, said: ""We know that the vast majority of patients are being vaccinated at their own GP practice or one close by.  ""It's very much down to patient choice, for example, the current cohort being vaccinated are generally elderly or clinically vulnerable patients, who are often more comfortable and familiar visiting their GP practice. ""Mr Ellwood's comments may highlight broader issues of co-ordination within the wider system that should be addressed.  ""This is about a joint effort which should be focused on improving the uptake across the board to get as many people vaccinated as possible - not moving them from one service to another.""

Covid-breach gym to contest closure order,"A gym owner who has been accused of repeatedly breaching coronavirus regulations will contest a closure order, a court has heard.  Police raided Prophecy Performance Centre in Liverpool on Sunday and found more than 50 people inside. Owner Nathan De Asha told Liverpool Magistrates' Court he and other gym members were ""manhandled, mauled and abused"" by police. The gym was given two prohibition orders in previous lockdowns. Gyms have been forced to close during the latest national coronavirus lockdown. Liverpool City Council had applied for a closure order as the gym on Gaskill Road in Speke had remained open despite the national lockdown, the court heard. Cecilia Pritchard, prosecuting, said members of the public had made at least 35 reports about the gym in January and this ""culminated"" in an incident on Sunday. She said there was a ""significant issue of disorder"" and police and firefighters had attended and those found at the gym had ""for a period been locked in"". Ms Pritchard said: ""Despite all of the previous interventions the gym itself appears to still be operating. ""The concern is if it remained open, which in and of itself is already in breach of coronavirus legislation, it is likely there will be future disorder or criminal conduct on or near the premises."" Mr De Asha asked for the case to be adjourned for his legal representative to attend and said he would call witnesses to give evidence on the ""brutality"" of the incident with police. He also asked that he and builders carrying out work to the site were still allowed to attend the premises.  District Judge James Clarke adjourned the case to Sefton Magistrates' Court on 22 February. He extended a temporary closure notice but said Mr De Asha would be allowed to access the premises.  Merseyside Police Deputy Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said in Sunday's incident ""the use of force was judged necessary by officers in response to people's behaviour"". She said officers should not be ""confronted with abuse and violence when attempting to uphold the law"".

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  Boris Johnson has urged nearly two million people to ""come forward"" and take up the offer of a Covid jab. The prime minister said the UK was closing in on Monday's target for vaccinating nearly 15 million of the most vulnerable people, but some people ""for one reason or another"" have not had one. Speaking at a Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson said the aim was not to ""hit some numerical target, but so we save lives... another step on the long, hard road back to normality"". England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer has said it ""really concerns"" him that fewer people from ethnic minority backgrounds may get the Covid vaccine. Professor Jonathan Van-Tam said that while vaccine uptake has been high among the UK population so far, he's worried it's not going to be ""as rapid or as high"" among ethnic minority communities. ""This virus just doesn't care about what ethnic background you are from,"" he said as he urged everyone to get the jab. Prof Van-Tam was answering audience questions as part of a #BBCYourQuestions session and also addressed concerns about the South African variant and the spread of misinformation.  If you're hoping to get away for a summer break, you might not want to pack your bags just yet. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has warned that people in the UK should not be booking holidays at home or abroad at the moment due to coronavirus. He told the BBC he did not know ""where we'll be in terms of cases, deaths and vaccination"" by the summer. He also said the UK was talking to other countries about setting up an ""international system"" for checking if people have been tested or vaccinated - but this should not be likened to a Covid ""passport"". There's been a lot of focus this week on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine following suggestions it was less effective against the South African variant of Covid-19. Now the World Health Organization has recommended using the vaccine in all adults - whatever their age. Dr Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of the WHO's panel of experts, said there was ""no reason not to recommend its use"" even in countries that have circulation of the coronavirus variant. It comes after several countries have opted not to give the jab to those over 65. The WHO also said spacing out the two doses, as is happening in the UK, makes the vaccine more effective. Many business owners have seen their customer numbers dwindle as a result of the pandemic - including mechanic Jim Walsh. His car repair business was on the brink of collapse due to the fact there are less drivers on the road during lockdown. But the garage is now fully booked this week and busy for the next fortnight after his daughter, Harley, posted a single tweet to drum up business.

WHO backs Oxford vaccine 'even if variants present',"By James GallagherHealth and science correspondent The World Health Organization recommends using the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca even in countries tackling new variants of coronavirus. Some new forms of the virus appear to make vaccines less effective.  The WHO also says the vaccine can be used in people aged over 65, which some countries have advised against. Spacing out the two doses, as is happening in the UK, makes the vaccine more effective, it advises. The Oxford vaccine is seen as the ""vaccine for the world"" as it is cheap, can be mass produced and is stored in a standard fridge. However, it has attracted controversy about its effectiveness against new variants, whether it should be used in the elderly and how far apart the doses should be given, due to a lack of data. The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, known as Sage, has been scrutinising evidence from vaccine trials.  Its interim recommendations say the vaccine is 63% effective overall.  However, early data from trials in South Africa showed the vaccine was offering ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease in young people. The WHO's director of immunisation, Dr Katherine O'Brien, said the South African study was ""inconclusive"" and it was ""plausible"" the vaccine would still prevent severe disease.  A variant in the country has acquired mutations that seem to help it evade immunity from vaccines and from previous infections. However Oxford scientists still expect their vaccine to prevent people from becoming seriously ill with Covid-19 and needing hospital treatment.  ""There is no reason not to recommend its use even in countries that have circulation of the variant,"" said Dr Alejandro Cravioto, the chairman of WHO's Sage.  There has been criticism about a lack of data on the effectiveness of the vaccine in the elderly with some countries, including France and Germany, advising against using it in the over 65s. The WHO said even though there was a small number of over 65s in the trials, other studies showed older people had a nearly identical immune response to younger adults so the vaccine should be used.  The scientific advisers also said giving two doses eight-12 weeks apart increased the vaccine's effectiveness and provided greater protection. Initially, the WHO had recommended a gap of up to six weeks between doses, only in exceptional circumstances. Prof Sarah Gilbert, the chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: ""It is excellent news that the WHO has recommended use of the Sars CoV-2 vaccine first produced in Oxford.  ""This decision paves the way to more widespread use of the vaccine to protect people against Covid-19 and gain control of the pandemic."" Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, said he welcomed the WHO's support for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and for the longer interval between doses. In the UK, more than 13 million people have now received a vaccine to protect against Covid-19. On Wednesday, another 1,001 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test for coronavirus. Globally, there have been more than 2.3 million deaths with the disease during the pandemic Will vaccines always work against Covid?

Travel chief scorns 'puerile' holiday plan warning,"By Robert PlummerBusiness reporter, BBC News Transport Secretary Grant Shapps' call for people to stop making summer holiday plans has been branded ""puerile and nonsensical"" by a senior travel industry professional. ""We're talking about the end of May or June, which is a long way off,"" said Sue Ockwell of the Association of Independent Tour Operators (AITO). Mr Shapps said there was too much uncertainty because of Covid. But Ms Ockwell said booking breaks gave hope to holidaymakers and the industry. ""It's something for people to look forward to and to keep travel companies going,"" she told the BBC. Earlier, Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Please don't go ahead and book holidays. I simply don't know the answer to the question of where we'll be up to this summer. ""It's too early to give that information. The best advice to people is: do nothing at this stage."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson later said it was ""just too early for people to be certain about what we'll be able to do this summer"". He added that he understood ""why people want to make plans now, but we're just going to have to be a little bit more patient"". Mr Shapps' comments have been seen by many in the travel sector as dealing a blow to hopes of a swift recovery for tourism. For Ms Ockwell, they are symptomatic of a government that has failed to listen to her and her colleagues. ""It's highly frustrating. The government doesn't compare notes with anyone in the travel industry,"" she said. ""They could save getting a lot of egg on their faces if they did."" AITO represents about 120 specialist and independent tour operators in the UK.  Ms Ockwell said the industry understood ""the scale of the challenges"" facing the government over coronavirus, but added that tourism brought great benefits to the UK economy and was in need of sector-specific help. ""Holidays bring in a lot of money, holidays employ a lot of people and they're good for us,"" she said. ""We just want to be allowed to trade. That's all we're asking,"" she added. ""We're not forcing people to make bookings. We want people to be allowed to make their own common-sense judgements."" Other travel industry figures have echoed Ms Ockwell's dismay. Brian Strutton, general secretary of pilots' union Balpa, said: ""Airlines are drowning but, rather than throwing us a life raft, the transport secretary has just thrown a bucket of cold water at us."" And trade organisation Abta said waiting until the UK's vaccination programme was completed before allowing people to travel abroad meant ""we'll lose another summer season to the pandemic"". Several big travel companies, including Tui and Ryanair, have said they expect to see a strong rebound in bookings this summer. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary told the BBC he remained ""optimistic"" that British people would be allowed to travel from May onwards. ""Many companies will not see their way through next winter if we go through a second summer of no bookings,"" he added.

Strike ballot to be opened over DVLA Covid cases,"Staff at the DVLA headquarters, which has seen more than 500 Covid cases since September, are to be balloted for strike action. The PCS union said the DVLA had been ""forcing"" staff to go into the Swansea office despite the infections.  It comes after MP Geraint Davies called for the UK government to reduce the number of workers at the centre.  Boris Johnson said at Prime Minister's Questions all staff who can work from home, were working from home.  The DVLA rejected claims it is ""an unsafe place to work"". The ballot will be open from 18 February until 11 March, the union said.  Both Mr Davies and the PCS Union said 250 people were working on the site last March, but that number is now in the thousands.  It was announced last month that one member of staff had died with coronavirus.  PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ""It is a scandal that DVLA have insisted over 2,000 staff members come into work every day, despite having the biggest outbreak of Covid in an office workplace within the UK."" He added management had shown a ""cruel indifference"" to staff's concerns.  The coronavirus outbreak was declared at the offices in the Llansamlet area of Swansea in December after 352 cases in the space of four months. The total number of Covid cases at the site now stands at 526, according to Mr Davies.  Speaking at Prime Minister's questions, Labour MP for Swansea West, Mr Davies, said thousands were now working at the site ""facing a more infectious and widespread disease"". ""Yesterday 90 people were sent home following the latest outbreak of coronavirus just before the weekend,"" he told the Commons.

The DVLA later said only 37 staff had been sent home on Tuesday after one staff member had tested positive.  It added this had not been declared an outbreak by Public Health Wales.  The prime minister responded that ""to the best of my knowledge"" out of the workforce of 6,000 there were ""thankfully"" only nine cases of Covid now and three of those individuals were currently working from home.  Mr Johnson said that the DVLA was pursuing a working from home strategy. He added the UK government was ""rolling out lateral flow tests"" but said the ""long term solution"" was vaccinating people.  A DVLA spokesperson said: ""We care deeply about the safety of DVLA staff and we fully reject the claims made that DVLA is an unsafe place to work. Rigorous protocols are in place to ensure a Covid-secure workplace.

Lockdown murder accused: 'It was like I dreamt it',"A man who choked his wife to death days into the first national lockdown has told a court ""it was like I dreamt it"". Anthony Williams, 70, strangled his wife Ruth Williams after a row at their home in Cwmbran, Torfaen, on 28 March. At the time Mr Williams, who denies murder butÂ admits manslaughter by diminished responsibility, says he had money worries and could not sleep. During his police interview,Mr Williams had said ""I feel bewildered"", Swansea Crown Court heard.   Talking to officers the day after his 67-year-old wife's death, Mr Williams also told officers ""in my mind it feels like it never happened"", according to a transcript read to the court. He was asked by one of the interviewing detectives why has someone ""who has gone 69 years without breaking the law done this?"", the court heard ""I just flipped because I hadn't slept. I started screaming and strangling her,"" said Mr Williams.  ""I don't know why, my wife was trying to make me stop. But I didn't. I then thought what have I done and I regretted it, so I went next door for help and called an ambulance."" The officers also askedÂ how he had been feeling since the national lockdown came into force.  Mr Williams told them he found the restrictions ""really, really difficult"". He said ""I worry about money because I've got nothing set up. I always go to the bank and get money out from the teller. I kept on thinking we'd run out of money. Then I started worrying about every little thing."" Asked by the officers whether he had discussed his concerns with his wife of 46 years, he said he had not. The court heard Mr Williams had been retired for a year after working in a factory in Cwmbran for 38 years.Â  He told the officers:Â ""I don't think I've coped well since retirement. I didn't have as much of a pension as I'd thought. But I was naÃ¯ve I hadn't given it a thought while I was working.  ""But I've been worrying about it for months. I just worry all the time now. I've always been a belt and braces man but now I'm always worrying."" The court heard Mrs Williams was also retired after working at Asda in Cwmbran, but her husband said she had been ""loving retirement"". The court heard how Mr Willams would feel depressed after not sleeping properly and how his wife would tell him to ""pull yourself together"". But the defendant said he did not argue with his wife and at most they had had ""niggles"".  When asked what these were, he said ""The niggles would mainly be about me being lazy and her wanting me to do something in the house or garden."" He was asked in the police interview if he had had any thoughts about harming his wife, but he said he had not and there had never been any violence in their relationship.Â  The trial continues.

University boss faces no confidence vote,"The vice chancellor of the University of Manchester is facing a vote of no confidence by its students. The Student Union said the referendum about Dame Nancy Rothwell would be held next month after a petition met the threshold to trigger a vote. Relations deteriorated when students complained about the erection of a fence around a hall of residence. A university spokesman said it had worked hard to provide students with the best possible learning experience.  The referendum is the first vote over a vice chancellor in the university's history and asks whether students agree with the following statement: ""This student body has no confidence in Vice Chancellor Dame Nancy Rothwell and other university leaders."" A student campaign group, which is calling for her to be removed from the post, claims: ""In September, the university brought students back to campus on the basis that face-to-face teaching would go ahead, only to cancel it weeks later.  ""This led to a significant outbreak of Covid-19 amongst students, with thousands infected and countless lives put at risk, including those working in administrative and cleaning roles on campus."" The motion also points to a series of incidents which underlined the tensions between the students and university authorities. Students ""occupied"" a University of Manchester building in November to protest, demanding rents be reduced by 40%. It followed an earlier protest when students living at the university's Fallowfield halls of residence tore down ""prison-like"" fencing erected around their campus on the first day of England's autumn lockdown. In the same month the university suspended three security guards who were accused of ""racially profiling"" a student. A university spokesman: ""The pandemic has caused a great deal of disruption for students, and they have not been able to have the university experience they would have expected.  ""We have not got everything right, but we are committed to working closely with student representatives to address concerns and meet student needs.""

Group fined for 240-mile trip to see Whitby Abbey,"A group of 11 people who travelled from Manchester to Whitby to see the town's abbey have been fined for breaking coronavirus rules. North Yorkshire Police said those on the 240-mile (386km) round trip were among 169 people they fined for lockdown breaches in the past week. Other incidents included pubs which opened for people to ""watch rugby or play pool"". Supt Mike Walker said 71 fines were for illegal indoor gatherings. North Yorkshire's Local Resilience Forum heard the majority of fines were handed out in Scarborough, with 76 issued, while 37 were issued in York and 21 in Craven, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Speaking at the meeting, Mr Walker said the snow had not stopped people breaching lockdown rules. ""Sadly, the weather did not seem to put anyone off,"" he said. ""We're still dealing with people travelling long distances, making irresponsible visits and journeys in North Yorkshire. ""Also house parties continue to be an issue that officers have to deal with. ""I can't stress enough the risk these people are taking."" Mr Walker warned that with half-term approaching people must ""not travel to the coast"" and said patrols were being increased to catch people flouting the rules.

Capt Sir Tom's family 'overwhelmed by support',"Captain Sir Tom Moore's family have been ""overwhelmed"" by public support since his death, his daughter has said. The 100-year-old died at Bedford Hospital on 2 February, two days after being admitted with breathing problems. In a statement on Twitter, Hannah Ingram-Moore said: ""Captain Sir Tom was simply father, Tom and grandad to us. He was our world."" Capt Sir Tom came to prominence as he raised Â£33m for NHS charities ahead of his 100th birthday. Ms Ingram-Moore said: ""We lived at home as an inter-generational family for over 13 years and although, like many, we weren't perfect, we were perfectly happy. ""He was strong, kind, and full of humour and was the best mentor and confidant you could ever wish for.  ""There is little pain that compares to losing someone you love and each one of us is feeling my father's absence. Nothing can prepare you for that sudden wrench when their time comes to leave."" She said: ""It's the little noises and habits of people close to you that suddenly become deafening in their absence.""  Ms Ingram-Moore added the support had been ""overwhelming"" and gave her hope her father's ""message of hope will live on"". She said: ""He held a place in so many people's hearts and because of that we understand that we aren't grieving alone. We want you to know we are with you.""

South Africa may swap or sell AstraZeneca vaccine,"South Africa is considering swapping or selling the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine against coronavirus, the health minister says. The country has one and half million doses of the AstraZeneca jab. But plans to use it to vaccinate health workers have been put on hold after a small study suggested a ""minimal"" effect against the country's new variant in young people. It now intends to use a vaccine from Johnson & Johnson instead. ""There are already some countries that are asking that we must sell it to them,"" South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize told a news conference on Wednesday. ""Our scientists will continue with further deliberations on the AstraZeneca vaccine used in South Africa and depending on their advice, the vaccine will be swapped before the expiry date."" He added that he was due to speak with the World Health Organization (WHO) shortly after the news conference.  The WHO's vaccine experts came out later on Wednesday to say that even countries with the South African variant of coronavirus should use the AstraZeneca vaccine.  Mr Mkhize is yet to comment since WHO's announcement. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million cases of coronavirus, and 47,000 deaths - far more than anywhere else on the continent. Researchers from the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University carried out the trial on around 2,000 healthy, young people with an average age of 31. It has not yet been published or peer reviewed but a press release and a PowerPoint presentation were put together. They found that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases of the South Africa variant of coronavirus in that low-risk group. This means that even in people who've been vaccinated, the virus could still spread from person to person. But it did not look at the impact of the vaccine on severe disease from Covid because there was no-one in the study who was in a high-risk category (over 50) or had an underlying health condition. Oxford University researchers say promising results from other trials using similar vaccines in South Africa suggest their shot should be effective at preventing severe cases - the main aim of all Covid vaccines. South Africa now plans to give the AstraZeneca jab to a group of 100,000 older nurses and healthcare workers. That's to see if the vaccine is effective against the new variant and in preventing severe illness in an older age group. The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected.  As with the original strain, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. At least 20 other countries, including Austria, Japan, Kenya, Norway and the UK, have found cases of the variant. The health minister for neighbouring Eswatini, previously known as Swaziland, said on Tuesday that it would no longer use the AstraZeneca vaccine.  The health authorities in Malawi have said they still plan to use the AstraZeneca vaccine. Negotiations are still going on over the amount and the price South Africa will pay for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen. It has not yet been approved for use in South Africa.  The first of the nine million doses it has ordered are due to arrive next week. Mr Mkhize said these would be provided to some 500,000 healthworkers  as ""an implementation study"", possibly starting as early as next week, but this was still to be confirmed. He also promised to explain next week just how much of the vaccine will be coming to South Africa. Mr Mkhize said that South Africa had already secured vaccine doses from Pfizer which it has agreed to bring in earlier than originally agreed.  The country is also in discussions with other manufactures, including the makers of Sputnik V, Sinovac and Moderna vaccines, he added.

Businesses operating with one person to reopen,"Businesses which can operate with one person and are unable to work from home can reopen from Thursday, the States of Guernsey has announced. These businesses, including the self-employed and sole traders, can reopen if their staff member will not come into contact with anyone. Some households, such as single parents, lone carers and those living alone, can also form support bubbles. Masks will become mandatory in all indoor public places from Saturday. The slate of announcements from the States of Guernsey comes ahead of a three stage exit from lockdown, which will begin on 18 February at the earliest, the Civil Contingencies Authority (CCA) said. The bailiwick has seen 450 coronavirus infections since the outbreak on 22 January, which prompted an island-wide lockdown. Active cases are currently at 336, with 19 new infections identified on Monday and Tuesday. The changes to non-essential business rules mean lone workers may return to offices, workshops or other premises, as long as they can do so without any contact with other individuals, including colleagues, customers or clients. The States cited the example of non-essential retailers being able to fulfil online orders as a result of the change.  For those who operate outdoors, lone workers may return to property and building maintenance, gardening and horticulture, and fishing or other maritime work with similar contact restrictions. CCA Chairman Peter Ferbrache said: ""These immediate changes to lockdown are about getting people back to work whose activity poses little or no risk to further the transmission of the virus.""

Airport to get £18.5m emergency loan,"Birmingham Airport is to get an Â£18.5m emergency loan from the city council to help avoid the threat of insolvency. Since the pandemic, the airport has seen passenger numbers fall by 91%. The loan was approved by the cabinet group on Tuesday when councillors were told the site was enduring the most ""severe downturn"" in its history. However, some councillors questioned whether more funding might be needed in future due to on-going uncertainty about air travel. Birmingham City Council is one of seven local authorities in the region that are shareholders of the airport's holding company BAHL. All of them were approached for financial assistance and the meeting heard four will contribute to the loan along with the other shareholder, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, LDRS reported. Councillor Meirion Jenkins asked if Â£18.5m was sufficient, while suggesting councils perhaps had ""no choice"" but to approve the loan to stop the airport going insolvent and more money being lost. In response, council leader Ian Ward said the airport had taken a conservative approach to the return of passengers and he was ""reasonably confident this is a number that we will not have to revisit"", although the situation was still uncertain. ""The risk here if we don't put this loan in and ensure the liquidity of the airport is that we would lose control of the airport as seven metropolitan authorities,"" he said. ""I think it is in the interests of all of the West Midlands authorities and the people across the West Midlands that we do continue to exercise influence over the airport."" The airport said it had taken measures to preserve cash and manage costs, including suspending capital projects and using the government's Job Retention Scheme. ""Any support is very much welcomed as the airport deals with the ongoing impact of Covid-19 and rebuilds post-pandemic to support the region's economic recovery and air transportation needs,"" a spokesperson said.

10-year jail term for Covid travel lies defended,"A maximum 10-year jail term for lying about recent travel history has been defended by the government. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the British public ""would expect pretty strong action"" and the maximum sentence reflects the seriousness of the crime. It was criticised by former Supreme Court judge Lord Sumption who said lower tariffs exist for sex offences. From Monday, people arriving in England from ""red list"" countries must isolate for 10 days in hotels, costing Â£1,750. It follows concerns that existing vaccines being rolled out in the UK may struggle to control new virus variants identified around the world. Meanwhile, Mr Shapps said people should not be booking holidays either in the UK or abroad, and that it was ""too soon"" for sun-seekers to plan getaways. ""People shouldn't be booking holidays right now - not domestically or internationally,"" he told the Today programme, prompting the travel industry to warn of another lost summer. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the public would need to ""get used to the idea of vaccinating and then re-vaccinating in the autumn"" due to new variants. And, speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said the hotel quarantine plan was ""measured"" and ""proportionate"". Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Lord Sumption accused Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who announced the latest measures - of losing his connection with reality. ""Ten years is the maximum sentence for threats to kill, non-fatal poisoning or indecent assault,"" he wrote.  ""Does Mr Hancock really think that non-disclosure of a visit to Portugal is worse than the large number of violent firearms offences or sexual offences involving minors, for which the maximum is seven years?"" Former Tory MP and ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve said the 10-year penalty was ""a mistake"", ""exaggerated"" and ""entirely disproportionate"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is that nobody would get such a sentence anyway, the courts are simply not going to impose it.  ""Now I recognise that the government has to put down strict rules and needs to have penalties to enforce them. ""But to suggest that a 10-year sentence is going to result from a false declaration on a form on landing at Heathrow Airport is, I think, a mistake because it is exaggerated, it is not going to happen."" Failing to quarantine in a designated hotel after arriving from a ""red list"" country will carry a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. The 10-year jail term would be the maximum penalty for anyone found to have falsified their travel history on the mandatory passenger locator form filled in by travellers when they arrive in the UK. New border measures also require international arrivals to pay for additional tests during their quarantine period. Downing Street said MPs will not be asked to vote on the plans as the government will be including the restrictions under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981. Asked about harsh penalties attached to the new measures, Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast those who are fined as much as Â£10,000 would have to ""go out of their way to lie and cheat"" the new system. Mr Shapps said the 10-year maximum jail term reflected the ""serious"" nature of the offence. ""I think the British public would expect pretty strong action"" for those who seek to evade hotel quarantine, he said. Around 1,300 people a week are arriving into the UK from the 33 red list countries - including Portugal, Brazil and South Africa - at the moment, Mr Shapps said. International travel is currently banned, other than for a small number of permitted reasons, including for essential work, medical appointments and education. Holidays are not allowed. Mr Shapps confirmed ministers were speaking to other governments about a potential ""international system"" to check whether travellers have been vaccinated - or tested for - coronavirus. Downing Street said Mr Johnson will outline a ""roadmap"" for easing the current national restrictions in the week of 22 February. England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told a BBC News Your Questions special it was ""certainly plausible"" other countries may insist visitors are vaccinated. But he stressed mandatory vaccination has never been a policy in the UK before and described confidence in jabs among the public as ""super high"". Airlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said. The penalties also include a Â£1,000 fine for travellers who fail to take the new mandatory tests and a Â£2,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine. Asked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: ""We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe."" The Scottish government said it would go further than England's measures and require everyone arriving by air to isolate in hotels for 10 days. The Institute for Government think tank said different hotel quarantine rules across the UK add ""another layer of complexity"" as it warned of ""big gaps"" in the policy. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer criticised the delay in introducing hotel quarantine and said research showed the UK was lagging behind other nations when it came to border security. All travellers arriving in the UK are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test and must self-isolate for 10 days. This negative test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. They must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate.  A ""test to release scheme"" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - remains under the new testing rules. Passengers will be expected to use the gold-standard, and more expensive, PCR tests. People leaving England will soon have to declare their reasons for travel prior to departure.

£500k Manx community event support scheme extended,"A Â£500,000 government fund to encourage more community events on the Isle of Man has been extended for six months. Under the initiative, community groups can claim up to 80% of the cost of staging events including markets, festivals and concerts. Applications under the Domestic Events Fund will now close on 30 September. Enterprise Minister Laurence Skelly said local events were playing a ""key part"" in repairing the Manx economy following the coronavirus pandemic. The cancellation of many major events, including the TT races for two consecutive years, has hit many businesses that rely on tourist income and led to a drop in footfall in town centres. Community events helped to ""increase spending in nearby retail and hospitality businesses"", Mr Skelly said. ""With many large island events cancelled and ongoing travel restrictions affecting the 2021 peak season, it is vital that we continue to support our domestic businesses as much as we can,"" he added. The fund has so far supported 10 initiatives, including events in Douglas, Onchan and Peel, increasing visitor numbers. Mobile caterers Mike and Josie Wade, who organised a series of pop-up music and artisan food events in December, said the funding had given them the ""confidence to be able to think outside of the box and host a new event"".

EU Commission chief admits vaccine failures,"The EU was late to authorise Covid-19 vaccines and ""still not where we want to be"", European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said. She also acknowledged the EU had been overconfident about production targets being met amid delays at factories. The Commission chief has come under fire for the EU's slow vaccine rollout. There is anger that the bloc has fallen behind countries like the UK, where more than 12 million people have already received the jab. But Mrs von der Leyen was adamant that ordering vaccines collectively on behalf of member states was ""the right thing to do"". Meanwhile pharmaceutical group AstraZeneca has said it will join forces with German company IDT Biologika to produce more vaccines for Europe. Producers of vaccines including the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech jabs have postponed delivery of some of the EU's order because of capacity and supply issues.  This was Mrs von der Leyen's first public acceptance of criticism. Last week, she told German paper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung that ""a country on its own can be a speedboat, the EU is more like a tanker"". ""We were late to authorise. We were too optimistic when it came to massive production,"" the Commission president told the European Parliament, ""and perhaps too confident that what we ordered would actually be delivered on time."" She also noted that questions would have to be answered about what went wrong.  However, Mrs von der Leyen maintained that a joint EU response had been the correct decision in dealing with the pandemic: ""I can't even imagine if a few big players had rushed to it and the others went empty-handed. ""In economic terms it would have been nonsense and it would have been I think the end of our community."" She also defended the time taken to approve vaccines, which she described as ""an essential investment to establish confidence and security"". The Commission president said she ""deeply"" regretted a threat made by the EU last month to restrict the flow of vaccines passing between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. ""But in the end we got it right and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace in Northern Ireland.""  By Kevin Connolly, Europe correspondent, Brussels The EU's vaccination programme has become an important political test for the European Commission, which took over responsibility for the rollout from individual member states. It has also become a critical test of the personal standing of Ursula von der Leyen. She has now acknowledged failings and admitting underestimating the difficulties of mass production. But this was not by any means a straightforward apology. Mrs von der Leyen said it was right for the EU to have acted together, not in competition.  The experiences of Serbia, which is not an EU member state, and Hungary, which is, point to a possible solution to vaccine shortages in Europe. Both have turned to suppliers of Russian and Chinese vaccines to supplement supplies from Western pharmaceutical companies. Right-wing Danish MEP Peter Kofod complained that the EU was ""treading water"" while other countries such as the UK, US and Israel made big strides in vaccinating their populations. Addressing Mrs von der Leyen directly, left-wing French MEP Manon Aubry asked: ""How could the European Commission accept to just lie down when dealing with the pharma companies?""  But there was support for the EU's response, too. Spanish centre-right Euro MP Esteban GonzÃ¡lez Pons said if it had not been for the Commission's decision to centralise the purchase of vaccines, his country and others would not have received their consignments ""because of a lack of political clout and budget"". ""Not everything was perfect in the last weeks and the last months,"" said Manfred Weber, the chairman of the centre-right EPP group of MEPs. ""The key decisions were right.""

NI health service to get £175m for more PPE,"By Clodagh RiceBBC News NI Business Correspondent The NI Executive has agreed how to allocate Â£226.5m in funding, including Â£190m which is going to the Department of Health. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the allocations included Â£175m to purchase additional personal protective equipment (PPE).  He said this will ""ensure the continued protection of front-line health workers leading the fight against Covid-19"". After Wednesday's allocations, there is still about Â£250m yet to be allocated. More than Â£15.2m of capital allocations will fund the purchase of medical equipment across cardiology, urology and radiology specialisms, and help procure licenses for digital health technology. Aside from health, Â£27m is being allocated to support students as per an announcement last week. Some Â£9m is being allocated to the Forest Service and Â£42,000 of capital funding is being allocated to the Commission for Victims and Survivors. ""I continue to discuss funding flexibility with Treasury and expect to carry forward any further funding provided into 2021-22,"" said the minister.  ""However, Treasury have advised this will not include flexibility in relation to the funding received before Christmas.  ""It is therefore important this Â£200m is now made available for reallocation,"" he added.  Mr Murphy reinforced his calls to his executive colleagues to come forward with bids to use the Â£250m that has not yet been allocated. He said: ""I continue to urge executive ministers to bring forwards proposals to use available funding, particularly for those who to date haven't received support."" Health Minister Robin Swann has welcomed the reallocation, which was made possible after the Treasury waived budgeting rules for Covid PPE stock this year. Mr Swann said: ""The changes made by the Treasury will allow my department to spend Â£175m in this financial year on PPE supplies that can be used in the 2021/22 financial year."" Consumables such as PPE are normally counted as expenditure as they are used. The concession in relation to Covid PPE will allow stocks of PPE to build and to overlap financial years. The minister continued: ""The move by Treasury will allow my Department to spend the money in the 2020/21 financial year to boost supplies for later use.""   He said it would be ""significant"" in dealing with the cost consequences of the pandemic.

'Encouraging signs' Welsh Covid cases falling,"There are ""encouraging signs"" coronavirus cases in Wales are falling, the head of NHS Wales has said. Chief Executive Andrew Goodall said rates of the virus in the community were ""significantly down"" from where they were in December. Over a similar period the number of hospital patients with Covid has fallen by about a quarter. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show a second week of falling death rates in Wales. Meanwhile, the latest Public Health Wales (PHW) figures showed the number of cases per 100,000 people in Wales had fallen to 111.4.  Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Dr Goodall said: ""Our community prevalence rates are down, they are down very significantly from where we were in December. ""We see the positivity rates and the reproduction values are well down within Wales now. ""Just over the last two or three weeks or so the number of patients in hospitals for coronavirus has actually reduced by about a quarter."" However, he cautioned there were still more than 2,000 patients in hospital with the virus. ""That is going to still take us some time I think to reduce those to what we would say would be close to normal levels,"" he said. At the Welsh Government press briefing, Dr Goodall added the Welsh NHS was still in a ""precarious"" position, with the number of people in critical care - with other conditions as well as Covid - running over capacity.  ""There are still nearly 50% more patients with coronavirus in hospital beds than at the peak of the first wave in April."" He added 202 people were in field hospital beds.  Dr Giri Shankar, from PHW, also sounded a note of caution, particularly for north Wales. He said: ""Although the data currently shows all-Wales numbers of cases are reducing and that the incidence is now below 120 cases per 100,000 population, the rates in some areas - particularly in north Wales - are still at nearly double that, and there have been small increases in others. ""It is encouraging to see that the numbers of people being treated for coronavirus in our hospitals is reducing, [but] there are still a large number of people who are extremely ill, which means that the pressure on services is still very high."" But Dr Goodall also warned the rate of critical care deaths in hospital could be 25% more in the second wave due to the number of patients being admitted with Covid. ""I think what is different in the second wave, that it has just been a higher volume and that is the thing that has caused the pressure right across our system. ""And it will mean sadly in areas like critical care, although the data will say that some of the outcomes feel the same [as the first wave], we would have ended up sadly with 25% more deaths in a critical care environment,"" said Dr Goodall. ""We would expect a normal emergency medical patient to stay for perhaps between five to seven days, a typical coronavirus patient coming in to our hospitals will be there for three times longer than that."" ""There will be ongoing problems with patients who need to be cared for after they've been discharged, but also those that will still need to receive care in the community."" Asked about the long-effect on waiting lists, Dr Goodall said: ""We've had to prioritise the immediate problems facing us to ensure that the NHS has the resilience to be able to respond. ""It will take us some time, maybe even some years, to work our way through some of the pressures that we've had. However he said the pandemic was a chance to ""reset"" the way patients in hospitals and community settings received cared as there had been so much ""transformation"" in delivery during the pandemic.

Families make plea to resume care home visiting,"Relatives of care home residents are telling the Scottish government it is time to let them visit their loved ones. After almost 11 months, many are still only seeing vulnerable relatives through windows or outside, if at all. The Scottish government says new guidelines on visiting are ""imminent"". But MSPs are due to consider a petition on Wednesday calling for one designated visitor per care home resident to be allowed. National Records of Scotland statistics show that since restrictions were first introduced in March 2020, 14,273 residents have died inside Scottish care homes.  Covid has been a factor in one in five of the deaths but relatives fear many more have been caused by the isolation their loved ones have felt over the past year with many simply just giving up. With almost all care home residents having had their first vaccine dose, families are hoping for good news on visiting. Elaine Macdonald is one of them. She has seen deterioration in her mum Jean McKay since the start of the pandemic. Jean, 81, has advanced Alzheimers and has lived in a care home for five years. Until March 2020, Elaine and her sister took her out twice a week. Since restrictions were placed on visits, they have only been able to see their mum through a window, and for a short time in the summer they had outdoor visits.  Elaine believes that after almost a year, something better should be possible. ""Other groups in society, outside the care home setting, are able to form extended households and bubbles,"" she said. ""And here we are in care homes and it is like prison - people are not allowed to see their relatives in a normal way, there is no holding hands and no contact.  ""It makes me feel frustrated and sad and I am beginning to wonder if we are ever going to get in to see them properly again."" She added: ""Nobody puts their relative in a care home expecting never to be able to see them again. Nobody would do it, and now I know people who are deciding not to do it."" ""It's time to let people have their relationships with their family members again - this whole situation is inhumane and it has to come to an end."" Natasha Hamilton, from Edinburgh, is desperate to see more of her mum Anne, who has early onset dementia and is in a home in East Kilbride. She started a petition in September to give residents like Anne the right to see at least one caregiving relative, regardless of lockdown or levels. ""We are doing it for her,"" she said. ""She would fight to see her children, she would fight to see her husband. We are fighting so mum has the right to see her family.  ""I find it absolutely awful thinking what is going through her head just now - that those faces she used to know, visiting her all the time, are no longer there. That part hurts me more than me not being able to see my mum.  ""We have to learn from this so that care home residents are not kept apart from their families for almost a year again. Residents in care homes have to be living, not just existing."" The petition has more than 92,000 signatures and is to be considered by a committee of MSPs on Wednesday. During FMQs, Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie pressed the first minister for a date on when safe visiting of care homes may be allowed. Nicola Sturgeon said that new guidance on the matter was being worked on and would be ""published imminently"", but would not commit to a date. ""I very much hope we can reach that position soon but just as I have tried to avoid doing in past, I have tried to refrain from giving simplistic or easy answers. ""I think that would be wrong and run the risk of giving families falsehoods. I want a date we can have some confidence in. I don't underestimate how deeply traumatic this is."" Hundreds of relatives have also been sending letters and posters to their MSPs in the ""Broken Hearts"" campaign to draw attention to the issue. National clinical director Jason Leitch said during Tuesday's coronavirus briefing that Health Secretary Jeane Freeman was finalising new advice. He said: ""New guidance is imminent that will be published shortly, once the cabinet secretary has final meetings with officials.  ""She has met with the care home relatives group, as have I. It's not just about vaccine, it's protection from outbreaks, it's test and protect, it's staff, it's PPE and it is about what should and could be permitted for families to reconnect after such a long time."" Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Scottish Care, which represents the private care sector in Scotland, said everyone involved had been consulted over the new plans. He added that after 11 months there was a realisation that the risk of the virus and the risk of people no longer being in touch and in contact with their families had to be balanced. He said: ""One of the reasons we are all trying to engage is so we don't get a lottery of one company doing it and another not doing it. The reason people are anxious is because of the fear of the  virus.  ""No care provider wants to keep people apart. Neither do they want the devastation of this virus.  ""What we are doing is to reduce the fear, increase confidence and make sure visiting can happen indoors as a matter of priority.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55990256,1
Covid response officials 'are struggling to cope',"By Jayne McCormackBBC News NI Political Reporter Some Stormont officials are struggling to cope due to ""significant"" pressure to deliver Covid-19 support schemes, a top civil servant has warned. Mike Brennan, from the Department for the Economy, said staff vacancies are currently at about 25%. He said that had led to officials being overworked while trying to get support packages up and running. One senior official had to be admitted to hospital on Tuesday night because of pressures, he added. ""That's not unique - I can give you other incidences where staff are under pressure to deliver because the public and political expectation is there,"" Mr Brennan said. ""There needs to be a recognition that these guys are doing their best as quickly and professionally as possible, and the vacancy rate is not helping."" On Wednesday, Mr Brennan told Stormont's Economy Committee that across the Northern Ireland Civil Service there are about 4,500 vacancies within the workforce at present. He put some of the delays in recruitment down to competition processes being postponed due to the pandemic. Mr Brennan, who is the department's permanent secretary, also addressed accusations that the department has been slow to develop financial support schemes. ""They are having to deliver, at pace, grant schemes they didn't have any expertise in doing,"" he said. ""I think what has been achieved, in terms of getting out that level of spend, is a marvellous achievement. ""There was always a recognition that there would be some degree of error but the minute an error is identified officials get hammered."" He told the committee that the department faced difficulty in the next financial year to deliver routine services while managing economic effects of the pandemic and Brexit.

'No intention' to publish financial support list,"The names of Guernsey businesses receiving coronavirus financial support during lockdown will not be published. The Policy and Resources Committee (P&R) said it had ""no intention"" of releasing a list which identifies businesses offered payroll help. However, the committee said it does plan to publish anonymous summaries of how public money is being spent. Some business owners had expressed outrage over being possibly identified for getting support. The States of Guernsey's payroll co-funding scheme pays 80% of the island's Â£8.70 minimum wage to employees, with businesses required to provide the remainder. P&R has sought to reassure the public after some business owners expressed ""concern and confusion"" over being possibly identified as receiving support. The Treasury lead for the committee, Deputy Mark Helyar, said it was regrettable there had been ""confusion"" among the public, arguing their plans had been ""extensively misreported particularly in social media"". He explained they had ""no intention of publishing details of individual claims"" and the committee had never stated publically this was the plan for disclosing information about how taxpayer money was being spent during the pandemic. Mr Helyar said: ""Tens of millions of pounds of public money are currently being paid out in business support. ""It is vitally important that these funds go to claimants who need them and that the public, in due course, understand where the money has gone."" The clarification comes after a recent U-turn over a new clause which would have allowed the States to reclaim support from businesses who were profitable at the end of the year. Initial plans were amended to allow the self-employed and sole traders to claim Â£50,000 of ""personal expenses"" before any attempts were made to recoup money, The clause was subsequently suspended entirely until March after businesses expressed fears of ""large scale redundancies"" should it go ahead.

Mr Woods also said the force had a busy weekend across the county dealing with 461 incidents and issuing 227 on-the-spot fines. He said the main problems were with house parties and unnecessary journeys. ""We are really starting to clamp down,"" Mr Woods added. ""This is our line in the sand - enough is enough.

Bat scientists find new coronavirus evidence,"By Helen BriggsBBC Environment correspondent Scientists say coronaviruses related to Sars-CoV-2 may be circulating in bats across many parts of Asia. They have discovered a virus that is a close match to the virus that causes Covid-19 in bats at a wildlife sanctuary in eastern Thailand. And they predict that similar coronaviruses may be present in bats across many Asian nations and regions.  The discovery extends the area in which related viruses have been found to a distance of 4,800km (2,983 miles). And it gives clues to how Covid-19 might have emerged. The researchers said sampling was limited, but they were confident that coronaviruses ""with a high degree of genetic relatedness to Sars-CoV-2 are widely present in bats across many nations and regions in Asia"". The area includes Japan, China and Thailand, the researchers said in a report published in Nature Communications. Past studies have suggested that Sars-CoV-2 emerged in an animal, most likely a bat, before spreading to humans. The precise origins of the virus are unknown and have been investigated by a team commissioned by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the latest research, a team lead by Lin-Fa Wang of Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore detected a close relative of Sars-CoV-2 in horseshoe bats kept in an artificial cave at a wildlife sanctuary in Thailand. The virus, named RacCS203, is a close match to the genetic code of Sars-CoV-2 (with 91.5% similarity in their genomes).  It is also closely related to another coronavirus - called RmYN02 - which is found in bats in Yunnan, China (with 93.6% similarity to the genome of Sars-CoV-2). ""We need to do more surveillance in animals,"" said Prof Wang. ""In order to find the true origin, the surveillance work needs to go beyond the border of China."" One big concern is the ability of coronaviruses to move between different mammals, for example cats, dogs and minks. By moving between species, the virus can mutate and evolve into a new pathogen, which could explain how Covid-19 emerged. Dr Thiravat Hemachudha of Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, Thailand, was part of the team of international researchers. The viruses found in bats in Thailand and China act as ""a perfect template that can recombine with others and eventually evolve as new emerging pathogen(s), Covid-19 virus as one"", he said. The researchers also examined antibodies in bats and a trafficked pangolin seized in southern Thailand. The antibodies were able to neutralise the pandemic virus, which is further evidence that Sars-CoV-2-related coronaviruses are circulating in Southeast Asia, they said.  Commenting, Prof Martin Hibberd of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the findings highlighted the broad distribution of bats and viruses that may include the originator of the current outbreak.   ""Further work is required to understand how Sars-CoV-2 passed from animals to humans, with the recent WHO investigators in Wuhan showing that as of yet, these is no conclusive evidence of how this happened,"" he said.

I saved dad's business with a single tweet,"A woman has described how she brought her father's car repair business back from the brink of collapse by posting a single tweet. Harley Walsh says she posted an image of her mechanic dad, Jim, in the hope of drumming up a few customers. Her appeal was prompted after Jim said his East Kilbride business of 35 years was ""in crisis"" because of the pandemic. He has remained open during lockdown as an essential business, but has seen his customers dwindle to almost nothing. Harley said customer numbers had dropped from five per day to fewer than five per week in recent months because Covid travel restrictions had curbed the number of drivers on the road. On Thursday, the eyelash technician tweeted the photo of her dad in order to drum up what she hoped would be a modest number of bookings. But within an hour the post had been shared over 1,000 times, snowballing to over 19,000 shares in less than a week. She said the garage was now fully booked this week and was busy for the next fortnight. The tweet read: ""This is my Dad. His car mechanic garage of 35+ years is in crisis due to the ongoing pandemic.  ""If it keeps going this way, it isn't likely it will survive."" ""It's been dire for dad recently"", Harley told BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. ""He's never had any issues, but on Thursday he had no one in - it's been like that for a few months now. ""I actually had to persuade my mum and dad to let me put [the tweet] up because he just felt a bit like, 'uch I'm just asking people to come in'. ""I said 'but dad you're asking for honest work'. It kind of blew up, he was so overwhelmed."" Harley said the dip in business was beginning to take its toll on Jim - but he was now back to his old self. And the majority of new business as a result of the tweet is young customers who they expect will return. ""We're just hoping that it can continue,"" said Harley. ""Dad seems to think that young folk don't need their cars fixed so he was really surprised at how many young people were reaching out to him for MOTs, services and brakes.  ""It just shows that there's good people and it's nice to see that on social media ""Last week he just kept coming over and giving me a hug, just randomly during the day when I was helping him at work.

Scots quarantine plan to cover all overseas flights,"Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. The Scottish government said it would be ""block booking"" 1,300 rooms at six hotels near the country's airports. The Â£1,750 cost of the stay will have to be borne by passengers themselves. A similar scheme will operate in other parts of the UK, but unlike Scotland, only flights from countries on a ""red list"" will be covered.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said on Tuesday there were approximately 1,600 Scottish arrivals in the last week of January, and numbers fell to 730 in the first week of February.  He said: ""The number of travellers coming to Scotland directly is reducing and I expect these restrictions to reduce arrivals yet further.  ""These measures will be backed with criminal offences as usual. The stronger approach we are taking are necessary and appropriate."" Mr Matheson confirmed that an online booking system, run by the UK government, would go live on Thursday. People travelling to Scotland will then be required to use the portal to book and pay for a quarantine hotel room if they are arriving from Monday. The Â£1,750 charge for the room includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs.  A welfare fund will be developed for people struggling to meet these charges, Mr Matheson added. He said anyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct.  A spokesman for AGS Airports, which owns Aberdeen International and Glasgow Airports, said: ""Bar two oil and gas related flights at Aberdeen, there are no other international flights at our airports, so these latest measures will have no impact as the damage had already been done.  ""We've stated previously that we understand the need for emergency measures, however, we urgently need to work with government on developing a recovery plan for our sector which has been at a standstill for almost one year."" In England, the policy only applies to people travelling from ""red list"" countries.  In theory, that means travellers from other countries could avoid quarantine in Scotland by flying to an English airport, then crossing the border into Scotland by road or rail.  Mr Matheson said he had urged the UK government to ""match the comprehensive approach"" in Scotland. Elite athletes are currently exempt from travel restrictions however Mr Matheson said the criteria would be strengthened, to only permit travel for athletes and coaches preparing for the Olympics and Paralympics. A small number of arrivals will not be required to isolate at all, including essential supply chains for goods coming into Scotland, foreign diplomats and essential defence activities. The BBC has approached a number of hotel groups asking whether rooms have been booked for international travellers required to quarantine. A commissioning document was sent out to hotels last week with details of how they can bid to be involved in the quarantine system and what they would need to provide.  The BBC understands governments will book three and four star accommodation with the capacity to provide meals and laundry services. Firms have submitted their proposals and await news on whether bids have been successful in order to bring in staff and reopen buildings, some of which have been closed for months. Premier Inn said it was not one of the 16 hotels so far part of the UK government hotel quarantine scheme. Intercontinental Hotels Group, which owns Holiday Inn, Hotel Indigo and Crowne Plaza brands, declined to comment as did CitizenM, Millennium Hotels, Macdonald Hotels and Travelodge. Radisson Hotel Group said it had ""consistently supported"" local governments and ""provided quarantine services at select properties for travellers and front-line workers"". It added that its safety protocol and ""enhanced operating procedures"" meant it had ""all the necessary measures in place to support and implement quarantine services quickly and safely"". Accor, which owns the Ibis, Novotel and Mercure brands, also suggested it may take part in the scheme. A spokesperson for the firm said discussions were ""well under way"" with the government and hotels  ""ready to support the call for quarantine in order to enable safe travel"". OYO Hotels, which operates venues near Edinburgh and Prestwick airports, said it was ""ready to work with the government"" to provide accommodation in line with the new protocols.

Covid tests for patients before hospital transfers,"Paramedics will test patients for coronavirus at home in a pilot aimed at preventing ""bottleneck"" delays during hospital transfers. Tests to patients going into Covid and non-Covid wards have been carried out at hospitals which has led to handover delays from ambulance crews. Paramedics will test people in Oxford at home to so results are complete ""on or very soon after"" hospital arrival. If the pilot is successful, the strategy will be rolled out further. South Central Ambulance Service (SCAS) said the trial would see all patients aged over 18 tested before being transferred to any of Oxford's hospitals, regardless of whether they display symptoms. The lateral flow test involves placing a swab in the nose and/or mouth which is then mixed with a solution that looks for virus fragments. Droplets are then placed on to a device and a result is delivered within 30 minutes.â¯ Dr John Black, medical director at SCAS, said: ""We expect the use of lateral flow tests pre-hospital to have a direct and positive impact on reducing handover delays, improving bottleneck of patients in the red/Covid-care pathway queue and increase patient hospital flow,"" he said.

Other non-essential shops reopened on 3 February with signs encouraging social distancing and shoppers advised to wear masks inside premises. On Wednesday there were 56 cases of coronavirus in the island, with five new cases on Tuesday. Kira Everett, who runs the Barberette mobile hairdressing service, is relaunching with appointments in St Peter, before heading off around the island.

Anna Lewandowska, from the Glamour House beauty salon in St Helier, she was ""very happy"" to reopen having gone through all her savings to support herself. ""There are queues in the shops again, it's absolutely amazing for the economy,"" she said. Shops that can reopen include: â¯Saunas,â¯steamâ¯rooms,â¯spas and all indoor sports and exercise venues remain closed. Deputy Richard Renouf, Minister for Health and Social Services, urged islanders to ""continue strict adherence"" to social distancing and restrictions on household mixing or ""Covid-19 cases could rise again"". ""Relaxation in one area does not mean Islanders can automatically relax another,"" he said. The government will reconsider restrictions on working from home and the reopening of ""some hospitality services"" on 24 February.

UK's hotel quarantine rules 'inadequate',"Scotland's transport secretary says he is pressing the UK government to close a loophole which could allow travellers to avoid new Covid quarantine rules. Michael Matheson told BBC Scotland the current UK arrangements for enforced isolation in hotels were ""inadequate"". New UK quarantine rules only apply to people arriving from 33 countries deemed ""high risk"", but Scotland's apply to all international travellers. There are fears traveller could avoid the rules by flying into England first. Everyone arriving in Scotland on an international flight from next Monday will have to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days at a cost of Â£1,750. The Scottish government has block-booked rooms at six hotels near Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh airports. Mr Matheson told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme he believed there should be a ""comprehensive system"" across the UK on managed isolation to reduce the risk of importing variants of Covid-19. ""Our preferred option would be for individuals to be required to self-isolate at the point of entry into the UK, rather than travelling from one part of the UK to self-isolate when they get into Scotland or Northern Ireland or any other part of the UK,"" he said. ""[The UK government] want to continue to take a targeted approach on the way in which individuals enter into ports of entry in England. ""Our view is that remains inadequate in order to prevent the risk of new variants entering into the country and that is why we we're continuing to pursue and press the UK government to listen to the clinical advice and expert opinion from the Joint Biosecurity Centre that the existing system operating isn't adequate."" Asked if Scotland would introduce controls on the border with England to ensure people travelling to Scotland via an English airport were complying, Mr Matheson said the Scottish government was looking at a ""range of measures"". The Â£1,750 cost of the stay in managed quarantine will have to be paid for by the passengers themselves. The charge includes mandatory Covid tests on day two and day eight following arrival for one person - any additional travellers will incur supplemental costs.  Anyone who breaches the measures could face criminal charges including culpable and reckless conduct. Mr Matheson told the BBC that about 1,600 people travelled to Scotland from abroad last week. ""If you take out those who would be subject to an exemption, we estimate there would be the need for potentially around 1,200 individuals to self-isolate in a managed quarantine facility,"" he said. ""One of the things that may happen as a result of the policy we have taken forward, is that some of the airlines may choose to draw back on their international flights into Scotland. ""And there is some indication that the airlines may choose to cancel their flights coming into Scotland next week as a result of the managed isolation provision we have put in place, on the basis that they believe the demand for those flights is going to drop off dramatically as a result."" The oil and gas industry has said the 10-day quarantines could have a massive impact on business. Trevor Stapleton, from industry body Oil and Gas UK said: ""Given that they are doing critical roles and that the rotas have been planned a good year in advance, to suddenly say that that individual cannot go offshore - and therefore they have to quarantine for 10 days - would have a couple of outcomes. ""If they are doing a critical role then either they... have to stay on the installation for a further 10 days, and if that's not possible, if the person has to come back, then you are looking quite seriously at whether you can continue to operate that installation."" Mr Matheson said that there would be ""some level of exemptions"" provided for some passengers. ""We're looking at particular aspects around the oil and gas sector and also around areas such as defence and areas of critical infrastructure as well,"" he added. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs on Tuesday that new UK border measures built on ""touch actions"" already taken to prevent news variants of Covid-19 entering the country. He also said that the UK government was working on ""similarly tough schemes with the devolved administrations"".

Outdoor learning centres bid to reopen next term,"By Judith BurnsEducation reporter Overnight education trips should be allowed to resume after Easter, having been suspended in the lockdown, say outdoor learning leaders.   Outdoor education has a vital role in rebuilding children's confidence and mental health after months indoors, they argue.  But centres have been closed for nearly a year, with thousands of jobs lost.  A government spokesman said England's guidance on residential school trips would be reviewed this month.  In the next few weeks, schools are expected to begin to reopen to all pupils on timescales which vary between the four nations of the UK  - and the outdoor education industry hopes to play a part in pupils' educational and emotional recovery from the lockdown.  The School Travel Sector Stakeholder Group was convened by England's Department for Education but represents outdoor education and school travel businesses across the UK.  Its ""Roadmap to Reopening"" proposes a phased restart of domestic educational visits in the summer term. The document argues that the guidance, which has seen overnight educational stays blocked since March 2020, should be amended to allow visits to go ahead, depending on background transmission rates of the virus.  It urges the government to adopt:  The group warns that without these measures the sector could be ""snuffed out"". The group say they are among the sectors hardest hit by the lockdown, having been closed to their main customers for almost a year, even during periods when other businesses, such as pubs, hotels and restaurants, were allowed to open.  ""Our industry is on a knife edge,"" warns Andy Robinson, chief executive of the Institute for Outdoor Learning.  ""If no action is taken and no additional support is provided, the sector stands to lose all its 16,000 jobs, snuffing out a vital British industry."" Alternatively, with the right support, the sector could help boost the self-confidence, resilience and teamwork skills of a generation of children who have been cooped up for almost a year with few opportunities to connect with each other or with nature, the group argues.  ""This is particularly true for disadvantaged children and the thousands of inner-city schools, students and parents for whom outdoor education is a unique and life changing experience,"" says Jim Whittaker, who chairs the Association of Heads of Outdoor Centres. In a statement, the government said: ""Throughout the pandemic, we have kept our guidance on both residential and non-residential visits under review, in line with Public Health England Advice.""  Ministers would be reviewing the guidance ""once again, this month"", said the spokesperson, adding that the furlough scheme had been extended until April, while next month's budget would ""take stock of our wider support, and set out the next stage in our economic response"".

40 jobs at Covid vaccine plant as contract extended,"A Wrexham factory has had its contract to help in the production of Covid-19 vaccines extended by six months, creating 40 new jobs.  The UK government awarded Wockhardt an 18-month contract for the ""fill-and-finish"" stage of manufacture in August. It means production now continue at CP Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Wockhardt, until August 2022. The UK International Trade Secretary said it was ""a brilliant bit of news"" for people in Wrexham.  Liz Truss added: ""It brings important investment to the local area, bringing jobs and security to the community as we battle this awful pandemic."" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said: ""By extending our contract with Wockhardt, we will ensure the UK has uninterrupted fill and finish capacity, guaranteeing we have sufficient supplies to protect the British public in the long-term."" Pharmaceutical company Wockhardt has had a presence in Wrexham for over 20 years and employs over 400 people at its manufacturing facility on Wrexham Industrial Estate.

"When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?","By Nicola Bryan & Peter ShuttleworthBBC News Have you been wondering when you will get your coronavirus vaccine, where you will have it and what to expect?  Public Health Wales figures show more than 630,000 people in Wales so far have had their first jab so far - but when will it be your turn? The Welsh Government's vaccine strategy says everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. Some have said people with mobility issues will find it tough to travel to mass-vaccination centres.  Here is a run down of everything you need to know. The NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young. The Welsh Government said its plans were dependent on Wales receiving vaccine supplies ""in fair proportions and in fair time"". People are asked not to contact their health board, GP, pharmacists or local authority for an appointment and you will be informed by letter about how the process will work in your area. When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?   People will receive a letter, phone call, email or text  from their health board with details of the location where they will receive the vaccination. Invitations will be generated automatically and sent when people are due their vaccination.  As the rollout ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, the first pharmacy in Wales gave the Covid jab as community trials began. There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated in their community, about 250 GP practices across the country will be able to administer the jab by the end of January. Most people will get their vaccine in a primary care setting - so at a GP surgery, pharmacy, optometrist or dentist, the Welsh Government has said.  Vulnerable or at-risk people in high priority groups have been offered the vaccine at the earliest possible opportunity - which might be at one of Wales' mass-vaccination centres. Due to Wales' rural geography, that could mean elderly or people with mobility issues being asked to travel many miles for a jab.  Fay Hopkins, 88, who lives in Abercrave, Powys, has an appointment for a vaccine in Bronllys Hospital, one of the three vaccination centres in Powys - a 62-mile round trip from her home. Her daughter Cathy Anthony said her ""vulnerable"" mother had ""no choice"" but to make the trip. Powys health board said the vaccination centres offered the ""quickest opportunity to receive their first dose of the vaccine"". On Wednesday, the health board announced that all 16 GP practices across Powys would start to call people aged 75-80 to book Covid vaccination appointments. Ms Anthony said: ""I really don't understand why if the community nurses can go into care homes, why can't they go into her home?"" The retired nurse said she has not seen her mother, who lives alone, for months as they have both been shielding since March. ""My mother is not very good at travelling because she gets motion sickness so it is not good for her anyway. She has no choice - she is going to have to otherwise she will miss out. ""My mother is lucky that my brother is well and can take her. I have MS and I am undergoing chemotherapy and my other brother has long Covid. What about people who have no-one?"" Powys health board said: ""We wanted to get invitations out to these priority groups as quickly as possible (all letters to over 80s will have been posted) to give them the earliest opportunity to access the vaccine. ""We do very much recognise the challenges of travel in such a rural county - as well as the understandable desire to receive the vaccine as quickly as possible.  ""This has meant a complex balance between providing as much vaccine as quickly as possible and local access."" If you are offered a vaccine at a mass vaccination and can't get there, call the number on your invite to cancel and wait for a second invite for a jab closer to home. Those who are housebound and in care homes should be able to receive the vaccine from mobile vaccination units. Betsi Cadwaladr's health board has to apologise after queues of up to three hours were reported at the vaccination centre at Ysbyty Enfys in Llandudno. But the Welsh Government said by ""using an appointment system, we hope to minimise queuing at vaccination centres."" There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A third coronavirus vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna - but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures, and can be administered in doctors' surgeries, pharmacies and care homes. Experts have concluded that both vaccines are very effective, and have not stipulated a preference for either one in any specific population. Public Health Wales said everyone will be offered a vaccine that has been approved by the MHRA as safe and effective and recommended by the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) for people of their age or risk group. Public Health Wales said: ""Please try to attend the vaccination centre you are offered. If you cannot attend the centre you are offered you may have to wait to get the vaccine in a more convenient location.""    You will need to bring a face covering, unless you cannot wear one for a health or disability reason, and your booking reference number if your appointment is at a vaccination centre. You will be asked to wait for 15 minutes after having the jab.  This is in the unlikely event you have a serious reaction to the vaccine. You will also be given a leaflet about what to expect after your vaccination. Public Health Wales has said the vaccines are very safe but as with all medicines, side effects can occur. It said most side effects of are mild and short-term, and not everyone gets them. They can include pain at the injection site, feeling tired, a headache, or mild muscle aches.  A less common side effect is swelling of glands, which can occur a few days after the injection, and is a sign the immune system is responding to the vaccination. Anaphylaxis can happen after vaccines or medicines but the vast majority of people will not be at risk. Health professionals are trained to watch out for the early signs and initiate prompt treatment - all immunisation centres include anaphylaxis kits.  Public Health Wales says the benefits of preventing the serious complications of Covid for most people outweigh the risks.  You will be asked if you have ever had any serious allergic reactions before you are offered vaccination. The vaccine is not mandatory and you can choose to take up the offer of a vaccine or not. As of Monday, the Cardiff and Vale health board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80.    Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February. The Hywel Dda health board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80. Powys Teaching health board said letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose. The Swansea Bay board said it was ""on target"" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine ""over the coming weeks"" In north Wales, the Betsi Cadwaladr board said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January. In south east Wales, the Aneurin Bevan board's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63.

Wales' lockdown festival 'to bring much needed joy',"A new Welsh virtual festival is being launched to bring music, laughter and culture into our homes almost a year on from the first lockdown. It will bring together four of Wales' major arts, music and comedy festivals and be broadcast as part of the BBC's Culture in Quarantine initiative. Director of BBC Wales Rhodri Talfan Davies said GÅµyl 2021 would provide a much needed ""blast of creativity"". It will be  online and on BBC Radio Wales and Radio Cymru on 6-7 March. For the first time it has seen Wales' Festival of Voice, one of the UK's most important break-through music events FOCUS Wales, the Aberystwyth Comedy Festival and Other Voices Cardigan join forces to deliver a unique experience. It has been filmed and recorded in line with Covid restrictions in recent months, while the pandemic has kept the public away from arts venues and concerts in Wales. It features well-known Welsh names, including Super Furry Animals frontman Gruff Rhys, musician Cate Le Bon, comedian Kiri Pritchard-McLean, and harpist Catrin Finch, as well as new talent and voices from outside of Wales. Other artists such as the BBC's Sound of 2020 winner Arlo Parks, Welsh Music Prize winners Adwaith, and former BBC Radio 2 Folk Award winners 9Bach will also perform. Exclusive highlights of the Other Voices Cardigan event will also be broadcast on S4C. The line-up was revealed on Wednesday, with the full-time table due to be published shortly. Graeme Farrow, Artistic Director of Wales Millennium Centre, which has had to make job cuts during the pandemic, said the festival would bring ""much needed joy to audiences to blow away the cobwebs."" Henry Widdicombe, of Aberystwyth Comedy Festival, said the past year had been an ""unprecedented challenge for the events industry"" but the festival showed the community had come together as a ""result of the challenge"". Neal Thompson, of Wrexham's FOCUS Wales said: ""After what has been a dark and difficult year for us all, we look forward to a brighter future and to coming together and celebrating Wales' rich and diverse cultural offering, with a programme of outstanding music and comedy.""

Vaccination centres and most schools reopen,"All vaccination centres which closed due to heavy snow falls across Suffolk were due to reopen on Wednesday. The hubs at Trinity Park, Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich, Woodbridge, Debenham, Stowmarket and Bury St Edmunds had shut for two days due to hazardous conditions. The EpiCentre in Haverhill which reopened on Tuesday will also be open. A Met Office yellow warning for snow remains in place across much of the region until 23:59 GMT.  The large vaccination centres at Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich and Chevington Close in Bury St Edmunds are run by the NHS Essex Partnership University Foundation Trust, (EPUFT) and the more localised centres at Trinity Park just east of Ipswich, Woodbridge Community Hall, Debenham Community Centre, The Mix in Stowmarket and the Haverhill centre are run by the Suffolk GP Federation. The EPUFT said that anyone who has an appointment booked and would prefer not to travel in poor weather, can rebook. Suffolk County Council has said another seven rapid coronavirus testing centres are to open in the county by the end of the month, making 10 places where people without symptoms and who cannot work from home can get a test. One centre opens in Felixstowe today, while sites in Martlesham, Mildenhall, Stowmarket, Sudbury, Ipswich and Lowestoft will open in the next few weeks. More than 200 schools, which have been open for children of key workers, had been closed to all pupils on Monday and Tuesday. Most are reopening on Wednesday but some remain closed and are listed on Suffolk County Council's school closures page online.

Prince Charles and Camilla get Covid vaccine,"The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Clarence House has said. It comes a month after the Queen and Prince Philip received their coronavirus jabs. Prince Charles, 72, and Camilla, 73, are in the 70 and over age bracket who are being urged to come forward if they have not yet received the vaccine. The royals are among 12.6 million people in the UK to have received a least one dose of a vaccine so far.  It is not known which vaccine Prince Charles and Camilla received or whether they were vaccinated together.  Prince Charles tested positive for coronavirus in March last year after displaying mild symptoms. The Duchess of Cornwall was also tested at the time but did not have the virus. In June, the Prince of Wales revealed to NHS staff that he had not fully regained his sense of smell and taste two months after having the disease.  It is not fully known what level of protection is offered from a previous coronavirus infection or how long this lasts for. Over-70s are among the 15 million people being vaccinated in the first phase of the UK's immunisation programme. The government has set the target of vaccinating all of these people by 15 February. Several high-profile figures have also publicly revealed they have received the coronavirus jab. Sir Elton John, 73, and Sir Michael Caine, 87, appear in a NHS advert - released on Wednesday - which urges the public to get vaccinated.  The video aims to ""show others that getting the life-saving jab is easy and safe"", according to a statement.

Home-school: Can you get a free laptop or cheaper broadband?,"By Jane WakefieldTechnology reporter  Home-schooling can be impossible for families who do not have internet devices, or a reliable broadband connection, especially when several people need to be online at the same time.  So what help is available? As of 31 January, the government has delivered 927,689 laptops and tablets as part of its bid to get more than a million devices to schools and colleges during the Covid-19 crisis.  Its calculations are based on the number of children entitled to free school meals. Schools requiring devices for their pupils have to place orders via the  Get Help with Technology scheme. Devices are being made available to: According to Ofcom, between 1.1 million and 1.8 million children do not have access to a laptop, desktop or tablet at home, which suggests the government scheme may not be enough. Some private firms and charities are hoping to fill this gap. The London Grid for Learning (LGFL) has a scheme called Bridge the Divide, which is leading a nationwide procurement scheme for two million cheap Chromebooks and WinBooks. The Good Things Foundation's Connecting Families programme delivered 1,870 devices, connectivity and support to families between August and December 2020. In some cases though, demand for devices is outstripping the supply. One academy in Norwich ordered 60 iPads in the summer but has not yet received any.  More than 880,000 children live in a household with only a mobile internet connection, according to the regulator Ofcom, and many of these connections include a limited monthly data allowance. During the first lockdown, the Child Poverty Action Group reported that many parents were burning though their mobile allowance to support their children's learning. This time, mobile operators have promised to zero-rate certain educational sites. So far EE, BT Mobile, Plusnet Mobile, Virgin Mobile, O2, Three and Vodafone have said the online materials provided by the Oak National Academy educational website will be free to access until schools reopen, although only BT has confirmed a start date - the end of January. The concession only applies to content published on the Oak National Academy website itself. Some of its videos are also available on YouTube, but firms cannot offer free access to those without zero-rating all of YouTube, which would seriously damage their business models. BT, Plusnet and EE are also offering free access to  BBC Bitesize resources. BT has asked the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations to each suggest one additional online resource for children in its regions, which it will zero-rate as well.  But Vodafone has said that it does not think it is feasible to ring-fence BBC Bitesize content, and has expressed scepticism that other companies will be able to do it.  There are also strict rules - known as net neutrality - which state that providers should treat all internet traffic equally, although Ofcom is expected to waive this requirement given the circumstances. Hundreds of other educational apps and online resources will continue to cost money to access, so the Department for Education has also agreed with mobile operators that schools and local authorities can request free mobile data increases for some of its families.  Meanwhile, Vodafone is giving 350,000 free data Sim cards to disadvantaged children. According to the Office of National Statistics, only 51% of households earning Â£6,000-Â£10,000 have home internet access compared to 99% of households with an income of more than Â£40,000. As part of its wider Lockdown Learning programme, BT is offering a Â£10 monthly fixed broadband tariff for low-income families called BT Basic.  Meanwhile, superfast provider Hyperoptic - which operates in cities such as London, Leeds and Newcastle - is offering free full-fibre broadband (50mbps) for the rest of the school year to households that are able to get its network.  It hopes to connect at least 2,500 families, and says there will be no obligation to keep the service once the free contract expires. Virgin is giving more than a million customers who pay for speeds under 100MBps a free boost to higher speeds during lockdown. A number of charities and groups are collecting unwanted laptops and tablets for schoolchildren to use at home.  Many schools are accepting equipment directly, but local BBC radio stations are also helping to coordinate donations by liaising with organisations across the UK.  The BBC's Make A Difference: Give A Laptop campaign has seen 17,645 devices donated since 7 January with a further 30,000 devices pledged by businesses across England.

Trust apologises for workers vaccine ‘error’,"By David ThompsonBBC Nolan Show The Belfast Trust has apologised after offering Covid-19 vaccines to community and voluntary groups ahead of other front-line workers. A letter, obtained by The Nolan Show, was sent to organisations in the community and voluntary sector, which are in partnership with the trust.   The only criteria was that staff were ""client-facing"". This included organisations in the arts sector, community groups, relationship counselling and childcare services. The trust was unable to confirm how many vaccines had been given out to those now ineligible. The letter was sent on 21 January. A week later, the trust limited the offer to ""staff working with physiologically vulnerable adults"", for example those with respiratory conditions. The initial policy was reversed after an intervention by the Department of Health. The vaccination programme in Northern Ireland works within the approach agreed across the UK from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which determines the groups that should be prioritised for vaccination, largely based on age and clinical vulnerability.  Belfast Trust is responsible for delivering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The first group vaccinated in Northern Ireland was care home staff and residents, then those 80 years old and over. The aim is to have 65 years and over vaccinated by the end of this month.  In January, it emerged that back office healthcare staff, such as procurement, IT and accounts were able to register for the vaccine as part of the first phase of the rollout. There has been pressure from some front-line workers to be prioritised for the vaccine, including teachers.  Police officers and fire and rescue service staff have yet to be vaccinated. Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, who sits on Stormont's health committee, said news of the letter ""will be very hurtful to those who are CEV (Clinically Extremely Vulnerable) and have shielded away from society for the last 11 months and carers (those who have cared for them) - very, very few from either group have been called forward as yet"".  She also warned that this approach could lead to ""lobbying for many, many other professions, such as bus drivers, retail workers, especially those who work in shops based in hospitals, those who work in meat processing plants... those workplaces where there is a heightened risk of coming into contact with large numbers of people on a daily basis"". A number of organisations within the community and voluntary sector in Belfast had requested the vaccine for their staff. NICVA, which represents the sector, had asked for voluntary and community sector staff to get the vaccination if people in similar jobs in the public sector were being vaccinated. Gerry Tubritt, from the Ballynafeigh Community Development Association, told The Nolan Show that staff who are on the front line delivering food parcels did receive the vaccine in his organisation.  ""It's right and proper that people who are providing front-line grassroots services are offered the vaccine because it protects them and also protects the most vulnerable,"" he said. In a statement, the Belfast Trust said: ""On 21st January 2021 a letter was sent inviting staff working in some community and voluntary sector organisations to book a vaccination appointment.   ""Following a review, it was identified that the trust had issued this letter to some organisations in error.  ""We contacted the groups involved to clarify that only staff working with physiologically vulnerable adults - for example those with heart or respiratory conditions were invited to come forward to have the Covid-19 vaccine.  ""We are truly sorry that this has happened and for any disappointment and frustration this has caused.""

How is the BBC helping home-schooling families?,"The BBC is helping school children keep up with their studies during the latest lockdown.  While primary and secondary schools remain closed to most pupils across the UK, the BBC is broadcasting lessons and educational programmes on CBBC, BBC Two and iPlayer, as well as offering extra content online. Curriculum-based TV programmes are running alongside the BBC Bitesize collection of educational resources, which provide online learning at home for pupils from Years 1 to 9 (P2 to S3 in Scotland), including those studying for GCSE and National exams.   On TV, there are three hours of primary school programming on CBBC every weekday, and two hours for secondary pupils on BBC Two. During the first lockdown in spring 2020, content was available on iPlayer, Red Button services and online, but not on regular television channels. The move to TV came amid concerns many families were struggling to provide the technology and internet connections for their children to take part in online learning. The BBC is offering both lessons and educational programmes.  BBC Bitesize online material includes video lessons, worksheets, quizzes and games to support the curriculum, presented by year-group and by topic.  For primary school pupils, CBBC is broadcasting BBC Bitesize Daily as well as popular programmes such as Our School, Horrible Histories, Art Ninja and Operation Ouch. The Bitesize Daily programmes feature a different subject each week day, including maths, English, science and French. There are separate programmes for five-to-seven year-olds, seven-to-nine year-olds and those aged nine to 11.  The Celebrity Supply Teacher programme features guests including footballer Marcus Rashford on PE, astronaut Tim Peake on science, singer Kelis on cooking, and dancer Darcey Bussell.  BBC Two is catering for secondary students, with new content to support the curriculum, including BBC Bitesize Secondary programmes plus drama adaptations, science, history and factual titles. Over half term, the lockdown learning television programmes will be off air for two weeks, returning on Monday 1 March.  However, all previous programmes will remain available on iPlayer, and all online lessons and resources will be accessible on the BBC Bitesize website.  Online - learning resources for children of all ages can be found on the BBC Bitesize website. TV - programming for primary school pupils is on CBBC between 09:00 and 12.00 every weekday. Programmes for secondary school pupils is on BBC Two, between 13:00 and 15:00.  Red Button - the Bitesize Daily lessons will also be shown on the Red Button service on TV.  iPlayer - all episodes will be available on catch-up, via iPlayer. For primary and secondary pupils in Scotland, there is also dedicated programming online and on BBC Scotland from 10:00, every weekday for about two hours. This includes BBC Bitesize Scotland programmes.  For children studying in Welsh, there is bilingual support on the BBC Bitesize website, with activities to support home learning. Go to the ""change language"" button and select the Welsh language to access it. There are also Welsh language Bitesize programmes on iPlayer.  Pupils in Northern Ireland can go to the ""Learning from home"" section of the BBC Northern Ireland website to find more information to help their studies. There are also BBC Bitesize Northern Ireland programmes on iPlayer for primary pupils and secondary pupils. Customers using BT Mobile, EE, and Plusnet Mobile can use BBC Bitesize content without eating into their data allowance. More mobile companies are also expected to make such content free to use. The BBC Bitesize Facebook and Twitter accounts are focusing on parents and teachers, including articles on supporting children's learning from home. And the Bitesize Instagram and TikTok platforms are there for teenage students - offering both useful explainers and some material designed to make you smile.

Sports equipment presents 'low Covid risk',"By Laura ScottBBC Sport The risk of coronavirus transmission from sharing sports equipment is ""lower than once thought"", a study suggests. Researchers, led by Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, applied live virus particles to nine types of sports equipment and a control material. They concluded it ""seems unlikely"" that sports balls and accessories are a major cause for transmission. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last June that cricket balls are a ""natural vector"" of coronavirus. The Strike study found the virus was least transferrable on absorbent materials like cricket gloves and tennis balls, compared with non-porous equipment like racing saddles and rugby balls. The researchers found that there was ""rapid decay"" of viral particles across several types of equipment, and it was ""very difficult"" to transfer live virus back off it. ""Close contact"" between players is likely to be a more important mode of spreading the virus than sharing equipment, researchers concluded. James Calder, from Imperial College and Fortius Clinic, said: ""The findings in this study are important not only for elite athletes, but also for community sports and our schools.  ""It shows that the risk of transmission when sharing sports equipment is lower than was once thought and it highlights the importance of promoting other infection control measures in sports, whilst urging equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may be less likely to retain viable virus."" During the study a low dose and a high dose of live coronavirus was applied to a cricket glove, a football, a golf ball, a piece of gym pit foam, a horse saddle, both red and white cricket balls, a rugby ball and a tennis ball, as well as a piece of stainless steel as a control material. Each was tested after one minute, five minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 90 minutes, to see whether live virus could be transferred off the equipment at time points that were relevant to sports events. When the low dose was applied, virus was recoverable on seven of the 10 items tested after one minute, one of the 10 after five minutes - the horse saddle - and none of the 10 after 15 minutes. When the high dose was applied, virus was recoverable on nine out of the 10 items after one and five minutes - all except the cricket glove - six out of 10 after 30 minutes, and two out of 10 after 90 minutes (the rugby ball and horse saddle). However, the study - which is awaiting peer review - found that the ""mean recovery of the virus fell across all materials to 0.74% at one minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes"". Dr Emily Adams, a senior lecturer at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said: ""Anything that is slightly absorbent like a tennis ball or some of the leathery cricket balls, it's very difficult to transfer any live virus off those. So we think that transmission from sports equipment is probably very low in these cases.  ""Basically in many sports, like tennis, really the public health intervention should be focused on players and how players interact before a game, during a game and after a game and in transport rather than the sports equipment itself."" The study found there was a ""noticeable"" difference in the viral recovery of red and white cricket balls. ""Despite the white and red cricket ball surfaces both being composed of bovine leather, the different coatings used to finish the surfaces (synthetic grease on the red ball, nitrocellulose on the white ball) had a noticeable effect on viral recovery, with the red ball having a lower level"", it says. The study concludes that, given the differences in virus transfer between the types of sports equipment, the findings could ""direct the engineering of materials that retain and absorb virus"" as opposed to water-repellent materials, where the ability to transfer virus particles back off a surface is greater.

Cancer therapy with no visitors is 'hardest thing',"Covid restrictions have made this year much tougher for young people already dealing with a cancer diagnosis.  Sophie, like many other young cancer patients, has had to attend appointments and treatments alone, with no family or friends at her side.  ""My mum was crying, I was crying and she had to leave me at the door and drive off,"" the 24-year-old says. Last year, she was told she would need hospital treatment for five weeks, 70 miles away from home.   ""We had to travel to Manchester so my mum drove me,"" Sophie says. ""We got to the door and I had my suitcase - I was struggling alone with this suitcase. ""My mum was terrified leaving me, because she was probably thinking, 'I can't be there to comfort her,' and as well, if things go wrong, would she be walking back out of the hospital?""  Rules on who can visit have varied at different hospitals throughout the pandemic but official NHS England advice is that young cancer patients should be able to have friends and family supporting them at appointments in a Covid-safe way. Mikaela, 18, from Frome, needed treatment for cancer last March.  She had three weeks of radiotherapy, fertility treatment to freeze her eggs and a biopsy operation.   Mikaela's mother was able to go with her for a couple of chemotherapy sessions - but lockdown rules changed that. And Mikaela had to attend appointments - and have a stem-cell transplant - alone.  Kathryn, 22, from Gwernaffield, in Flintshire, who has Hodgkin lymphoma, says the prospect of being isolated in hospital for up to six weeks without any of her family being there is difficult to comprehend.  ""It's going to be extremely difficult going from shielding at home with my mum, dad and my brother around to not having my family there in person,"" she says. ""I know from friends going through similar things that having family there is really important - and I won't have that at all.""  An NHS England spokesperson said it was ""absolutely clear that young cancer patients should be able to have friends and family supporting them at appointments, which is why the national guidance is explicit that this should be offered, in a Covid-safe way.""  ""It is important that families know cancer treatment is continuing across the country, so that young people can come forward for the care they need, with the right support."" A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said: ""This pandemic is a uniquely challenging time, and we know it is particularly difficult for people who are suffering with a critical illness. ""The health, safety and wellbeing of patients is our top priority and we are committed to supporting the needs of patients by taking a compassionate approach that makes hospital visits possible, whilst managing the risk of infection.  ""To make sure patients are given the care and support they need, our current guidance recommends that patients can be accompanied where appropriate and necessary, providing it happens in a Covid-secure way. "" Two cancer charities - Teenage Cancer Trust and Clic Sargent - have written a letter to cancer ministers in the UK's four nations to highlight the issue.  Dr Louise Soanes, from Teenage Cancer Trust, said: ""Having cancer treatment, receiving a diagnosis or learning or hearing how you're responding to treatment can be for many a scary and isolating experience.  ""Young people then need to share often very complex information - some of which they might be still processing - with family members, friends or a partner.   ""That's why we want to dispel the disparity so all young people, where safe and possible, have that crucial loved one with them and a hand to hold, particularly during some of the most difficult times of their life.""

Trio fined for 150-mile drive to 'photograph view',"Three men have been fined for making a 300-mile (483km) round trip from London to a Shropshire beauty spot to ""take a photograph of the view"". West Mercia Police said the trio had not even managed to snap a picture as their phone batteries had died. They were stopped and questioned in Little Stretton, south Shropshire, having driven from Kensington. The trio were given Covid fixed penalty notices with police saying it would be the ""only souvenir"" of the trip. Police have a legal duty to make sure national lockdown rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers.

Surge testing after Covid variant found in Lambeth,"Surge testing is being deployed in Lambeth after a case of the South African variant was discovered. People in areas with postcodes SE27 0, SE27 9 and SW16 2 , are ""strongly encouraged"" to take a coronavirus test, even if they are not showing symptoms. On-the-spot doorstep tests, home testing kits and mobile testing will be deployed to the south London area. The Department of Health said the move will help ""control and suppress the spread"" of the Covid-19 variant. It comes a week after the London areas of Tottenham Hale, Pollards Hill and West Ealing were singled out for enhanced testing for the South African variant. People in these areas are told to further limit the time they spend away from home, according to government advice. Positive cases will be sequenced for genomic data to help understand Covid-19 variants and their spread within these areas. Lambeth Council said: ""This is to help us track any potential cases after a case of the variant of Covid-19, that was first identified in South Africa, was discovered in the area."" There are now many thousands of variants of the pandemic virus circulating. But experts are concerned about the South African variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351. There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. Public Health England said 170 cases of the South African variant had been identified so far, including 18 that are not linked to travel.

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. Care home staff were not given personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed. Between March and July 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care provided NHS trusts with 1.9 billion items of PPE, the equivalent to 80% of estimated need. The adult social care sector was given 331 million items - just 10% of its need. At the same time, about 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes from hospitals without being tested for Covid-19. Last month, our political editor Laura Kuenssberg interviewed a care home owner who said Covid ""hit the home like a missile"" last year. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) is asking the government for a clear timeline for reopening and a ""roadmap to recovery"". The BBPA said trading restrictions and lockdowns knocked sales by 56% - worth Â£7.8bn - last year. ""There's been a real lack of clarity,"" said Dianne Irving, who manages three pubs in Carlisle. ""It's just really, really difficult to know where we are and where we are going."" Under Tier 1 last year - the mildest of restrictions - two of her pubs were only breaking even, with her city-centre venue making a loss, she said. The government says it has a plan for reopening the economy, which it will reveal after 22 February. Meet Dr Sarah Marsh, Argjira Luzha and Becky Leigh - three people fighting Covid-19 at Harrogate Hospital's intensive care unit.

Europe's oldest person has survived Covid-19, just days before her 117th birthday. Lucile Randon, a French nun who took the name Sister Andre in 1944, tested positive for coronavirus on 16 January but didn't develop any symptoms. She told local media she ""didn't even realise I had it"". ""She has been very lucky,"" a spokesman for her retirement home said.

'We found a connection in a Covid ICU',"Two NHS workers say they have ""found a connection in the middle of chaos"" after striking up a relationship on an intensive care unit. Helen Birch said she ""really struggled"" to balance work and being a single mum to a five-year-old boy during Covid. Since meeting Ollie Foster, an ICU nurse at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital, they have ""got each other through it"". They met when Ms Birch volunteered to help on the ward, and she said their colleagues are thrilled at the romance. ""We had a really tough night shift together, but we just gelled and got each other through it,"" she said. ""I didn't think anything of it, but then heard people talking about how Ollie had a big crush on me. ""Everyone says it's just what we need."" The operating department practitioner, who normally works at the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital, near Oswestry, said: ""Covid needs to get lost, so we can go on some proper dates."" Mr Foster has promised her dinner at an Italian restaurant and the pair have also discovered a shared passion for castles, so have drawn a list of where they will visit as soon as they are able. Although they work together, Ms Birch said the rules on them mixing are not very clear, so they are sticking to the rules. ""We just try and catch moments where we can,"" she said. ""A coffee before work, and we talk on the phone. ""He makes me feel like a teenager."" Ms Birch said she ""really struggled"" with earlier lockdowns - she is a single parent and her family and close friends live miles from her, but she said she ""tried not to complain"". ""A lot of people don't understand what we do and what it's like,"" she said.  ""With Ollie, I don't even have to talk to him, he just gets it.""

'While in hospital I lost my daughter-in-law',"By Mark HutchingsBBC Radio 5 Live ""I feel so sorry because I'm 20 years older and I'm still here"". Betty Tovey, 94, was being treated at a field hospital for Covid-19 when her daughter-in-law died with the virus. Now she is ready to go home after six weeks, Betty is looking forward to returning to Penygroes, but it is an occasion marked with sadness. She and other patients have spoken to BBC 5Live, which was given extensive access inside the temporary hospital, housed in a Llanelli bowling centre.  ""I kept praying, please God let me go home to them, but unfortunately she was taken,"" Betty continued. She shared her story along with a series of other patients at the Carmarthenshire facility, in the week the number of deaths with coronavirus in Wales passed 5,000. On the last six weeks, she said: ""I don't remember a lot, there's lots of things I'd like to remember. ""I just wanted to go to sleep, but thankfully the Lord doesn't want me yet, I've got to go home and help my son, he's lost his wife."" When the coronavirus pandemic struck nearly a year ago, facilities all over the country from sports stadia to theatres were rapidly converted into field hospitals, in a bid to relieved the pressure on hospital wards across Wales. About 12 weeks ago, Hywel Dda University Health Board opened Ysbyty Enfys Selwyn Samuel in Llanelli and Ysbyty Enfys Carreg Las in Pembrokeshire, as a ""step-down"" facilities to help ease pressure on hospital beds. At the Selwyn Samuel centre the bowling floor has been transformed into a ""recovery"" hospital ward with 42 patients being treated, mostly in the final stages of recovering from Covid-19. Staff working here are helping to get patients - many of them elderly - back up on their feet, eating and drinking, and doing laps of the bowling floor, ready for the day they can go home. Ceri-Ann Jones was getting ready for a shift in a pub when the first nationwide lockdown was announced, on 23 March. Now, after hearing the pressure the NHS has been under, she is helping care for Betty and other patients after starting work as a domestic assistant on the ward. ""I thought I was fit and healthy, to a degree, and when Covid started kicking off... if you could get your hands dirty and help out, why not?"". Ceri-Ann said that working on the ward had opened her eyes and she now wanted to train to become a nurse, to keep caring for people in the future. She said she would like to bring people who did not believe Covid-19 existed on to the ward to see the lasting impact on patients' and staffs' lives. ""I look at it and think, if my parents or my grandparents were in this situation, how would I want them to be treated, ""she said. ""It's knowing you've made a difference... why wouldn't you want to put a smile on someone's face."" Charles Hughes spent about three weeks in hospital, but said he had been told about it by his son and does not remember ""a day"" of his time there. But, the 88-year-old said he felt like he was getting better in the hospital. ""I'm well looked after, it's a palace... with the staff, with the food, everything, I couldn't be better well looked after,"" he said. Sarah Williams, a nurse of 32-years, never imagined working in a ward inside a bowling centre, but working with the patients - more than 100 of whom have been treated in 12 weeks - was very rewarding. While it had been positive helping people get ready to go home, the work had been ""challenging at times"", especially with some of her family also contacting the virus. ""There are some really sad stories but there are a lot of positives as well,"" she said. ""The focus is getting them up and about, eating and drinking, giving them that extra care that they need before they go home to the care setting. ""It's a very positive experience for the patients to get that extra bit of care before they go home."" Dr Meinir Jones, field hospitals clinical lead, said facilities like this field hospital, used to provide an extra level of care before a patient is discharged, were what was needed to ""maintain flow"" in hospitals. The model is different from England's Nightingale Hospital approach, which were temporary hospitals used to provide critical care for patients. She said that while the Llanelli facility could not be used for intensive care, because of workforce issues and technical medical equipment, it had helped to ease pressure. ""It's not just how long a patient spends in intensive care, it's about what happens afterwards... they spend a lot longer on wards afterwards,"" she said. ""I think we have in Wales been able to successfully adopt that step-down model."" Are field hospitals operating in Wales? Will virus variant force the Nightingales to open?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-55999628,1
Labour backbenchers blast free school meals snub,"By Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent More children in Wales should get free school meals, backbench Labour Senedd members have said. A Plaid Cymru amendment to next year's draft budget was voted down in a debate in the Senedd on Tuesday. It would have seen free school meals extended to all pupils whose families receive Universal Credit, which First Minister Mark Drakeford has resisted. But Labour Member of the Senedd (MS) Alun Davies said the Welsh Government was on the ""wrong side"" of the debate. Ministers should ""commit to looking at"" the proposal ""and looking at how much it's going to cost and where the money is going to come from"", Labour MS Mike Hedges added. The amendment said the extra costs could be paid for out of funds the Welsh Government has set aside to combat coronavirus. Mr Davies said the amendment was ""broadly right"", adding: ""The government is on the wrong side of this argument and I hope that the government will recognise that and I hope that the government will, in returning to the chamber, recognise its position is neither sustainable nor credible on that particular matter."" Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said: ""I hope those colleagues who have talked on this issue today will be supporting our budget when we come to the final budget. ""I will say it's important that we continue to explore all the options available to us and seek to build on the actions that we've already taken. ""But I do recognise also that it has to be within the context of the budgetary constraints that we are under."" Using money earmarked for fighting the pandemic involved ""trade-offs"" that could leave less for the NHS or local councils, Ms Evans argued. ""These are the serious decisions and serious choices we have to make when we are calling for additional funding for parts of the budget,"" she added. The Welsh Government has extended free school meals during the holidays until Easter 2022. Footballer Marcus Rashford welcomed it as ""a great move"" when it was announced in December.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-56004239,1
Hospital criticised over emergency unit PPE lapses,"Staff in a hospital emergency department failed to stick to social distancing guidance and did not use personal protective equipment (PPE) appropriately, inspectors found. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) has downgraded the emergency department's rating at the Royal Oldham Hospital. It said one staff member ""interacted closely"" with patients without using gloves, washing hands or changing PPE. The hospital's chief nursing officer apologised to patients and the public. The CQC inspection on 30 November found several breaches of coronavirus protocols. Its report said a member of staff took a patient's history on the respiratory corridor without wearing eye protection. Inspectors also saw a relative being directed to the urgent treatment centre without any Covid screening. The department was downgraded from a rating of ""good"" to ""requiring improvement"" following the inspection. The CQC wrote to the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, afterwards ""because we were concerned about the potential significant risk of harm to patients"". It said the trust ""took immediate action to address our concerns"". The CQC acknowledged at the time the North West was experiencing ""significant levels of Covid 19-related pressure"" but said it carried out its unannounced inspection partly due to concerns from staff and public concerns about the safety and quality of services. The CQC said inspectors saw department staff not adhering to hand hygiene protocols ""on multiple occasions"". Social distancing was also identified as a problem in corridors for staff, patients and ambulance crews, with patients on trolleys positioned head-to-toe. Ann Ford, CQC's deputy chief inspector for the north, said hospital staff were working hard to provide care to patients under challenging Covid-19 related pressure. ""Both staff and patients told us they were concerned about the safety of care being delivered in the urgent and emergency department,"" she added. Libby McManus, group chief nursing officer for the Northern Care Alliance NHS Group, which the trust is part of, said the infection control was neither acceptable nor at its usual high standard. ""Our teams have used this report to make the necessary improvements and share learning across our organisation,"" she said. The CQC said it would continue to monitor the trust.

Care home staff 'without PPE at start of pandemic',"Care home staff were without personal protective equipment (PPE) early in the pandemic because the government prioritised the NHS, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said care homes received only a fraction of the PPE needed compared with the health service. It said social care ""was only taken seriously after the high mortality rate in care homes became apparent"". The government said it worked ""tirelessly"" to provide PPE. The report from the Public Accounts Committee said many healthcare workers were put in an ""appalling situation"" where they had to care for people with Covid-19 or suspected Covid-19 ""without sufficient PPE to protect themselves from infection"". It said the social care sector did not receive ""anywhere near enough"" to meet its needs. Health and social care staff suffered PPE shortages, it said, with some forced to reuse single-use items as stocks ran ""perilously low"". Between March and July 2020, the Department of Health and Social Care provided NHS trusts with 1.9 billion items of PPE, the equivalent to 80% of their estimated need. The adult social care sector was given 331 million items, accounting for 10% of its requirements. At the same time, about 25,000 patients were discharged to care homes from hospitals without being tested for Covid-19. ""This contributed significantly to the deaths in care homes during the first wave,"" the committee said. Its report said the government had believed it was well placed to cope at the start of the outbreak, as it had a stockpile of PPE. But this was only intended for a flu pandemic and was ""inadequate"" for the coronavirus pandemic. More than Â£12bn was spent by the Department of Health and Social Care between February and July 2020 on 32 billion items of PPE. However, the committee said hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money was ""wasted"" on unusable kit. Staff reported receiving face masks with rotten elastic and, in one case, a box of surgical gowns which was infested with insects. Committee chairman Meg Hillier said frontline workers were left ""without adequate supplies, risking their own and their families' lives to provide treatment and care"". ""The government needs to acknowledge the errors and be better prepared,"" she said. The report came after two highly critical reports published by the National Audit Office in November last year. In a statement, the Department of Health and Social Care said it worked ""tirelessly to procure, produce and deliver PPE"" to frontline workers.

""I like to think of porter as short for transporter - as a lot of what we can do is moving stuff from A to B. ""We take patients, blood, swabs and all the essentials from one part of the hospital to another."" He has been working as a porter since July 2019, when his fiancee (who also works at the hospital, in HR) saw the job advertised.   Little did either of them know just over six months into the role, he'd be working on the front line of a pandemic.  ""The job was already busy, but when Covid happened it got crazy. ""The second wave has been manicâ¦ you can work non-stop some days - walking everywhere and pushing stuff around. It is exhausting. ""It doesn't worry me working here, especially as we've got all the correct PPE."" But the job has made it difficult for Joe to see vulnerable family members. ""My family think it's good I'm helping out. My mum has multiple sclerosis so I guess I always grew up caring for people."" But it's also meant he hasn't been able to see her much since the start of the pandemic. ""Ultimately I have to think about keeping mum safe."" Joe says people don't always see what goes on ""behind the curtain"" in places like hospitals. ""People appreciate the NHS - but people don't really think about the porters,"" he says. ""Some people think all we do is collect specimens but there's also the not-so-pleasant side to the job."" When he started the job, he expected collecting bodies would be the worst part, but the reality was very different. ""But personally the thing I struggle with the most is when I go onto a ward and someone is suffering with dementia - they are scared and shouting for help."" ""There'll be someone else there to help them, but as a porter you just have to ignore it and naturally you want to help."" Joe says to keep himself going he uses humour, and tries to keep a positive outlook.  Beaming from behind his mask he tells us: ""You just always have to try and look on the bright side, and know that patients are in the best place they can be.""

How Serbia soared ahead in Covid vaccinations,"By Guy DelauneyBBC News, Balkans correspondent Serbia's US-educated prime minister was the first European leader to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The country's Russophile internal affairs minister rolled up his sleeve for an armful of Sputnik V. And the health minister happily posed for his injection with Sinopharm's coronavirus shot.  These photo-ops were a way of reassuring a sceptical Serbian population about the safety of vaccinations. But they also illustrated an omnivorous approach to procurement that has put Serbia at the front of the race to inoculate people in continental Europe. ""Whether [vaccines] come from China, the US or EU - we don't care as long as they're safe and we get them as soon as possible,"" Prime Minster Ana Brnabic tells the BBC.  ""For us, vaccination is not a geopolitical matter. It is a healthcare issue.""  Such pragmatism has paid off handsomely. Other countries in the Western Balkans have struggled to secure any vaccine supplies, having placed their hopes on the EU or the international Covax scheme. In contrast, Serbia looks on target to inoculate at least a tenth of its population by the middle of February.   It is also speeding ahead of all the 27 EU member states - performing vaccinations at around double the rate of Germany, Spain and Italy and four times the speed of the Netherlands.  While the prime minister may insist there is no room for geopolitics when it comes to coronavirus, Belgrade's warm relations with Beijing and Moscow have undoubtedly helped bring in quantities of vaccine that EU countries can only envy.   ""I would be equally happy if we got a million vaccines from Pfizer,"" says Ms Brnabic. ""But our foreign policy paid off; I think it was smart and I have to say I'm proud of what we achieved."" ""We are not an EU member, and with all the solidarity there is in the EU, we are bound to be the last to get the vaccines from the EU. That's the downside of not being an EU member, and the strategic focus of my government remains EU accession.""  But in this moment of crisis, not relying on Brussels for vaccine procurement has been a boon for Serbia. At Belgrade's sprawling World Trade Centre, people who have registered online join a fast-moving queue to get their jabs. The efficiency of the process has raised eyebrows in a country not renowned for dynamic public administration.   ""I'm surprised,"" says 70-year-old Slavic Radonovic. ""I'm a retired health worker and I know that the health sector is good, but I'm surprised with the level of organisation and massive presence of health workers.""  For Brussels, the optics are not so favourable, as the world sees an EU candidate country conspicuously benefiting from its ties to the East. And, not for the first time, countries in the Western Balkans have discovered that when the chips are down, the EU can be an unreliable partner.   ""The EU is not present here, in terms of a serious political strategy,"" says Vuk Vuksanovic of the Belgrade Centre for Security Policy think-tank.   At least one EU country, Hungary, is following Serbia's example by procuring Chinese and Russian vaccines. Others may take the same approach.   For once, Serbia can enjoy showing the rest of the continent how things should be done.  How will Covid vaccines be shared around the world?

Europe's oldest person survives Covid aged 116,"A French nun who is Europe's oldest person has survived Covid-19, just days before her 117th birthday. Lucile Randon, who took the name of Sister Andre in 1944, tested positive for coronavirus on 16 January but didn't develop any symptoms. She told local media she ""didn't even realise I had it"". She isolated separately from other residents in her retirement home in Toulon, southern France, but is now considered fully recovered. Sister Andre, who is blind and uses a wheelchair, is now looking forward to celebrating her birthday on Thursday - although she is going to mark the occasion with a smaller group of residents than usual. ""She has been very lucky,"" David Tavella, spokesman for the Sainte Catherine LabourÃ© retirement home, said.  He told Var Matin newspaper: ""She didn't ask me about her health, but about her habits. For example, she wanted to know if meal or bedtime schedules would change.  ""She showed no fear of the disease. On the other hand, she was very concerned about the other residents."" Sister Andre was born on 11 February 1904. As well as being Europe's oldest person, she is also the second-oldest living person in the world, according to the Gerontology Research Group's (GRG) World Supercentenarian Rankings List. When asked by French broadcaster BFM if she was scared of having Covid, Sister Andre said: ""No, I wasn't scared, because I wasn't scared to die. ""I'm happy to be with you, but I would wish to be somewhere else - to join my big brother, and my grandfather and my grandmother.""

"Travellers face £1,750 cost for quarantine hotels","Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels in England will be charged Â£1,750 for their stay, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced. The measures, which come into force on Monday, apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries. Those who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel for 10 days face fines of up to Â£10,000. Meanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels.  People travelling from red list countries to Wales and Northern Ireland will be required to book and pay for quarantine in England, as neither destination currently has any direct international flights. Travellers arriving into England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a fine of Â£10,000 or up to 10 years in jail. It comes as the UK reported another 12,364 confirmed cases of coronavirus and a further 1,052 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - bringing that total to 113,850. More than 12.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine. Delivering a statement in the Commons, Mr Hancock said 16 hotels have been contracted for the programme, with 4,600 rooms secured. The health secretary also confirmed a new ""enhanced testing"" regime for all travellers arriving into the UK would begin on Monday, with two tests required during the quarantine process. They will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The tests, conducted by NHS Test and Trace, will cost travellers Â£210. ""People who flout these rules are putting us all at risk,"" the health secretary told MPs. Airlines and travel companies will be legally required to make sure travellers have signed up for the new measures before they depart, with fines for companies and passengers if they fail to comply, he said. The penalties include a Â£1,000 fine for travellers who fail to take mandatory tests and a Â£2,000 fine for failing to take the second mandatory test - along with a 14-day extension to quarantine. Failing to quarantine in a designated hotel carries a fine of between Â£5,000 and Â£10,000. Asked when the travel rules would be relaxed, Mr Hancock said: ""We want to exit from this into a system of safe international travel as soon as practicable and as soon as is safe."" Passengers required to stay in a quarantine hotel will need to reserve a room online in advance using a booking system that opens on Thursday. The Â£1,750 fee for an individual includes the hotel, the cost of transport and testing. The additional rate for one extra adult or a child aged over 12 is Â£650, and for a child aged five to 12 it is Â£325. These travellers will only be allowed to enter the UK through a ""small number of ports that currently account for the vast majority of passenger arrivals"", Mr Hancock added. Responding to Mr Hancock's statement, Labour's shadow health secretary said the public wanted the government to ""go further"" on border quarantine measures. Jonathan Ashworth told the Commons: ""Our first line of defence is surely to do everything we can to stop (new variants) arising in the first place. That means securing our borders to isolate new variants as they come in.  ""He's announced a detailed package today but he hasn't announced comprehensive quarantine controls at the borders."" Mr Hancock later said the red list was kept ""under review"".  Announcing Scotland's tougher measures, which apply to arrivals from all countries, Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said the ""targeted, reactive approach"" of the UK government was ""no longer sufficient"" to deal with the threat from coronavirus. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford said he also wanted to see ""a stronger set of defences at our borders"" and said the UK government's measures were ""the bare minimum of what needs to be done"". Enforcement fines and prison sentences over quarantine breaches are still ""under review"" in Wales. A Welsh government spokesperson also said the country was working to determine when it will need its own quarantine hotels, if the red list expands or if international flights resume.  Although the 4,600 rooms secured so far in England would only allow for around one Boeing 747's worth of passengers per day, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of UK Hospitality, said discussions were under way to add more capacity.  She told BBC Radio 4's World at One that separate security teams contracted by the government would be responsible for enforcing the quarantine, while hotel staff focused on giving people the ""best possible experience in what are very difficult circumstances"". The Â£1,750 fee includes three meals, tea, coffee and water, Ms Nicholls said, but other items will be available at an extra cost through room service. Travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - are already required to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. This test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. They must also provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate.  All travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK. The ""test to release scheme"" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules. Passengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests. Lockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons. These are the same as the ""reasonable excuses"" for domestic travel, including: People leaving England will soon have to make a declaration on why they need to travel, which will be checked by carriers prior to departure. The new measures come after England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing, he said: ""The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,"" he said. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say."" After the announcement of the travel rules, aimed at preventing the spread of new variants of coronavirus, government advisers designated another ""variant of concern"" - a version of the virus which was revealed last week to have been found in Bristol. It's not surprising that officials are adding this new version of coronavirus to their ""variants of concern"" list.  Targeted testing is already under way to spot any new cases linked to the 21 that have already been found, mostly in the south west of England. This new incarnation of the virus is the Kent variant ""plus"". It has the same N501Y mutation as the one that triggered lockdown - a genetic change that scientists say lets the virus spread more easily. But it also has an extra mutation called E484K. E484K is what experts are worried about for vaccine efficacy. It is also seen in the South Africa and Brazil variants of concern.  A cluster of another variant in Liverpool is different again. It has got the E484K mutation but is an iteration of an earlier version of the pandemic virus rather than the Kent one. Inevitably, more variants will continue to emerge. The challenge is to make sure vaccines are a good match to keep us ahead in this race against the virus.  Have you recently travelled into the UK? What was your experience at the UK border?

South Asian Covid death rates ‘alarming’,"Black people in England have been no more likely than white people to die of Covid-19 in the second wave of the pandemic, official data shows. During the first wave, people belonging to ethnic minorities experienced higher death rates than white people.   The Office for National Statistics (ONS) found that, for black people, this gap had closed. But Bangladeshi and Pakistani people still experienced three times the risk. Researchers from the ONS, University of Oxford, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and University of Leicester said widespread reports that people belonging to ethnic minorities were disproportionately affected by Covid-19 may have raised awareness. But for South Asian people, particularly from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds, the raised mortality rate remained ""alarming"".  The study used official data on 28.9 million people aged between 30 and 100 living in private households in England between the first wave (from January until the end of August 2020) and the second wave (from September to the end of December 2020). In the first wave, people from a black African background had the highest age-standardised Covid-19 mortality rates - with the rate for black African men almost five times higher than the rate for white British men. But in the second wave, black people were not at higher risk of dying than white people, as they had been during the first wave. The researchers said this showed ""ethnic inequalities in Covid-19 mortality can be addressed"". However, South Asian people had up to about a five-times greater risk of death with coronavirus compared with white British people - ranging from a 4.8-fold increase in the risk of dying for Pakistani men to 1.6 times higher for Indian women.  The findings were presented in a preprint but have not been formally published yet. A number of different factors have been suggested for why some ethnic groups have been hit harder than others by the pandemic: These factors will be different for different groups - but they also appeared to change during the pandemic.  During the first wave, ""geographical factors explained a large proportion of the differences in Covid-19 mortality,"" said the team, lead by VahÃ© Nafilyan at the ONS and Nazrul Islam at the University of Oxford. In other words, people from minority ethnic groups were more likely to live in areas harder hit by the virus. But this was not the case in the second wave - and even after they adjusted for factors like health status, income and deprivation, the risk of dying of Covid remained ""substantially higher"" for people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds. This suggested, the paper said, that ""focusing on treating underlying conditions, although important, may not be enough in reducing the inequalities in Covid-19 mortality.""  It said ""a focused public health policy as well as community mobilisation and a participatory public health campaign involving community leaders may help reduce the existing and widening inequalities.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-56002506,1
First quarantine site gave team 'head start',"The team behind the UK's first coronavirus quarantine centre, which hosted evacuees from Wuhan a year ago, said it gave them a ""head start"" on learning how to deal with the virus. Expatriates from the virus epicentre in China spent 14 days at Kents Hill Park conference centre in Milton Keynes. The centre was set up with two days' notice. Sam Donohue, deputy chief nurse at Milton Keynes University Hospital, said it was ""like a military operation"". ""We had two days to do what we needed to do to bring these people safely home,"" Ms Donohue said. ""The people at the middle of this were probably terrified. ""Logistically it was like a military operation. ""It was exhilarating and something I'll never forget but I hope to never go through again either."" Ian Reckless, medical director at Milton Keynes University Hospital, said the preparation and running of the site went ""incredibly smoothly"". ""It was quite a challenge at the time and we recognised we were doing something extraordinary,"" he said. ""It gave us an idea of what it might look like when the virus hit our shores. ""At that point in time we had a bit of a head start thinking about how we would bring a patient with coronavirus to the hospital if we needed to."" None of those evacuated to the conference centre tested positive for coronavirus. But the second patient to die with the virus in the UK did so at Milton Keynes Hospital. ""Our experience of coronavirus in Milton Keynes got going very quickly,"" Mr Reckless said. Up to 8 February there have been 414 Covid-19 deaths registered at Milton Keynes University Hospital. Nicky Burns Muir, the chief nurse at Milton Keynes University Hospital, said it was not until staff left the quarantine centre that ""things started to ramp up"" with coronavirus. But she said the vaccination rollout had brought a ""sense of hope"" to hospital staff. The hospital's chief executive Prof Joe Harrison said it was starting to see a reduction in the number of coronavirus patients after a challenging few months. ""I'm quite optimistic about the future and I think this has shown us just how great our NHS can be, "" he said. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

GPs advise over-70s not to call for vaccine jabs,"Some surgeries have asked people not to call for Covid-19 vaccines after the over-70s were urged to contact them. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that over-70s should use the national booking service online, call 119, or speak to their local GP surgery. Peverell Park Surgery in Plymouth said on Facebook: ""Please don't do this"". NHS Devon CCG, said if over-70s had ""not yet been contacted"" they could call the practice or wait for it to contact them. Mr Hancock urged people in England aged over 70 who have not yet got an appointment to be vaccinated to contact the NHS. ""So far we have said please wait until the NHS contacts you,"" said Mr Hancock. ""I now urge everyone aged 70 and over who hasn't yet had a vaccination to come forward and contact the NHS to book in their jab."" Peverell Park Surgery urged: ""Don't call us we'll call you."" And it added: ""Please ignore the politicians and trust that we will be in touch as soon as we can."" It had ""less than 100 patients"" who had not yet been contacted and they would get a message for a clinic at Plymouth Pavilions on Thursday or Saturday. Analysis by Ben Woolvin, Home Affairs correspondent BBC South West  Doctors and politicians are trying to get the right balance between making sure no one waiting for a vaccine is forgotten, but also ensuring GP surgeries are not overwhelmed by calls. This is especially important in the South West, a region with an above average proportion of people over-70s.   On Monday, the Health Secretary said people over 70 who couldn't get online could speak to their local GP practice but today many GPs in Devon and Cornwall asked patients not to call. The GP leading the vaccine programme in Devon told us the only people who should call their GP are those concerned they might no longer be registered at their surgery. Of course it's not just GPs who are offering the vaccine.  Anyone in those top four priority groups waiting for a jab is able to use the national booking service to make an appointment on the NHS website or by calling 119.  That service leads to an appointment at one of the pharmacies or large vaccination centres - helping to ease the pressure on GPs. St Thomas Medical Group in Exeter also urged people not to contact the surgery and said the NHS would ""let you know when it is your turn"". Southernhay House Surgery in Exeter said: ""Please do not contact your GP unless you have been contacted."" NHS Devon CCG (Clinical Commissioning Group) said in a statement that GPs booked appointments ""depending on much vaccine they are sent"". It said some practices were ""posting helpful updates on social media or on their websites to let their patients know whether slots are available or not, so people can avoid unnecessary calls"". Professor Martin Marshall, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said ""most"" eligible people had been contacted ""so if you're over-70 and haven't been, please come forward to make an appointment"". He said this ""shouldn't apply to a huge amount of people"" and urged only the over-70s and ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" to come forward.

Lifting Covid rules will 'need 70-80% vaccinated',"By Marie-Louise Connolly & Louise CullenBBC News NI Covid-19 restrictions will not be fully lifted in Northern Ireland until 70 to 80% of people have been vaccinated, the chief medical officer has said. At present, about 22% of adults have received at least a first dose of a vaccine. Dr Michael McBride said he believed some restrictions could be in place ""into next year"". Speaking at a media briefing on Tuesday, Dr McBride said new variants mean ""it is difficult to predict"". ""It's really important that we ease restrictions gradually,"" he said. ""We need to be realistic that the current restrictions that we have in place will be in place for a significant part of this year to a greater or lesser extent and into next year as well."" Dr McBride said if the rate of case numbers keeps falling, ""we will hopefully be able to do some things this summer like we did last summer"". He explained that ""over time"" new variants such as those which have emerged in South Africa and Brazil could be detected in NI, however, he said ""they may not become the dominant strain"". The briefing heard that almost all care homes in NI and those aged over 80 have had their second vaccination. Patricia Donnelly, who heads up NI's vaccine programme said about 345,000 vaccines have been administered to date, with 317,000 of them being first doses. It has also been outlined that clinically vulnerable 16 to 18-year-olds could be vaccinated within weeks, using the Pfizer vaccine. Ms Donnelly said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is only licensed for people aged over 18.  Neither Pfizer nor AstraZeneca, however, have been approved for under-16s. She said there have been concerns about the uptake of the vaccine among 65 to 69-year-olds. Describing it as good, she highlighted it has not been as strong as the 90% response rates documented for other age groups. ""They may still come,"" she added. ""We will keep the booking line open and will be in a better position to assess that next week."" On Monday, Dr McBride said people in NI should have a high confidence in the vaccines which are being used. On Tuesday, it was reported by the Department of Health that a further 10 people had died having tested positive for Covid-19. This brings its total during the pandemic to 1,953. There have been 107,438 cases of the virus after an additional 275 cases were confirmed. The latest figures published on Tuesday show there remains 60 patients in intensive care and 579 Covid-19 inpatients. There are 90 outbreaks in care homes, a fall from 94 on Monday. The department's daily dashboard reveals hospital occupancy level is at 94%. NI's deputy chief scientific adviser, Dr Declan Bradley, said there is ""so much momentum"" and the ""epidemic is slowing down gradually"". ""But driving the epidemic with our foot on the accelerator of social contact will absolutely bring the epidemic back to reality,"" he warned.

Long vaccine queues 'should never happen again',"Opposition parties have criticised a technology issue which left people waiting in the ""freezing cold"" for their vaccination appointments. At some centres in Fife on Monday there were longer than expected queues. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised for computer software problems which the health board said caused ""significant"" overbooking of appointments. Both the Lib Dems and Greens said the issue should not have happened. The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Willie Rennie, said he received ""huge numbers"" of complaints. He said many were left waiting in the freezing cold for up to four hours when their appointments should have lasted a couple of minutes. Mr Rennie told the BBC Scotland's Coronavirus Update programme: ""I'm pleased that the first minister's apologised for this but we need to make sure that this does not happen again."" Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said NHS Fife had experienced ""very similar problems"" administering flu vaccinations last year. And, according Scottish Labour MSP Alex Rowley, an elderly woman was believed to have collapsed due to suspected hypothermia while queuing in the cold in Lochgelly. Asked about the issue during her daily Covid briefing Ms Sturgeon said: ""I'm really sorry about what happened in Fife, (NHS) Fife are really sorry - it shouldn't happen."" Ms Sturgeon said she understood patients would feel ""annoyed"", but urged people to ""just bear in mind how hard health boards are working right now to get this programme delivered as quickly as possible"". Later on Tuesday, NHS Fife issued a statement explaining the issue was caused by ""significantly greater numbers"" of appointments being made through the national scheduling tool than it had ""capacity to manage"". It said: ""Those individuals who understandably could not wait in these queues are in the process of being rebooked into clinics as soon as we can safely do so."" The health board said it had increased staffing at venues and expanded clinics.  A number of appointments for Thursday through to Monday are being rescheduled - NHS Fife said people affected would receive update letters on Wednesday. NHS Fife's chief executive Carol Potter described the queues faced by mostly elderly patients as ""entirely unacceptable"". She said: ""We are determined that we will maintain the pace of the programme to ensure that our older people and those considered clinically vulnerable in Fife are vaccinated as quickly as possible. ""Again, I would like to offer a sincere thank you to the people in Fife for their continued understanding, not only this week but for many months as we have asked them to stick to public health measures. ""I also want to thank our staff for their incredible efforts. Whether it is our vaccination teams going the extra mile this week to ensure that the programme remains on our course, or our staff taking cups of tea and biscuits to those waiting in queues - there are countless examples across our wards and departments of staff going above and beyond to provide the best care possible to patients and they continue to be a credit to us.""

Barber shop fined for cutting hair in lockdown,"A barber shop has been fined after staff were caught cutting a customer's hair behind a screen. The hair stylist in West Cornwall was handed a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice for breaching lockdown regulations. Businesses such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons have been forced to close under the current national restrictions.  Councillor Rob Nolan said: ""This business clearly knew that it should not be operating during lockdown."" Mr Nolan, Cornwall Council's portfolio holder for environment and public protection, added: ""We know it is incredibly difficult for businesses at the moment but we must all do our bit to stop the spread of the virus.

Premier Inn 'investigate' lockdown party claim,"Hotel chain Premier Inn has said it is investigating an allegation that staff broke Covid-19 lockdown rules by having a party at one of its hotels.  A photo showing 10 people lined up in a restaurant area has been published in a newspaper in Wales.

'I fought off dognappers who threatened to stab me',"By Gilbert JohnBBC News A claim ""dognappers"" threatened to stab a dog owner out for a walk is being investigated by police. Former amateur boxer James Cosens said he fought off two attackers as he would not hand over his 20-week-old collie Rosie while out for a walk last Friday. The 29-year-old father and pub landlord was on Millennium Coastal Path near Llanelli in Carmarthenshire when he was threatened by two men. Dyfed Powys Police is investigating the ""extremely rare"" incident. It comes as police warn that dog theft has risen during the Covid lockdowns because prices of animals have increased - with the RSPCA saying criminals have even impersonated their officers in an attempt to steal pets. Mr Cosens said his dog Rosie ran up to the two strangers at the Morfa Berwig Nature Reserve near Bynea - and one of them picked her up and said: ""I am taking your dog. If you try to take her back I will stab you."" The former light-heavyweight amateur fighter, who moved to the area with wife Samantha and toddler Jacob last August, said he used his boxing skills to fend off the attackers. Mr Cosens said that despite the threats of the attackers, he did not see any weapons - and rescued Rosie after a ""struggle"". He posted details of the attack on social media to warn others - and Mr Cosens has contacted his local MP Nia Griffith. He is concerned as not everyone in the same situation would be able to defend themselves. ""I think they're probably more used to targeting the vulnerable - the elderly, children maybe,"" Mr Cosens said. ""But they saw a young pup and thought it's worth the risk to have a go and take her. Police said the men were described as one being in his 40s, around 6ft tall, of stocky build, and wearing light blue jeans and a dark puffer jacket and the other in his 20s, around 5ft 6in tall, and wearing similar clothing. ""We are aware that news of this incident is causing a high level of concern among dog owners in Llanelli and the surrounding area, some of whom are now fearful of walking their pets,"" said Insp Shaun Bowen of Dyfed-Powys Police. ""The incident in Bynea is at present isolated in terms of an individual being targeted while walking their dog, and we have received no further reports. ""We urge people to continue to take their usual safety measures while not reacting out of fear, but please do report any incidents or suspicious behaviour to us."" Police have warned that organised criminals are turning to dog theft amid a rise in demand for puppies during lockdown - saying 2020 was one of the ""worst ever"". ""Dog theft can be a devastating crime for families and causes considerable distress to owners,"" said Ms Blackman, of the National Police Chiefs Council. ""Whilst it is still a very rare crime, it's sadly something we have seen increasing recently. ""During the coronavirus pandemic, criminals have adjusted their activities and are taking advantage of the big demand for pets over the lockdown period. ""The cost of a puppy has considerably increased over the past year making this a lucrative market for organised criminals to exploit."" She warned pet owners to be careful posting pictures of their new puppy on social media, and for buyers to consider where the animal had come from. Some criminals are also pretending to be from animal charities in a bid to steal pets from people. ""It's really quite shocking and very worrying to hear people are impersonating RSPCA officials as a means to gain access to their beloved pets,"" said Dr Jane Tyson of the RSPCA. She reassured the public that personnel from the RSPCA will ""always wear an identity badge and a branded uniform"". Dr Tyson advised owners not to leave their dog unattended - either outside a shop or inside a car - and ensure gardens are secure. According to the Dogs Trust, there was a 62% year-on-year increase in the number of enquiries from people looking to adopt a rescue dog in 2020.  At the start of January, there were more than 1,000 adverts for dogs on three of the largest classified websites - a 59% year-on-year increase. The charity said it is also seeing huge increases in puppy prices, as sellers capitalise on demand.""Demand for dogs is at an all-time high,"" said Dogs Trust's chief executive Owen Sharp. In October, MPs debated two petitions, signed by almost 300,000 people, urging the government to make pet theft a specific offence - and the Dogs Trust has called for tougher sentences. ""Current sentencing does very little to deter thieves and does not take into consideration how devastating it can be to have your dog taken from you,"" added Mr Sharp. ""At the very least, a community order or custodial sentence being given, rather than a fine.""

Long vaccine queues 'should never happen again',"Opposition parties have criticised a technology issue which left people waiting in the ""freezing cold"" for their vaccination appointments. At some centres in Fife on Monday there were longer than expected queues. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon apologised for computer software problems which the health board said caused ""significant"" overbooking of appointments. Both the Lib Dems and Greens said the issue should not have happened. The leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, Willie Rennie, said he received ""huge numbers"" of complaints. He said many were left waiting in the freezing cold for up to four hours when their appointments should have lasted a couple of minutes. Mr Rennie told the BBC Scotland's Coronavirus Update programme: ""I'm pleased that the first minister's apologised for this but we need to make sure that this does not happen again."" Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer said NHS Fife had experienced ""very similar problems"" administering flu vaccinations last year. And, according Scottish Labour MSP Alex Rowley, an elderly woman was believed to have collapsed due to suspected hypothermia while queuing in the cold in Lochgelly. Asked about the issue during her daily Covid briefing Ms Sturgeon said: ""I'm really sorry about what happened in Fife, (NHS) Fife are really sorry - it shouldn't happen."" Ms Sturgeon said she understood patients would feel ""annoyed"", but urged people to ""just bear in mind how hard health boards are working right now to get this programme delivered as quickly as possible"". Later on Tuesday, NHS Fife issued a statement explaining the issue was caused by ""significantly greater numbers"" of appointments being made through the national scheduling tool than it had ""capacity to manage"". It said: ""Those individuals who understandably could not wait in these queues are in the process of being rebooked into clinics as soon as we can safely do so."" The health board said it had increased staffing at venues and expanded clinics.  A number of appointments for Thursday through to Monday are being rescheduled - NHS Fife said people affected would receive update letters on Wednesday. NHS Fife's chief executive Carol Potter described the queues faced by mostly elderly patients as ""entirely unacceptable"". She said: ""We are determined that we will maintain the pace of the programme to ensure that our older people and those considered clinically vulnerable in Fife are vaccinated as quickly as possible. ""Again, I would like to offer a sincere thank you to the people in Fife for their continued understanding, not only this week but for many months as we have asked them to stick to public health measures. ""I also want to thank our staff for their incredible efforts. Whether it is our vaccination teams going the extra mile this week to ensure that the programme remains on our course, or our staff taking cups of tea and biscuits to those waiting in queues - there are countless examples across our wards and departments of staff going above and beyond to provide the best care possible to patients and they continue to be a credit to us.""

Barber shop fined for cutting hair in lockdown,"A barber shop has been fined after staff were caught cutting a customer's hair behind a screen. The hair stylist in West Cornwall was handed a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice for breaching lockdown regulations. Businesses such as hairdressers, barbers and beauty salons have been forced to close under the current national restrictions.  Councillor Rob Nolan said: ""This business clearly knew that it should not be operating during lockdown."" Mr Nolan, Cornwall Council's portfolio holder for environment and public protection, added: ""We know it is incredibly difficult for businesses at the moment but we must all do our bit to stop the spread of the virus.   ""We will not hesitate to take action against those who ignore the rules and put communities at risk.""

Six men fined over illegal Halloween rave,"Six men who attended an illegal Halloween rave have been fined a combined total of more than Â£3,000. Up to 700 people are thought to have attended the rave on an industrial estate in Yate, near Bristol, lasting for more than 13 hours on 31 October. At the time the country was in a Covid tier system and gatherings of more than six people were banned. District Judge Lynne Matthews described their actions as ""selfish"", and said they risked spreading coronavirus.   Bristol Magistrates Court heard how one of the defendants, Josh Samson, had shouted expletives at a police officer who was holding a baton and goaded the officer to hit him.   The court was also told another defendant, Oliver Eavis, was seen lunging towards an officer and that police had claimed another man, George Parsons, had kicked and punched police shields.   Parsons' defence barrister said while he admitted the charge of failing to leave the site, he did not accept that he had used any violence.   Judge Matthews said: ""You decided your desire for a bit of a drink and a bit of a dance was more important than the desire to protect lives.  ""There was a risk if you didn't have the virus you might have picked it up. There was a risk you might have spread it to others.  ""You perhaps wanted a taste of freedom. Everybody is tired of lockdown and would like life to return to some form of normality. ""Your actions may have contributed to a prolonged lockdown. Your desire for freedom risked others losing theirs. It was just a risk you were all prepared to take for your own brief selfish gratification.""

Covid lab leak in China 'extremely unlikely' - WHO,"International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) mission, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus spread from a lab leak in the city of Wuhan. He said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. The investigation could now focus on South East Asia, one expert said.  The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission.  Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, is the first place in the world that the virus was detected in 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Dr Embarek told a press conference the investigation had uncovered new information but had not dramatically changed the picture of the outbreak. Experts believe the virus is likely to have originated in animals before spreading to humans, but they are not sure how. Dr Embarek said work to identify the origins of Covid-19 pointed to a ""natural reservoir"" in bats, but it was unlikely that this happened in Wuhan. He said identifying the animal pathway remained a ""work in progress"", but that it was ""most likely"" to have crossed over to humans from an intermediary species. The experts also said there was ""no indication"" that the virus was circulating in Wuhan before the first official cases were recorded there in December 2019. Liang Wannian, an expert with China's Health Commission, said Covid-19 could have been in other regions before it was detected in Wuhan. The team called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the transport and trade of frozen food.  Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia.  ""We've done a lot of work in China and if you map that back it starts to point towards the border and we know that there is very little surveillance on the other side in the whole region of South East Asia,"" he told the BBC's John Sudworth in Wuhan.  ""China is a very big place and South East Asia is a very big place. The supply chains to the Huanan seafood market were extensive, they were coming in from other countries, they were coming in from various parts of China, so to really trace that back it's going to take some work."" He added that the focus should now be on those supply chains.  The WHO mission began in January, following months of negotiations with Beijing. The experts' visit was closely-monitored by the Chinese authorities. It was unlikely that the expert group, in its politically-charged mission, would be able to pinpoint the source of the pandemic in China a year after it began. But, after visiting the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they have closed the lid on a controversial theory that coronavirus came from a lab leak or was made by scientists.  Their search for clues also included a visit to the now-famous wet market in Huanan - selling fish, meat and live wild animals - that was linked to some of the first human cases.  The team say the virus may have jumped from animals to humans, but they don't have the proof yet.  Possible carriers include bats and pangolins, but tests so far have yet to find convincing evidence for this. Another line of investigation is whether the virus could have spread through imported frozen food. The hunt for the origin will continue.  Speculation about the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. In April, US state department cables came to light suggesting that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity there. The office of the US national intelligence director said at the time that while the virus was not man-made or genetically modified, officials were investigating whether the outbreak began through contact with animals or through a laboratory accident. But Dr Embarek said a visit to the laboratory during the mission showed it was ""very unlikely"" that anything could have leaked out. He said the laboratory theory was ""not in the hypotheses that we will suggest for future studies"".

Tributes to 'full of life' Welsh ambulance worker,"Tributes have been paid to a ""full of life"" ambulance worker who has died after testing positive for Covid-19. Father-of-two Alan Haigh is the third Welsh Ambulance Service employee to have died with coronavirus. Colleagues said the married 59-year-old from Cwmduad in Carmarthenshire ""helped hundreds if not thousands of people"" during his 22 years of service. The football fan and car enthusiast died in hospital on Tuesday - just four months after becoming a grandfather. Mr Haigh is the latest ambulance service worker who has died with Covid-19 in Wales after the deaths of call handler Paul Teesdale and paramedic Gerallt Davies. He leaves behind wife Sian, sons Colin and Ryan and 17-week-old granddaughter Lucy. ""It is with profound sadness and a heavy heart that we announce the passing of Alan Haigh, a popular colleague with more than two decades of service,"" said Jason Killens, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service. ""Over the years, Alan helped hundreds if not thousands of people, many of whom would not be alive today if it were not for his skill and commitment as a clinician."" Mr Killens said colleagues knew Mr Haigh, a Manchester United football fan, as a ""full of life character who loved to chat"". He said Mr Haigh's death would be ""sorely felt"" by colleagues in the service. ""Our focus now is on supporting his family and bereaved colleagues at this difficult time,"" added Mr Killens.  ""Many of whom will be at work today and over the coming weeks continuing to provide care for those in need."" Mr Haigh, originally from Farnborough in Hampshire, joined the ambulance service in 1998 and initially worked for the non-emergency patient transport service in Ceredigion. He became an urgent care assistant in 2008 and later qualified as an emergency medical technician based in Carmarthenshire - and later Ceredigion.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-56001527,1
Hancock rejects call for Irish travel restrictions,"By Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor Health Secretary Matt Hancock has rejected a DUP call for the PSNI to restrict travel from the Republic into Northern Ireland. He was responding to a question from the DUP's Carla Lockhart.  She had raised the issue in relation to protection against new variants of the coronavirus. The Upper Bann MP also accused the Irish government of ""shameful and irresponsible"" behaviour for not sharing arrivals data with the UK. She told the House of Commons there is ""significant concern"" among people in Northern Ireland that entry into the UK could continue through Dublin. This, she said, puts people in her constituency at risk of contracting new variants of the coronavirus. ""If this continues, does he agree that the hard border currently being enforced by the Irish Republic restricting travel from north to south will also have to be enforced by the PSNI to stop entry into Northern Ireland from across the border to protect the UK?,"" she said. But the health secretary said he ""did not agree"". He added: ""I want to reassure all citizens in Northern Ireland that we are working very closely with the government in Dublin to ensure that data is shared properly and both governments have an appropriate system to safeguard our borders against the challenges we face."" Appearing earlier on BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Sinn FÃ©in TD for Donegal PÃ¡draig Mac Lochlainn said Northern Ireland and the Republic should have had a ""joined-up approach"" since the start of the pandemic.  He said this should have applied to ""travel, schools, work, opening of pubs, restaurants and so on"", and that it was not too late to implement such an approach now.  ""We have had different approaches at different times which has caused confusion, divided our people, and caused resentment,"" he said.  Mr Mac Lochlainn said he supported introducing fines being issued to individuals from the Republic travelling to Northern Ireland for non-essential purposes.  Meanwhile, the Republic of Ireland has announced it will publish legislation on quarantine hotels next week.  RTÃ reports that TÃ¡naiste (deputy prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he did not want Ireland to be seen as a backdoor to another country.  He was speaking following remarks from Health Secretary Matt Hancock that Irish and UK residents arriving in England from 33 so-called red list countries would have to quarantine in a hotel, and would be charged Â£1,750. Those who fail to quarantine in a government-sanctioned hotel face fines of up to Â£10,000 and those who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face up to 10 years in jail, Mr Hancock said. Mr Varadkar said he believed this potential jail term ""was a bit extreme"".

Soup kitchen inundated with 'desperate' families,"A charity set up to help the homeless said it has been inundated with people from all walks of life due to the ""devastating"" impact of Covid-19. Amazing Graze Soup Kitchen in Blackpool has provided 400 meals a week, as well as food parcels, during the pandemic.    Its founder Mark Butcher said it had worked to ""maximum capacity"" for months. One woman said she ""wouldn't have been able to eat and survive"" without donations from the charity. With tourist attractions forced to close during the national lockdown, Mr Butcher said Blackpool had been ""hit hard"" as so many residents rely on tourism for income. Amazing Graze, which is based in Bolton Street in South Shore, was set up in 2012 primarily to help homeless people. ""It's changed now. We're helping everybody,"" Mr Butcher said. Mr Butcher said people ""from all walks of life"" were using the service including families, pensioners, people who have lost their jobs and full-time workers.  ""We're seeing devastated people in desperate need of food, begging for food literally,"" he said. ""People rely heavily on the tourism trade and our industry and our jobs are all built [around] that.  ""People are losing their jobs left, right and centre."" By Richard Smirke, BBC North West Tonight On a bitterly cold evening, a long queue is forming outside Amazing Graze Soup Kitchen. Over the next few hours, more and more people arrive to pick up food parcels, hot meals, soft drinks and pet food.  Among them are young mothers pushing prams, taxi drivers with no-one to taxi, and former bar and restaurant workers who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. Several tell me how they are struggling financially and how the latest lockdown is having a severe impact on their mental health. They fear for the future and what the next few months will bring.  At the end of the evening, all the food supplies are gone - given out to those that need them most - and Mark and his team of volunteers get to work cleaning up, in preparation for another busy day feeding Blackpool's most desperate families. Mr Butcher said they were at ""maximum output"" by providing 400 meals a week but cannot take on any more helpers because the volunteers are in a social bubble. His wife Abbie, who also helps to run the soup kitchen, said: ""From the very first lockdown it was horrendous. ""Now there's more desperation from families. ""A lot of families are [on] the poverty line, especially with the kids being off school."" A sales assistant who has donated Â£60 worth of food to the charity said she had struggled previously but has worked through the pandemic.  ""So money I save I like to donate to help other people,"" Chloe told the BBC.  Another woman, who asked not to be named, said: ""I've been coming for quite a long time, it has helped me through a lot of struggles. ""If it wasn't for Amazing Grace I wouldn't have been able to eat and survive."" Blackpool Council's leader Lynn Williams said they had tried to do ""everything in our power to mitigate the damage caused by restrictions to the economy and people's livelihoods, particularly the vulnerable and at risk"".  She said recent budget proposals ""prioritise both the protection and care of the vulnerable through essential services, as well as investment in regeneration projects which will be key to Blackpool's economic recovery going forward"".

Care home warned over Covid cleaning failings,"A care home failed to bolster cleaning arrangements despite two Covid outbreaks, inspectors have found. Conifer Lodge in Wigston, Leicestershire, was rated inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in September last year. Inspectors saw a resident with symptoms sitting in a communal dining area. The home said it ""has always prided itself on excellent care"" and called staff ""heroes working above and beyond the call of duty"". The visit came after a manager expressed concern to the CQC about infection control, staffing and safety. The watchdog's report said: ""Despite the service having had two previous outbreaks of Covid-19, government guidance was not followed to minimise the risk of further outbreaks. ""Procedures were not in place to, where possible, socially distance people in the service. ""One person displaying Covid-19 symptoms was sitting with non-symptomatic people in the communal dining room. ""The provider explained social distancing measures were not considered unless a positive Covid-19 test had been confirmed. This is in direct conflict with current guidance to minimise the spread of infection. ""When we discussed this with the provider and registered managers, they told us they had not increased daily cleaning in response to Covid 19, including high touch areas such as door handles and handrails.  ""This meant cleaning arrangements were not sufficient to reduce potential risk of the spread of infection."" Staffing levels were also a concern, with one relative telling the CQC: ""There is a lack of staff to monitor people. My [family member] was involved in an incident where another resident inappropriately 'touched them'. ""I wasn't made aware at the time which I was annoyed about. I don't blame the staff as there isn't enough of them to watch what's going on."" Records showed one resident had been given a double dose of blood-thinning medication in error, while inspectors also found people had sustained serious injuries.  The CQC report said although one manager had identified at least eight staff vacancies, there were no plans to fill them. ""The provider and registered managers did not act on previous failings,"" the CQC concluded. ""There were no plans in place at the time of the inspection to demonstrate the importance of addressing the shortfalls in the service to bring about the improvements identified."" Chris Kemp, from Conifer Lodge, said they had taken all precautions, but that there was ""limited guidance"" available when there was an outbreak at the home in April.

'Used' Covid-19 test kits delivered to family,"A father says it's a ""disgrace"" that coronavirus testing kits, that apparently had been used, were delivered to his home. Community testing is being carried out in Walsall, following the discovery of the South African variant of the virus. Andy Witton claimed two out of five tests delivered to his home appeared to have been used.   Walsall Council said ""this is the first indication anything may have not gone to plan"". Last week, residents in the WS2 postcode area were urged to get tested. Mr Witton said his partner, Tracy Patel, opened the first one on Monday. He added: ""Because it was sealed, we thought well obviously it's sealed, open it up, because we ain't never done a test before. ""Then you had the bottle, with the swab inside... we was about to take the top off when my daughter come in and she said 'dad, they've been used'. ""I just think it's a disgrace, I think (an) absolute disgrace."" Latest news from the West Midlands Walsall Council said more than 3,700 tests had been distributed over seven days and their teams were working ""to strict protocols"" to ensure delivering and collecting kits was ""carried out safely"".    Volunteers were often approached in the street with people handing them completed tests and ""therefore it is possible"" two tests ""may inadvertently have been reissued"", the council said.  But it added ""all completed tests are boxed, and are sealed in two clinical plastic bags, so any risk of transmission is very low"". The council said it had now changed its procedures ""ensuring that all completed tests are now immediately handed to the support vehicle"". The community support for the team's efforts had been ""widely praised"", the council added. Elsewhere in the West Midlands region, there is testing for the South African variant in Birmingham and Worcestershire. Used coronavirus swab tests were accidentally given out to households in Birmingham, council officials said in October. The city council there said about 25 kits had been given out by mistake in Selly Oak, but the error was quickly realised and there was no evidence of cross-contamination. The first door-to-door testing in Birmingham since October started on Tuesday as part of Operation Eagle, to find cases of the South African variant, in Frankley.  The city's director of public health, Dr Justin Varney, told a council meeting the set-up was now being used as best practice for other areas. There were different sites for new and used swabs, the authority said.  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Where has the South Africa variant been found in the UK?,"Mass testing - or surge testing - is taking place across various parts of England to help stop the spread of new, more infectious strains of Covid-19. The South Africa variant and a new mutation of the Kent variant are those currently being targeted.  Over-16s who live or work in the following places are being asked to take tests for the South Africa variant, whether or not they have symptoms: Testing in the ME15 postcode area of Kent and the GU21 postcode area of Surrey has now finished. In addition, more than 10,000 tests are planned in Manchester after four cases of a new mutant strain of the Kent variant were found in two unconnected households. Testing will take place in the Fallowfield, Hulme, Moss Side and Whalley Range districts.  Positive cases across England will be analysed for evidence of the new variants. Those in the affected areas who have Covid symptoms are being asked to apply for a test in the normal way.  The South Africa strain does not appear to cause more serious illness in the vast majority of people.  However, it is believed to spread more easily and vaccines may not work as well against it.  A small study conducted in South Africa suggests the Oxford AstraZeneca jab offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease caused by the variant. The 147 cases detected in England so far come from a random sampling of between 5% and 10% of positive cases, so the true number could be far higher.  Experts think the UK or ""Kent"" strain may also be more infectious. Some research suggests it may be associated with a 30% higher risk of death. However, the evidence is not strong and the data is still uncertain.  The cases discovered in Manchester show a new mutation of the Kent variant called E484K which is  also present in the South Africa variant. Everywhere in England is currently under national lockdown, and there are no additional restrictions in place in the surge test areas.  However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons it was ""critical"" that people in targeted areas stay home as much as possible, and limit trips outside.  People are being asked to work from home if they can, and some schools have asked parents to keep children at home if possible.   Anyone who gets a positive result test must immediately self-isolate for at least 10 days. NHS Test and Trace will tell their contacts to isolate if necessary. Self-isolating means not leaving home for exercise or even to buy food, medicines or other essentials. People in England who fail to self-isolate after a positive test can be fined up to Â£10,000. Anyone on a low income who has been told to self-isolate can claim a Â£500 payment from their local authority. Several types of test have been developed but two have mainly been used. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test  The PCR test involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered PCR tests.  The lateral flow test  This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes. In a pilot scheme lateral flow tests weren't good at picking up relatively small amounts of virus, but did identify the majority of the most infectious cases. Regular lateral flow tests are offered to many NHS staff, and by other employers to their workers. Some councils are also offering them to people without symptoms.  When will lockdown rules change? Will I get paid if I self-isolate?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/explainers-54872039,1
Man jailed for quarantining at flat with friend,"A man who police had to carry out of a flat he was sharing with a friend when he should have been self-isolating alone has been jailed for breaking the Isle of Man's coronavirus laws. Justin Hughes, 48, admitted sharing accommodation with someone else after returning to the island from the UK. Under the island's current rules, returning residents are not allowed to quarantine with anyone they have not travelled with. Hughes was jailed for six weeks. The court was told he had returned to the island by ferry on 17 January and told port staff he intended to self-isolate at a flat in Parsonage Road in Ramsey. He was reported to police by border officials after another man answered the door when they visited the property to check up on him on 2 February. The court heard although Hughes had been staying in his own room, the flat was not subdivided and the pair had been sharing facilities including the bathroom. When arrested, he refused to leave the property and had to be carried outside. Hughes, who represented himself in court, said he felt he had been doing the right thing as the room had been stocked with food and he was ""more or less isolated"" from his friend. He was previously jailed in September for breaking the Covid-19 rules by visiting a doctor's surgery and refusing to leave while he should have been self-isolating, the court heard. Sentencing him, magistrates chairwoman Anita Ardern said his actions ""could have put the community at risk"". In a separate hearing at Douglas Courthouse, a 41-year-old woman was handed a suspended sentence for driving to a supermarket while drunk when she was supposed to be in self-isolation. Lisa Langley, of Bowring Road in Ramsey, admitted driving to the Co-operative store on Parliament Street on Sunday to buy tobacco and a meal deal after drinking two litres of cider. She was sentenced to three months in prison for the driving offence and one month for the Covid breach, both suspended for 18 months, and banned from driving for three years.

Anxious pupils should 'return to school gradually',"Pupils struggling with anxiety after lockdown should be allowed a gradual return to school, the government's youth mental-health ambassador says. Former Love Island contestant Dr Alex George said schools should give anxious students ""a bit of time to integrate slowly back in the classroom"". Dr George was appointed to the position by the prime minister last week.  The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said children could rely on teachers' mental-health ""expertise"". Dr George, who has worked in a London hospital accident-and-emergency department throughout the pandemic, told the BBC's Newscast podcast: ""As children are integrated back to schools, we need to be a little bit more flexible about the time of transitioning back. ""You can't just expect... someone who is very anxious to go back to school will go back to normal. ""It might be that... rather than chucking them in and exacerbating the problem, we do it gently and we gradually build up to normality."" Boris Johnson made Dr George the youth mental-health ambassador for England after the 30-year-old publicly asked to speak to the prime minister about his campaign for better mental-health provisions Mr Johnson said Dr George would help ""shape policy on improving support for young people in schools, colleges and universities"". Dr George also told the BBC children should be able to take sick days for mental health, adding if ""you've been able to take time when you needed to, you're probably more likely to not only be academically successful but take care of yourself physically as well"". National Education Union joint general secretary Dr Mary Bousted told BBC News: ""We agree with Dr Alex that the transition back to school must be managed carefully in order to support both pupil and staff well-being.   ""We also agree that schools will need much more flexibility in the weeks and months ahead. ""We must make children's mental health and well-being a priority for how we adapt and shape education in the transition back to school and for the future after the pandemic."" ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said the priority was ""children return to school as soon as that is possible"". ""Schools are very good at supporting and reassuring children who are anxious,"" he said. ""And we are sure they will bring that expertise to bear in helping children reintegrate back into school life after this latest period of lockdown restrictions."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""We know the pandemic and restrictions have had an impact on many children and young people's mental health, and that's why we are working to reopen schools as soon as possible. ""We are focusing our catch-up efforts and remote education support on those who need it most, and our guidance throughout the pandemic has included advice and support on mental health. ""For pupils returning to school, our Â£8m Wellbeing for Education Return programme is facilitating local expert support for education staff to respond to emotional and mental health pressures some children and young people may be facing."" Schools in England are not expected to reopen to all pupils before 8 March.",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/education-55996698,1
Councils warn of budget shortfall for May elections,"Councils in England don't have ""anywhere near enough"" money to organise elections this May, according to the Local Government Association.  LGA chairman James Jamieson told MPs cash-strapped councils faced ""substantially higher"" costs to make polls Covid-secure.  Ministers have announced an extra Â£31m for things like plastic screens and hand sanitiser.  The government says ""democracy should not be cancelled because of Covid"".  Local and mayoral elections in England and police and crime commissioner elections in England and Wales were given the go-ahead last week for the 6 May.  They will include some ballots that were postponed in 2020 because of the pandemic. In a break with tradition, the government has asked councils not to use schools as polling stations this year in a bid to minimise any further disruption to children's education.  Voters will also be asked to bring their own pens and pencils to polling stations. And rules on proxy voting - where people designate someone else to vote on their behalf - will also be changed to allow people who need to self-isolate to request an emergency proxy vote up until 5pm on polling day. However, ministers have decided against postal ballot-only elections ""as this could increase fraud risk and reduce choice for voters"". Instead, the government has allocated an extra Â£15m for local councils in England and Â£16m for PCC elections.  James Jamieson is concerned that this will only cover a fraction of the true costs. Giving evidence to MPs on the public administration and constitutional affairs committee, he warned that councils will need ""a level of flexibility"" because  issues vary up and down the country in terms of complexity.  He said councils will need to provide marshals outside polling stations to ensure queues are socially distanced. Extra cleaning facilities will also be needed for voting booths and personal protective equipment will need to be available, he told the committee.  ""The resources issue is really important because we're not going to be a normal election and it won't be a village hall with two polling clerks in it,"" he said.  ""What happens if somebody turns up to vote and they don't have a face mask, never mind a pencil?"" Mr Jamieson said there were a lot of issues that will require councils to have more resources on site, including larger venues and additional volunteers yet it is unclear what level the pandemic will be at in May.  The Local Government Association says it is currently doing an exercise to work out the extra cost of May's elections and will report back to the committee in the coming weeks.

London couple's Covid breach sparks sea search,"A couple who drove more than 100 miles and sparked a search ""in rough and cold"" seas have been fined for breaching lockdown rules. The incident took place off Winterton in Norfolk on Saturday after the couple had driven there from London. Concerns had been raised after their car was left unattended for four hours. The pair were found ""safe and well"" after police officers, coastguard and volunteer teams took part in the search. Police were called by the HM Coastguard at 15:30 GMT. The coastguard said its search and rescue helicopter was also involved in the operation. The woman and her partner were found safe and well at 16:45, as they ""returned to their car"" and the police then dealt with the pair. Police said the couple ""had travelled from London earlier in the day and both were given a fixed penalty notice for breaching lockdown rules"". Fines start at Â£200 for a first offence. The independent Caister Lifeboat wrote on in its Facebook page that it had launched at 16:20 ""to help HM Coastguard patrol officers search for a missing woman, off Winterton"".

How well does the Oxford vaccine work?,"People have been urged not to delay getting the Oxford vaccine, despite concerns that it might be less effective against the South Africa Covid variant.  Early findings from South Africa suggest the vaccine may need updating to be a better match for some emerging new variants of coronavirus. This could be true for other coronavirus vaccines too.  However, the government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, says the ""immediate threat"" is from the UK or Kent variant and there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccines are effective against that. The South Africa study, based on about 2,000 young people who had the vaccine, suggests the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offers limited protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the South Africa variant. There is no evidence to suggest it would not be effective at preventing more severe cases that need hospital treatment. In the UK, 147 cases of the South Africa variant have been identified and measures are being introduced to try to limit its spread. There is no sign that the South Africa variant will become dominant in the UK,  the government's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van Tam, has said. The ""immediate threat"" is from the UK or Kent variant and there is ""plenty of evidence"" the vaccine is effective against that, Prof Van Tam added. Research carried out in the UK found a single dose offered 76% effective protection for three months. The vaccine is given as two doses to provide the best protection.  UK scientists are working on new versions of the vaccine, to keep up with a virus that will inevitably keep mutating. It is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus (known as an adenovirus) from chimpanzees. It has been modified to look more like coronavirus - although it can't cause illness. Once injected, it teaches the body's immune system how to fight the real virus, should it need to. Research has shown it is highly effective. No one given the vaccine in trials developed severe Covid or needed hospital treatment. Unlike Pfizer's jab - which has to be kept at an extremely cold temperature (-70C) - the Oxford vaccine can be stored in a normal fridge. This makes it much easier to distribute. South Africa has paused roll-out while it does more investigations on vaccines and the variant dominant there.  Germany, Austria and France are using the vaccine but are only offering it to 18-64 year olds, because there is limited data on how well it protects the over-65s. AstraZeneca says its trial data suggests it works among over 65s. Earlier studies show older people, as well as younger people, appear to have an equally strong immune response to the vaccine.  The European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine in January for use in all age groups, including older adults. Large trials showed the Pfizer vaccine was 95% effective, while the figure for the Oxford one was 62%.  But directly comparing results is difficult because there are differences in the way the trials were carried out. And it's important to remember that even the lower 62% figure is a better result than the best flu jab, which is about 50% effective. No-one who received the Oxford vaccine was hospitalised or became seriously ill due to Covid. A recent study found a single dose of the Oxford vaccine offered 76% protection for three months, and this went up to 82% after the second dose. It is not yet known how long protection lasts with any of the coronavirus vaccines.  A separate study found unvaccinated people are protected after catching coronavirus for at least six months. Vaccines are likely to provide stronger protection than this. It may be that people need annual vaccinations, as happens with the flu jab. You will not be given a choice about which vaccine you get. In the UK, recommendations on which groups get the vaccine are made by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunology.

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning.  More details have emerged on the strict new quarantine rules for international arrivals that come into force in England on Monday. Travellers having to stay in quarantine hotels will be charged Â£1,750 for their stay, and if they fail to isolate there for 10 days they face fines of up to Â£10,000. The measures apply to UK and Irish residents returning from 33 red list countries. Meanwhile, all travellers arriving into Scotland from abroad by air will have to go into quarantine hotels. New, stricter travel measures are also being considered in Wales and Northern Ireland. Travellers arriving in England who lie on their passenger locator forms about visiting a red list country face a Â£10,000 fine or up to 10 years in jail. So what are the new travel rules? And why hasn't the UK closed its borders? International experts investigating the origins of Covid-19 have all but dismissed a theory that the virus came from a laboratory in China. Peter Ben Embarek, from the World Health Organization, said it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the virus leaked from a lab in the city of Wuhan. Following the conclusion of a joint WHO-China mission, he said more work was needed to identify the source of the virus. Wuhan, in China's central Hubei province, was the first place in the world the virus was detected. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Head teachers' leaders have warned against ""gimmicks"" in plans to help pupils in England catch up for lost learning in the Covid pandemic. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said speculation about longer school days and shorter holidays was ""misconceived and unhelpful"" - and it would not help to try to ""grind out more hours from tired children"". Schools Minister Nick Gibb told MPs he was ""open to all ideas"" on catching up, adding: ""We just have to leave no stone unturned."" The grocery landscape worldwide is changing ""for good"", online supermarket Ocado has said, after a year in which the global pandemic forced many people to buy online for the first time. Ocado's comments came as it reported a 35% jump in sales over the past year. Amid rocketing demand, the UK-based firm narrowed losses from Â£214.5m to Â£44m. The company said many customers were saying they were unlikely to revert to pre-crisis shopping habits. It's hard to stay positive during lockdown, particularly in the winter months.

Early voting proposed if Senedd election delayed,"By David DeansBBC News Voting in the Senedd elections could take place over two days or longer if the polls are delayed from 6 May. There are no plans to delay the election, but Senedd members are discussing a new law to allow a postponement of up to six months. The Welsh Government has now amended it to allow for early voting, which is used in the US and elsewhere. But the UK government says early voting would be unnecessary and would require additional resources. Welsh ministers say the UK government's view and coinciding elections for police and crime commissioners means it would be ""impossible"" to hold early voting on the original election date. Instead, the Welsh Government has amended the emergency legislation on an election delay, allowing it to propose extra polling days if an election is delayed and the commissioner elections are not held at the same time. Senedd members approved the change on Tuesday, ahead of a vote on the full legislation on Wednesday. Welsh ministers say the election should take place on 6 May, but argue the legislation is needed if it is not safe to hold the election at that time, because of Covid. But the UK government has not suggested that its own elections set for the date would be moved, and last week confirmed the PCC polls will go ahead as planned. It potentially means the Senedd election could be delayed but the PCC elections would continue to be held on the same day. Under the amended law, extra days for voting would need to be held in the seven days ahead of the new election date. A spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ""We strongly support measures to make voting easier, particularly given the circumstances caused by the pandemic and would have favoured putting in place early voting - as happens in many countries across the world - for the Senedd election on 6 May.  ""This proved impossible, given the fact that on current plans, the Senedd election and the PCC elections will take place on the same day and the UK government - which is responsible for the PCC elections - opposes early voting. ""The amendment would enable Welsh voters to benefit from the opportunity to cast their ballot on more than one day if the election were to be postponed and was not held concurrently with the PCC elections."" The UK government said it had confirmed that the PCC elections in Wales will go ahead on 6 May. Its delivery plan for the elections said early voting was ""unnecessary given voters can already vote early by post, and the additional resources required to staff early polling stations would make the elections harder to deliver given Covid-19 staffing pressures"". ""Local authorities are able to contact all clinically extremely vulnerable people in their areas to make them aware of the options to use a proxy or postal vote and they will be supported in their efforts by targeted communications from the Electoral Commission."" Senedd members voted the amendment into the election bill on Tuesday afternoon - 37 for, 13 against, with 1 abstention - during a series of votes on proposed changes to the bill. Julie James, presenting the amendment, said early voting would ""encourage more voters to participate, but also make the election safer by spreading footfall from one day to several"". The Welsh Conservatives voted against the idea - Conservative Senedd member Mark Isherwood said an election held over multiple days ""raises security concerns over the integrity of the election"", including over how ballot boxes would be secured. Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth said early voting could be a way of enabling people to cast their vote during the pandemic. Plaid supported the amendment, but Mr ap Iorwerth said there was a ""lot of work to be done"" on on how it would be delivered. Conservatives say they will abstain on the bill after their amendments were rejected. The Tories said the election should only be postponed if Wales is in alert level 4 - the most serious level of coronavirus restrictions.  But the proposal was voted down, as was an attempt to stop the election being delayed beyond 9 September. Final votes on the legislation will be held on Wednesday, which would also enable a delay to the dissolution of the Welsh Parliament - the date at which the institution formally breaks up. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, said: ""Barring any dramatic change in circumstances, I have every confidence that election officials across Wales will also be able to carry out a safe and secure Senedd election, learning from the vast number of elections that have taken place around the globe during the pandemic. ""The Welsh Labour Government should now focus all energy on ensuring the people of Wales are able to have their say on the future of our country on 6 May."" A Plaid Cymru spokeswoman said ""urgent clarity"" was needed on what is ""legally permitted in terms of campaigning activity against each alert level"". She also called for the publication of ""pre-dissolution and dissolution period guidance with the requirement for any postponement proposal to be initiated by the first minister by 7 April at the latest"".

Weekly Covid death figures show another fall,"There were 361 deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales in the latest weekly figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is 86 fewer than last week - and the second successive fall - but Covid still accounts for 37.1% of all deaths. It takes the total number of deaths, as measured by the ONS, in the pandemic in Wales to 6,843. Betsi Cadwaladr - with 73 deaths - experienced its second worst week of the pandemic. They included 42 deaths in north Wales hospitals and 29 in care homes, in the week ending 29 January. Nearly two thirds of these were in north-east Wales, which has been the hotpot for Covid in Wales in recent weeks. There were 13 deaths in hospital involving Flintshire residents and 12 in Wrexham, which also had 12 deaths involving care home residents.  There were also 66 deaths in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, including 23 hospital deaths in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and 14 in Bridgend.  There were also 27 hospital deaths in Cardiff, while Carmarthenshire had 18 care home deaths and 17 in hospital. It was still the sixth highest weekly total of deaths involving Covid, although it has fallen back from numbers seen in mid-January. Up to and registered by 29 January, the total is 6,691 people. When deaths registered over the following few days are counted, the total is 6,843. RCT, with 821 deaths, has the largest number of Covid-19 deaths occurring in Wales, followed by Cardiff with 753 up to the latest week.  When looking at crude death rates - based on local populations - Wales has three of the highest 10 across England and Wales. RCT has 340.3 deaths per 100,000 in total so far in the pandemic, which is third highest across England and Wales.  Merthyr is fifth with 323.2. Bridgend is also in the highest 10. There were 93 deaths involving Covid in care homes in Wales.  So far during the pandemic, 6,694 deaths (15.9%) mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate. With deaths occurring up to 29 January but counting registrations in the week or so after, the total is 6,843. So-called excess deaths, which compare all registered deaths with previous years, continue to be above the five-year average. Looking at the number of deaths we would normally expect to see at this point in the year is seen as a useful measure of how the pandemic is progressing. In Wales, the number of deaths from all causes fell again from 1,077 to 974, but it was still 172 deaths (21.4%) above the five-year average. The highest proportion of excess deaths was 98.8% in London. The number of deaths, as reported daily by Public Health Wales, passed the 5,000 mark on Monday. But this only records deaths which have a confirmed Covid-19 diagnosis, backed up by a laboratory test, and mostly involve hospital deaths. ONS takes a little longer to report deaths because it collates details of death registrations, in which doctors mention Covid when it is suspected or confirmed as a cause of death. In around 90% of cases, it is the underlying cause of death. This also covers deaths in all settings, from hospitals to hospices, care homes and people's homes and is regarded as giving a fuller picture. The worst days in the pandemic have been during the second wave. Under the Public Health Wales measure, it was 57 deaths on 1 January, when there were 63 registered Covid deaths in total.

'Hope but no complacency' after valleys Covid drop,"By Rachel FlintBBC News Just before Christmas Merthyr Tydfil held the title no-one wants, when the county topped the highest case rate table for Covid-19 in the UK. Just weeks on though, the picture here and across the south Wales valleys is considerably different with infection rates now among the UK's lowest. And as the vaccine rollout continues there is a small but growing feeling of hope in this tight-knit area. Health officials are warning that while the turnaround is good news, with new variants in Wales it is important people do not drop their guard. Public Health Wales said Covid case numbers had ""reduced substantially"" and thanked the public for their efforts. ""With the UK variant circulating throughout Wales being up to 70% more transmissible then it's vitally important that everyone continues to stay vigilant, to avoid rates going back up again,"" a spokeswoman said. According to the most recent data (up to 29 January), 195 people have died with Covid-19 in Merthyr Tydfil, while it has the fifth highest rate for its population, across England and Wales.  In the autumn outbreaks confirmed at hospitals, with 53 people dying after 222 cases were linked to Prince Charles Hospital and the community became the first in Wales to have mass-testing as case numbers rose. On 5 November, Merthyr Tydfil was thrust into the UK spotlight with its case rates. The county recorded 741 cases per 100,000 people during a seven day period. Cases in neighbouring Rhondda Cynon Taf and Blaenau Gwent were also very high. This was shortly before the end of a ""firebreak"" lockdown and there were fears that with people in Merthyr already having been under local restriction for weeks, cases would rise further as people were able to travel and mix again. Case rates continued to climb until they peaked at 1,349 on 18 December, the day Wales was placed under a national lockdown. Fast forward just weeks and the county recorded one of the lowest case rates - 72.9 cases per 100,000 of the population - according to stats published last Wednesday. In recent days this has begun to creep back, with the rate standing at 116 on Tuesday, but it remains in the lowest 60 areas for Covid in the UK. While weekly case rates are comparably low, numbers of people dying in Merthyr with Covid-19 on their death certificate, on a weekly basis, have increased since the start of the national lockdown in December. After going into Prince Charles Hospital for an injury in January and speaking to staff about the sheer amount of Covid patients they were seeing, Thomas Llewellyn decided to act. The artist, from Pant, took up his spray can and painted a colourful mural urging people to wear masks and help the NHS, right outside the vaccine centre. ""You could just tell they were overwhelmed. Even though I can't really do anything with a painting, but if I can get a message out to people, I feel like I've done something,"" he said. The father-of-two, known as Tee2Sugars, creates images of NHS workers and ""town heroes"" across the valleys. They illustrate the drive to change a reputation created by a ""small few"" about people living in these tight-knit areas. In the last weekend of February, South Wales Police were called to reports of a number of house parties in the county - which are banned under Covid law. Mr Llewellyn said most people were trying very hard to obey rules but in some supermarkets it was a ""free for all"" with people leaning over each other to get items. ""I think everybody just wants to get to the other end now... but there's the few that are ruining it. ""A lot of people have lost a lot of close family... I just wanted to get a positive image out there to show a little bit of hope that we can get to the other side."" While it is not yet clear exactly how case rates have fallen in the area Merthyr, like the rest of Wales, has now been under strict level-four rules for seven weeks. Health and council officials had blamed the high case rate in valleys communities on their tight-knit nature, with people living close to extended family and popping round to check on neighbours. In an area with high rates of deprivation, there were also concerns about people having to make tough choices between going to work to get a pay cheque and isolating if contacted by tracers. Member of the Senedd Dawn Bowden, said she believed cases were now falling because this lockdown had been longer and stricter while more people seemed to be sticking to the rules as the vaccine rolled out. ""We are still seeing some breaches of regulations, but we have also seen greater levels of mitigation measures required in shops and workplaces and greater levels of enforcement,"" she said. ""People I speak to are weary of the restrictions, but largely understand and support the need for them to both contain the spread of the virus and to ensure that the NHS isn't overwhelmed."" At Twyn Community Hub, there are hopes that with the falling case numbers and people being vaccinated, people will soon be able to meet outside, exercise and spend time together. Since the start of the pandemic the organisation has provided hundreds of food parcels and hot meals to those shielding and people struggling financially. While there was a feeling of hope, she said many were struggling with home schooling while still trying to work and the hub had seen an increase in mental health referrals. There is also concern families and elderly people in the area may be struggling but not asking for help, as people were proud. ""We do feel like we've been locked down for a long time... there's massive frustration,"" she said. ""Everyone is trying to do their part, but everyone has had a gut full of it now."" Since the start of the pandemic more than 6,288 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in Merthyr Tydfil, with people losing their jobs, falling ill, and losing loved ones due to the virus. Almost 63,000 people have had their first dose of the vaccine since the roll out began in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board area. O.P. Chocolate, one of the major employers in the area, said it was optimistic about the future because of the vaccine but understood it was ""likely we will need to keep taking additional precautions for several more months at least"". A spokeswoman said case numbers among staff had remained low throughout, despite outbreaks at other factories in Wales last year. ""We have learnt a great deal over the last 12 months and believe the business is stronger having successfully dealt with the crisis,"" she said.

South Africa in shock after vaccine rollout halted,"By Pumza FihlaniBBC News, Johannesburg South Africa's decision to halt its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid-19 variant may have left the nation in shock, but it also shows how scientists are at the forefront of the battle against coronavirus.  One and half million doses of the jab had been bought for healthcare workers and they were due to start getting their vaccinations this week There is no denying that they feel anxious. Siviwe Gwarube, head of health for the main opposition Democratic Alliance, said the setback left them vulnerable to a third wave. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. ""I had a lot of hope that the vaccine would change the situation we're in as a country. A lot of people are losing jobs. I'm a medical student and we are really exposed to Covid-19. It was a blow for me when I heard that the efficacy of the vaccine was lower,"" a young male medic, who asked to remain anonymous, told the BBC. But health experts say while the new variant has affected South Africa's initial vaccine plan, all is not lost - and 100,000 older nurses and other health workers will still be given the  Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as part of a new trial. This is because they believe that the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way to  reducing the number of people who need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.  This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals, which are currently overstretched.  No, say South African experts. ""We are experiencing science in real time,"" says Dr Kerrin Begg, a public medicine specialist at the University of Cape Town. And South Africa's health officials have been commended for following the advice of scientists in their handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Many of their, at times, controversial decisions have been driven by erring on the side of caution. In this case, the most recent phase of the study on the AstraZeneca vaccine was carried out on 2,000 people whose average age was 31. Recent data from the trial shows it was not effective against mild and moderate symptoms of the more contagious South African variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351. This is a stumbling block as 90% of new infections in South Africa are of the new variant. The scientists now want to see if the study on the group of 100,000 nurses and other healthcare workers will show if the vaccine is effective against the new variant and in preventing severe illness in an older age group And Dr Begg says the public should not lose sight of how much has been achieved by scientists not just in South Africa but globally since the virus's outbreak last year.  ""Vaccines usually take years to develop because they are amongst the most regulated substances on Earth. But we're in a position now where many have been passed for safety and are becoming available to the public, that is an incredible achievement."" South Africans generally do not have a problem with vaccinations - from birth, children are immunised for various diseases including polio, measles and chicken pox and hepatitis B up until they begin school. These programmes are done through both private and state hospitals. However, in the case of coronavirus, there have been some who have voiced concerns about the speed at which the vaccines have been made available, partly down to fake news peddled on social media and conspiracy theories accusing pharmaceuticals of trying to ""poison"" people through the vaccines.  Even some of those working on the frontline have doubts, including this male health worker in Johannesburg, who asked not to be named: ""I am worried that they want to test these vaccines on us healthcare workers.  ""We work in medicine, it's a concern to me that we don't know all the side-effects of these vaccines and their contra-indications but we're expected to just take them and don't have a say."" Yet most are confident in the science as expressed by a medic working on paediatric wards in a Johannesburg hospital: ""If there was a vaccine we could use I would feel more protected, less anxious, feel that there's hope.  ""Vaccines have been helping us for ages in South Africa, I would take any vaccine that's proven to be safe and effective.""  Another Johannesburg resident agreed: ""We lost family members because of Covid.  ""We need to get vaccines that work so we can get on with our lives,"" she said.  There are suggestions that if this nurses' trial goes well, AstraZeneca will still be administered to all health workers and to be followed with a ""booster"" once it becomes available.  The country's new plan, according to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, includes the new Johnson & Johnson single-dose vaccine - of which it has ordered nine million doses Trials of that vaccine have shown a high degree of efficacy against Covid-19, including the new variant discovered in South Africa in November and since confirmed in at least 30 other countries worldwide.  The government has also secured 20 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Both expected to arrive in the next few months.  Officials say they are now working on accelerating their delivery.  South Africa has recently passed the peak of a second wave of infections.  But scientists warn of another surge in the winter months, around June, so officials are imploring citizens not to drop their guard.  ""Vaccines are not going to stop Covid. Human behaviour is still one of the most important tools,"" says Dr Begg. ""People need to understand that the first defence is washing hands, keep wearing masks, practice social distance and limiting being in large crowds."" And as Prof Shabir Madhi, who led the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine trial in South Africa, has warned - mutations are always going to be a problem. The message is ""it is not too late"" to change your behaviour to beat the virus. South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk?

How to save money working from home this winter,"By Rick KelseyNewsbeat reporter The heating is on and it's 11am on a weekday. The slow cooker is making lunch and the laptop is uploading some audio for our radio programme. In the background This Morning is on TV silently (research and comparison purposes obviously). This is my house - but a common and definitely energy-sapping picture in the middle of winter. The last year has seen millions of us start to work from home. And whether that suits you down to the ground, or you're suffering from cabin fever, we're all spending more on gas, electricity and supplies. The average energy bill last year was Â£1,254, according to the regulator Ofgem - that's almost Â£3.50 a day. The thing is, that's based on our old habits; commuting, a two-day weekend at home, so a few hours of heating here and there.  Some energy experts reckon home working could easily double those numbers this year.  So here are some ways you can save money, with the help of Laura Ann Moore - a money and mindset coach. There are two ways of doing this. Your employer can pay you it as an extra tax-free amount, if you work from home as they have an agreement with the government. But not all employers offer it, especially if they are struggling.  ""People think it's only six pounds [a week] but it adds up,"" says Laura. The second and simplest way to claim back cash though is through your tax - by paying less of it. To make things easy you can now sign up directly here. This way might not be as generous, but means you don't pay tax on an extra Â£6 a week of what you earn. This is a saving of Â£62.40 a year for basic rate taxpayers and Â£124.80 for higher rate taxpayers. You don't need receipts. Now we are all spending time in one place a budget can become a game-changer even if it's just to match what goes in with what comes out. ""One of the things I've been telling people to do is unsubscribe from marketing emails,"" Laura says. She has multiple clients she's worked with since March who have let ""boredom spending"" become problematic. ""It's the instant gratification. If you feel like you can't trust yourself, take your credit card details off your phone."" The concept here is that your gas and electricity switches to a new supplier when a better deal pops up - without you doing anything. The auto-switch market has just gained a big new player - Martin Lewis - and this could mean more competition, but we could also see more deals with early release fees. They are normally only about Â£30 per fuel and it may mean a switch is not worth it. But if you are at home all the time and like it hot, auto-switching may be the route for you - if you can cope with the loss of control. It's not the only way you can save money when you auto-switch energy, according to Laura Ann Moore. ""You can get cashback - stuff that can stay in the bills pot [when you switch]."" She points out that we will all be using more water too, now many people have meters charging for how much we use. It might be worth looking at the bigger picture. As it looks like we are all in this for the long run, you could change the lights bulbs - all of them - to LEDs. They use 90% less energy than traditional bulbs and can sometimes pay for themselves through energy savings in just a couple of months. It might cost a fair whack to change twenty bulbs in one go, but by April when you still have the lights on during a wet dull day, you'll be laughing. For many of us, going out of the house less frequently, whether to work or out for a drink, means saving smaller amounts - and these can add up. ""Actively make a decision to save this money,"" says Laura.  She points out with unemployment rising we all need to be saving more if we can - and home working savings are the best way to form that kick-start. It's a big total, but three months wages is often talked about as a good figure. Laura says: ""That's what most people are realising now, that they don't have an emergency fund.""

Residents tell of fear amid Covid variant testing,"People living in part of Manchester where a new variant of coronavirus has been detected have spoken of their fears as surge testing gets under way. More than 10,000 tests are planned after cases of the E484K mutation of the Kent variant of Covid were found in two unconnected households. House-to-house testing will take place and extra test centres have been opened. Community leaders said some people were ""frightened"". Charles Kwaku-Odoi, 42, chief officer at the Caribbean and African Health Network, said: ""Obviously there is real concern. ""When such news breaks out it is not unusual that people are concerned. We will be reassuring people."" He said health professionals could help by reassuring people about the steps they could take to limit the spread of the virus. House-to-house testing is taking place in the Fallowfield, Hulme, Moss Side and Whalley Range districts. Father-of-one Lloyd Brown, 48, who lives in Moss Side, said: ""People are worried and a bit fearful over what might happen and where this could lead. We just want all this to end."" Gary Wilson, 51, who lives in Whalley Range, said: ""It's the last thing anyone wants.""  Manchester City Council has urged residents to get tested and said while the variant is more transmissible there is no reason to be concerned it is any more severe than others. The authority said those people without symptoms could get tested at Our Lady's Presbytery on Raby Street or Guru Nanak Dev Ji Gurdwara on Monton Street.  Manchester's director of public health, David Regan, said the Islamic Cultural Centre On Bedwell Street would also become a testing site on Wednesday, followed by Moss Side Leisure Centre on Thursday. He said the council would also be doing targeted door-knocking to deliver testing kits to vulnerable households, schools and businesses. ""It's a mass case-finding exercise [as] the government is really keen that we keep a step ahead of this virus,"" he said. ""It will mutate, but vaccines are still effective and we are still encouraging the public to get their vaccine, even in the affected zone."" Labour's Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell also urged ""anxious and worried"" residents to get tested. ""There will be lots of local testing sites and door-to-door knockings will be happening so people can get a test on their doorstep,"" she said.

"Extend £20 benefit top-up for a year, say MPs","The Â£20 weekly increase in Universal Credit must be extended for at least a year to avoid impoverishing hundreds of thousands of people, MPs have warned. The measure, which has been called a lifeline for struggling families, is in place until the end of March. The Commons Work and Pensions Committee said keeping the higher rate until April 2022 must be the ""bare minimum"".  The government has signalled it is looking at a range of options for support ahead of next month's Budget. Speaking in the Commons, Work and Pensions Minister Will Quince criticised what he described as ""unhelpful scaremongering"", saying discussions ""remained ongoing"" with the Treasury. He said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had a ""proven record of stepping up to protect the poorest, the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our country throughout this pandemic and I have no doubt he will continue to do so"".  About six million families have benefited from the top-up, worth more than Â£1,000 a year, since it was introduced at the start of the pandemic.  The cross-party group of MPs said a decision was needed now on extending it and warned against it being replaced by a one-off payment. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey confirmed recently that a single payment was one of the options under consideration but was not one of her department's ""preferred approaches"". In its report, the committee said that removing the top-up in April would force hundreds of thousands of families below the breadline and drag those already in poverty ""down into destitution"". The MPs acknowledged that keeping the top-up would come at a substantial cost, with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimating it could cost about Â£6.4bn in 2021-2022. But the committee said the actual amount could be much lower if government plans to support people back to work were successful in reducing the number of people who depend on the welfare system. ""Removing the extra payment in March would represent a failure by government - failure to recognise the reality of people struggling,"" said Stephen Timms, the Labour MP who chairs the committee.  ""Without regular support, hundreds of thousands of families will be swept into poverty or even destitution. government must end the uncertainty and commit to extending this lifeline."" The MPs said charities and anti-poverty campaigners were alarmed by the possibility of it being replaced by a larger single payment - potentially of up to Â£500 - believing it could destabilise people's budgets, push some claimants over the threshold for other support and increase the risks of fraud.  Given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic and its economic impact, they said a regular, steady stream of money would be far more beneficial. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation said removing the Â£20 would be a ""terrible mistake"" at a time of rising unemployment and those claiming legacy benefits, who have not yet moved to Universal Credit, should be eligible. Universal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits. You can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work.  The standard allowance varies from around Â£340 to just under Â£600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single.  You may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. ",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-55989791,1
Government's Covid help 'skewed towards men' - MPs,"Government policies have ""repeatedly skewed towards men"", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chair Caroline Nokes said the government had ""repeatedly failed to consider"" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women.  The report makes 20 recommendations including making it easier for staff to get flexible working arrangements. The government said it had spent over Â£200bn on job support schemes.  ""Throughout the pandemic this government has done whatever it takes to protect lives and livelihoods, and will continue to do so,"" a spokesperson said. Sharon Luca from Warwickshire works from home, running a clothing business and a charity raising money to help parents of stillborn children.  Her husband also works full time and so cannot help with homeschooling.  Because she is helping her son do school work, Sharon says she has ""barely had anytime to focus on my business or the charity"". This has meant losing ""a big chunk"" of her earnings she says, adding: ""My income is my only independence."" Sharon thinks women are bearing the brunt of homeschooling. ""I know a lot of mums who work from home or have small businesses like myself and all of them are saying that they've been affected by homeschooling.  ""They really don't have the time now to put in the energy to earn a living from their small business - homeschooling overtook everything."" Clare Jeffries, a single mother from Banbury, was made redundant from her job in HR during the pandemic and now can't find a role that's flexible enough to accommodate childcare  - despite lots of searching.   She worries this is a problem that largely impacts on those with caring responsibility and ""disproportionately affects women"". She says ""inclusion is a choice"" and that employers ""need to think about the choices they're making"".   ""Things like flexible working need to be a right for everybody."" She also wants the government to fund more childcare ""so that we can actually get back into work easier"". The Women and Equalities Committee has examined some of these problems and says the government needs to ""start actively analysing and assessing the equality impact of every policy"". Its chair Ms Nokes said: ""Government policies have repeatedly skewed towards men - and it keeps happening."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, she said although ministers had not ""deliberately designed policies to be sexist,"" there had been ""institutional thoughtlessness"" about their particular impact on women.  The Conservative MP - who lost her job as immigration minister when Boris Johnson entered Downing Street - also said the opinions of female cabinet ministers were ""not being played into debates and decisions"". She told the programme there was a ""very blokey mentality at the top"" of government, which had suffered from ""the predominance of single-sex education round the cabinet table"". The report notes that during the pandemic, women spent more time on caring duties than men, yet ""furlough was not clearly articulated as a right for those with caring responsibilities"".    On sick pay, the report cites evidence that women were less likely to qualify for statutory sick pay, in part due to caring responsibilities, which meant their wages were too low to be eligible for the support,  Making over 20 recommendations, the committee said the government should:   The MPs also urged the Women and Equalities Minister Liz Truss to be ""much more ambitious"" in getting other government departments to consider inequality when designing policies.  Responding to the report, Labour's shadow women and equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, called for a ""gendered response to the crisis"". She added: ""The unequal impact of coronavirus on women is huge - women are more likely to work in low-paid sectors, to work in sectors which are currently shutdown such as retail and hospitality, and have taken on more caring responsibilities.  ""The government cannot continue to deny and dismiss the reality of gender inequality across society."" Joeli Brearley, CEO and founder of the campaign group Pregnant Then Screwed, said ""policy decisions have repeatedly ignored the specific needs of women"", adding: ""We are currently witnessing a generational roll back in maternal employment that will take us decades to repair."" British Chambers of Commerce co-executive director Claire Walker said that a national focus was needed to help parents and carers.  ""Employers value the skills women bring to the workplace and the evidence shows that businesses with a diverse and inclusive workforce perform better.""  She added: ""Economic growth will depend on access to high quality, affordable childcare."" A government spokesperson said it had spent over Â£200bn on schemes ""safeguarding people's jobs"" including the Self Employment Income Scheme helping the 1.7 million self-employed women in the UK. ""Covid-19 is prompting a culture shift with more people than ever before working flexibly, and the government wants to harness that as we recover.  ""By doing so, we could see more equal sharing of care work by parents, and more flexibility from employers, enabling us to unleash the potential of everyone across the country.""

What is the government doing about the South Africa strain?,"By Reality Check teamBBC News The health authorities in South Africa announced on 18 December that a new variant of Covid 19 had been identified and was driving a second wave of infections in the country. The strain - called B.1.351 - carries one of the same mutations as the variant first seen in Kent, which makes it easier to spread. On 23 December, the government announced that it had detected two cases of the South African strain in the UK.  On 8 February, it said this number had grown to 147 cases.  On 24 December, a travel ban was imposed on South Africa. On 9 January, this was extended to nine other southern African countries. UK residents and Irish nationals were exempted from this ban but were required to self-isolate for 10 days at home. They were allowed to use public transport to travel from the airport to their home or place of quarantine. We asked the government how many people had come to the UK from South Africa - via third countries - since 24 December. We were told it does not publish this information. The Office for National Statistics does not collect figures for indirect flights either. Some countries, such as the US, have also banned entry to non-residents who have been in South Africa recently, while several others such as Australia have long-standing bans on almost any non-residents entering their countries. The UK government's ""red list"" of countries from which you are banned from flying to the UK has grown to over 30 and includes South America (where another strain of coronavirus has been identified). Again, there's an exemption for UK and Irish nationals. From 15 February, anyone arriving in the UK from one of the red list countries will have to quarantine in a government-allocated hotel for 10 days and take two tests, for which they will have to pay Â£1,750. Anyone arriving in the UK from a country not on the red list will still have to quarantine at home for 10 days, and will need to get tests on day two and day eight.  There will be tougher enforcement of the rules and all tests on people arriving in the UK will be sequenced to see if they have the new variants. There has been concern that some countries that have found cases of the new strain - the US and France, for example - are not on the red list. Matt Hancock told Parliament that ""we keep the red list of countries under review"".  He said the government had to make judgments about which countries to put on it, including whether the new variants were the ""dominant strain"" in a particular country and how much genomic sequencing was being carried out there to find the mutations.  Ravi Gupta, professor of microbiology at the University of Cambridge, believes an overall ban on non-residents coming to the UK would be better. ""The trouble with red lists is that we usually get the wrong countries, infected people come in by other routes and lists discourage countries trying to find new variants,"" he said. But he stressed that travel restrictions had to be a short-term strategy while encouraging manufacturers to make their vaccines better able to deal with the mutations. Sage is the scientific advisory group, which helps inform the government's decisions.  On 22 December it raised ""theoretical"" concerns about the South Africa variant. At its meeting on 7 January, Sage said that cases of the new South African variant continued to be found despite the imposition of travel restrictions two weeks earlier. It added that there were two potential cases which did not seem to be linked to travel.   Then at its meeting on 21 January, Sage said: ""No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants."" It also said that banning travellers from particular areas when new variants are found won't do the trick because it takes too long to identify the variants, there are relatively few countries carrying out the genome sequencing required to identify them, and people can come in via third countries.  Mr Hancock told the Andrew Marr Show on 24 January that there were 77 known cases of the South African variant in the UK, and they had been under ""very close observation"". He added that the majority of those could be traced back to contact with South Africa. We asked the Department of Health and Social Care what ""very close observation"" involved but have not yet had a response. Normal testing does not identify which variant of the virus a patient has - that can only be done by genome sequencing, which is currently carried out on between 5% and 7% of positive cases in the UK, and takes about three weeks. That means it may have spread by the time it has been identified. It also means that there may be considerably more cases in the country that have not been detected. A study in South Africa has suggested that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases of the country's new Covid-19 variant. The South African government has suspended its rollout of the vaccine. Prof Sarah Gilbert, the lead Oxford vaccine developer, said ""we're going to need to keep a really close eye on the spread of the South African variant in the UK"" but added that vaccines would still ""offer protection against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease"". She said developers were likely to have a modified jab to combat the variant by autumn. On-the-spot doorstep tests, home testing kits and mobile testing units are being deployed in a number of areas where new variants have been found.  Adults are being encouraged to take tests whether or not they are experiencing symptoms. The areas involved include parts of Kent, Surrey, Southport and Broxbourne, as well as parts of south, west and north London.   Other areas in Worcestershire, Sefton, Bristol and South Gloucestershire have been added. Prof Lawrence Young from Warwick Medical School said he was sceptical about surge testing. ""I'm not sure how it's going to contain infection given the time frame - it's likely to have already spread once it's been found,"" he said.  On 2 February, Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast that people living in areas where the new variant had been identified should be taking even greater steps to avoid social contact. He said people should not go to the shops, if they had food in the house. But this advice was not backed up with tougher restrictions. ""We're in a national lockdown, so there is not a stronger law we can bring in place that says: 'Really stay at home',"" he told Breakfast.  While the country is in lockdown there are some aspects of it that are less severe than in the first lockdown. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles are both allowed this time round and playgrounds, garden centres and estate agents are open. There is also evidence that people have been going out more, with data from the Department for Transport showing that trains, buses, the Tube in London and cars are all being used more now than during the first lockdown.

'Schools could open if rest of lockdown continues',"Reopening UK schools to all pupils in early March is feasible, as long as other lockdown measures continue, say researchers who have modelled the likely impact on infection numbers.  The London and Oxford team believes coronavirus cases could be kept in check while letting pupils have face-to-face lessons in the classroom.   The least risky scenario would be to open primaries and only exam-critical years in secondary schools.  It could keep R below 1, says the team. That would mean spread of the disease should continue to shrink, rather than grow.  The researchers did the modelling before the recent announcements from Wales and Scotland that youngest schoolchildren, aged three to seven, would likely return to school from Monday 22 February.  Many children of key workers and vulnerable pupils have continued to go to school during lockdown.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said 8 March was the earliest date schools in England could reopen, and that ""depends on lots of things going right"". Government, rather than scientists, will judge when schools should reopen, but research will help inform the decision.  Unlocking other parts of society at the same time as opening schools would be a bad idea, in the short to medium term, says the team from University College London, Oxford University and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.  If the wider lockdown were lifted in mid-April, new infections could increase sharply, they warn, based on their preliminary study, which is available online.  However, the researchers said that a rapid vaccination programme could potentially prevent this, depending on the transmission-blocking properties of the vaccines. They included the likely protective effect of vaccine rollout in their calculations, as well as the threat from the more contagious new UK 'Kent' variant of coronavirus that is spreading in the UK.  Lead author Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, said: ""Our findings suggest that reopening schools on March 8, while keeping the rest of society locked down, is a plausible alternative to continued full national lockdown and is likely to prevent the epidemic from growing again. ""Opening secondary schools appears to result in higher infection levels than opening primaries so additional strategies may be needed to mitigate this. These could include staggered re-openings as well as expansion of mass-testing at schools, and vaccination of teachers."" Co-author from UCL Prof Russell Viner, who is also president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""The UK Government has emphasised that schools should be the first area of society to fully reopen. It is therefore critical to establish how different scenarios of reopening schools might affect infection rate and deaths.""   Will children be back at school before Easter?

App brings 'hope' back to food businesses,"Independent food venues say the launch of a delivery app is giving them ""hope"" for their future after lockdown ends. The Bristol British Association of Independents (BARBI) App will take on 40 enterprises, with more waiting to join in the near future. Companies that use it will pay a 15 percent commission, which they claim is half of what some rival apps ask for. Owner of Thali CafÃ© in Easton Pepe Blanco said the small fee will help his venue ""survive"" past the pandemic. BARBI will be lowering their commission rate even further once the app is fully operational after it is launched on 12 February. Mr Blanco said: ""We wanted to choose a partnership with the bigger apps but instead it feels like we work for them and that has damaged our feelings toward the whole process. ""The income of our restaurant from apps was about 15 percent before the pandemic but now it's 90 percent so right now delivering food through apps is keeping us alive and helping us to survive. ""This new app is a breath of fresh air."" Owner of the Volunteer Tavern brewery for 10 years, Pete Gibbs, said: ""It gives me hope for my business and it's doing things that will genuinely help the hospitality sector in Bristol, that gives me a lot of faith for the future. ""Also because BARBI is charging a lower commission than the bigger ones we'll be able to sell more cheaply."" However, a Deliveroo spokeswoman said their commission rates ""are not fixed"" and are set in discussion with restaurant partners. She said: ""We have a positive track record of responding to the needs of our small restaurant partners during this challenging time and this will continue to be our absolute priority."" Co-founder of Bristol BARBI Brendan Murphy said: ""The rates that the international organisations are charging are really worrying to us so it just makes sense to do something that will help our businesses stay open.""

Welsh police 'assaulted more than English officers',"Police in Wales have been assaulted more often during the coronavirus pandemic than their colleagues in England, a survey suggests. The Police Federation found Welsh officers were more likely to have been insulted, threatened, hit or kicked. More than a third had been insulted at least once a week, a quarter were threatened and 17% were attacked. The Federation's Welsh lead said it was possible a higher rate of Covid rule enforcement had made a difference. The demand, capacity and welfare survey is carried out every two years. A total of 888 Welsh officers took part, with 35% saying they were verbally insulted at least once a week, 24% reporting verbal threats at least once a week and 17% were physically attacked without a weapon. The responses taken across seven weeks in October and November showed a higher response of six or seven percentage points than among English officers. The Federation's lead in Wales said the ""tirade of abuse and assaults"" was concerning. ""The survey was carried out while police forces were battling to enforce the Covid regulations,"" said Mark Bleasdale. ""It is possible that as Welsh forces were more stringent with enforcing rules and travel bans they were subjected to more unacceptable abuse ""While the reasoning for the higher figures is not clear, what is crystal clear and, always has been, is that abuse of any sort towards police officers, is totally unacceptable. ""These people work tirelessly to protect the public at times they are most vulnerable and they should not be subject to any form of physical or verbal assault."" The survey also found that while fewer officers in Wales (42%) took sick leave than in England (49%), a higher proportion were doing so for stress, anxiety or depression - 34% compared to 31%. A total of 70% of Welsh officers had gone to work while physically unwell and 71% had done so while mentally unwell, compared to 65% in both categories in England. Thirty per cent viewed their job as very or extremely stressful.

Why hasn't the UK closed its borders?,"By Eleanor LawrieBBC News From next week, travellers entering the UK from ""high risk"" countries will have to quarantine in a hotel in a bid to fight new, potentially more resistant coronavirus variants.  A travel ban already applies to 33 ""red list"" countries following the detection of new Covid strains in South Africa and Brazil.   But unlike other countries, the UK has never banned international travel altogether. Hotel quarantine has not yet come into force, and tougher border measures only came in relatively recently. UK arrivals must provide a recent negative Covid test and a passenger declaration form. They must quarantine at home - or at another location - for 10 days, but can use public transport to get there.  They will soon have to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining. The aim is to provide a ""further level of protection"" and help authorities track new cases from overseas, given fears the vaccine may be less effective against some of them. Direct flights from places where new variants may be circulating - such as South Africa - are already banned. Only essential travel is permitted under lockdown rules, so UK travellers who want to go abroad will soon have to declare their reason for travel. But the government hasn't issued specific guidance on what ""essential travel"" is. It says only that ""reasonable excuses"" to leave home - such as work - also apply to international travel.  ""We see plenty of 'influencers' on social media showing off about which parts of the world they are in. Going on holiday is not an exemption,"" Home Secretary Priti Patel has warned.  These tighter rules only started coming in around Christmas time and scientists believe the variants could have reached the UK earlier. There is also concern over compliance, with one survey suggesting up to a third of arrivals disobey rules to self-isolate at home. Between 27 March 2020 and to 17 January 2021, 332 fines were issued by police in England to people who did not self-isolate after returning from abroad, and three were issued in Wales.  More than 1.2 million people arrived in the UK by air in July alone. Passengers arriving from certain ""high risk"" countries will be taken to a hotel where their 10 days of isolation can be monitored. The policy was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on 27 January but will not begin until 15 February.  Scotland and Wales have suggested the plan does not go far enough.  There will be a ""managed quarantine"" for all travellers arriving in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says, with details to be announced on Tuesday. Only targeting certain countries is ""not an effective policy,"" Mark Woolhouse, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the University of Edinburgh told the BBC. Concerning variants have usually spread by the time we know about them, he says, and it's impossible to predict where the next one will come from. ""You can shut the stable door, but the horse you are concerned about has already gone, and the other one will bolt from somewhere else,"" he says.  But he questioned the practicality of a complete border closure, comments echoed by Professor Calum Semple, a member of the scientific group Sage which advises the government.  ""You can't do it altogether when you have got a country that is dependent on imports for food and other essential processes. It is just not possible,"" Prof Semple told the Today programme. The debate over whether to shut the borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus. Quarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days. An inquiry into the pandemic suggested it was understandable the government ""did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights"" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home. But these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March - 10 days before the UK went into lockdown. ""The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,"" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said.  A recent study found the virus was introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. The Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was ""incorrect in their assertions"". It said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons.  It argued that by mid-March there was ""significant transmission"" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a ""very marginal"" impact. At a meeting in February 2020, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days.  The scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required ""draconian"" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. Australia and New Zealand closed their borders to almost all visitors in March, although travellers from New Zealand can now enter most Australian states without quarantine.  This is currently a one-way agreement - meaning they must do 14 days of managed isolation on their return. And Australians are not allowed in at all, unless they have an exemption such as being in a relationship with a New Zealand resident.  Most foreign nationals are not allowed into Japan unless they are residents. Even then, they have to provide evidence of a recent negative test, get tested on arrival and then isolate for 14 days. Travellers from the UK or South Africa must spend the the first three days of isolation in a government facility and take another test on the third day.

Hospital criticised over A&E social distancing,"Inspectors say a hospital needs to urgently tackle long waiting times and a lack of social distancing in A&E.  Ambulance crews faced ""significant delays"" in handing over patients at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, according to Healthcare Inspectorate Wales. A remote quality check also found a lack of safety measures to stop people catching Covid in the A&E waiting room. Hospital bosses said they had taken steps including temperature checks and opening more cubicles.  Inspectors carried out the latest quality check at Wrexham Maelor remotely in November, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. They acknowledged that some issues raised during an earlier visitÂ in August 2019 had been addressed, with patients no longer leftÂ queuing on trolleys in corridors because of the risk of infection. However, they called for Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board to take further steps to ensure people receive care in a timely manner. They said the Welsh Ambulance Trust ""were still reporting significant delays at the hospital"". ""We were told that this year was particularly challenging due to Covid-19 and the need for patients to socially distance,"" the inspectors said. During December, Wrexham Maelor A&E was one of the worst performing in Wales, with only 53.7 per cent of the 4,146 patients who came through its doors seen within the four-hour target. Problems with Covid safety had been raised by a member of the public who took their child to A&E but ""made a decision to leave as they did not feel safe due to a lack of ability to socially distance"", the inspectors added. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it welcomed the recognition of the progress made since the 2019 inspection. Officials said they were tackling concerns about social distancing by carrying out temperature checks and increasing cubicle capacity, with measures also taken to improve waiting times by speeding up the flow of patients. Maureen Wain, hospital director at Wrexham Maelor Hospital, said they had also won Welsh Government funding for an urgent primary care centre in the outpatient department to relieve the pressure on A&E. ""We will continue to work hard to address areas highlighted in the report where further improvements could be made,"" she added.

Prison 'behind smallest county's Covid surge',"An outbreak of Covid-19 at a prison has caused England's smallest county to have the highest infection rates in the country, officials have said. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) confirmed cases at HMP Stocken in Rutland. On Monday, statistics showed the county had 199 new cases in the week up to 4 February, giving it a rate per 100,000 people of 498.4. Rutland and Melton MP Alicia Kearns said she understands ""around half"" of cases in the county were in the prison. The rate in the week up to 28 January was 162.8, with 65 new infections. The category C prison - which can hold up to 950 inmates - had been free of the virus for 11 months, according to the Prison Service. Mike Sandys, director of public health for Leicestershire County Council and Rutland, said Rutland's small population of just under 40,000 residents meant its infection rate was more susceptible to spikes. He said the outbreak at Stocken probably involved ""tens of cases"", but urged people to maintain social distancing and other preventative measures to ""stop the virus spreading"". ""It doesn't take so many cases, given the small size of Rutland's population, for that to make a really big difference to the rate,"" he said. ""There is at least some reassurance for local people - it isn't that we're seeing a massive increase in community transmission, it is contained within the prison setting."" Despite the prison outbreak Mr Sandys said infection rates in Rutland had been following a downward trend, with rates across the East Midlands ""coming down steadily"" in recent weeks. Ms Kearns, the Conservative MP for the county, said she believed ""around half of all cases"" in Rutland were in the prison. But she added the governor had her ""full support and confidence"" to get the outbreak under control. Officials confirmed mass testing for all staff and everyone housed on four of its seven wings which are affected by the virus. The MoJ has not confirmed how many positive cases have been identified at the prison, but said it is taking ""precautionary measures"" and ""will continue to closely monitor the situation"".

How many people have been contacted by test and trace?,"The number of people contacted after testing positive in England through NHS Test and Trace has now reached almost 2.7million. They include more than 172,000 who tested positive for coronavirus in the last week of January. Test and trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. Almost 5.5 million close contacts have been reached so far. Those people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they have it. Each UK nation has its own contact tracing service:  People who have tested positive for coronavirus are contacted by app, text, email or phone.  They are asked to log on to a website and give personal information, including:  Close contacts are:  Contact must have taken place within a nine-day period, starting 48 hours before symptoms appeared.  If you are approached because one of your contacts has tested positive, you must stay at home for 10 days from your last point of contact with them.  You must self-isolate, even if you don't have symptoms. Others in your household don't have to self-isolate unless they also develop symptoms, but must take extra care around you regarding social distancing and hand washing. There is also an NHS Covid app for people in England in Wales, which you can download on a smartphone (but not on smart watches or tablets).  To get started, go to Android's Google Play or Apple's App Store and search for ""NHS Covid-19"".  Phones must have:  Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own apps. The government estimates that there are currently 16.5m active users of the app. When two phones running the app are near each other, they will make contact through Bluetooth.    If they are close for a long enough time, and one of the two owners later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert.  You can also use the app to check in at venues - for instance, shops or places of worship. In total, the app has told 1.7m people to self-isolate, although some of those people may also have been reached by contact tracers.  The prime minister claimed the UK's test and trace system would be ""world-beating"". But it has encountered several problems along the way. These included:  The NHS Test and Trace's head, Baroness Harding, has claimed that the programme is now having a ""material impact"" on lowering the R number in England.

Two tests for all UK arrivals during quarantine,"All travellers entering the UK will be required to take two coronavirus tests while quarantining in an attempt to prevent variants entering the country. Arrivals will be required to get a test on days two and eight of their 10-day quarantine period, whether they are isolating at home or in a hotel. The Department of Health said the move would enable authorities to track new cases more effectively. Health Secretary Matt Hancock will set out more details in the Commons later.  It is in addition to the current rules which require travellers arriving in the UK - whether by boat, train or plane - to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. This test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling, and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500, with Border Force officials carrying out spot checks. Travellers must provide contact details and their UK address. They can then travel - by public transport if necessary - to the place where they plan to self-isolate.  The new testing policy comes amid concern about new variants entering the country that are more resistant to existing vaccines. Early trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine suggest it offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. There have been 147 cases of the variant have found in the UK. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the results were ""expected"" because the virus is ""introducing mutations... to allow it to still transmit in populations where there's some immunity."" ""As long as we have enough immunity to prevent severe disease, hospitalisations and death, then we're going to be fine in the future in the pandemic,"" he said. On Monday, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said the South African variant did not appear to have a ""transmissibility advantage"" over the one first identified in Kent, which has spread across the UK. It was therefore unlikely to ""overrun"" the Kent variant, he told Monday's coronavirus briefing.  From 15 February, UK residents and Irish nationals arriving from certain countries will have to quarantine in hotels. Passengers will have to stay in their rooms for 10 nights, with security guards accompanying if they go outside. The rules will apply to UK nationals and residents arriving from 33 ""red list"" Covid-19 hotspots - mostly in South America and Africa - where it's feared Covid variants may have already spread. Passengers will be expected to pay for the cost of the accommodation. Non-UK travellers who have been in these countries in the 10 days before travelling are banned from entry. All travellers - including British nationals - must self-isolate for 10 days when they get to the UK. The ""test to release scheme"" - where travellers from non-red list countries can leave home isolation after a negative test on day five - will remain under the new testing rules. Passengers will be expected to use the gold-standard and more expensive PCR tests. Derek Jones, chief executive of luxury travel company Kuoni, welcomed the testing plan.  ""As we have said all along, a robust testing regime is the way to open up travel again but it has to replace or at least shorten quarantine,"" he said. It comes as Prof Van-Tam warned it was too soon to say to what extent people could begin to start planning summer holidays. Speaking at Monday's coronavirus briefing, he said: ""The more elaborate your plans are for summer holidays, in terms of crossing borders, in terms of household mixing, given where we are now, I think we just have to say the more you are stepping into making guesses about the unknown at this point,"" he said. ""I can't give people a proper answer at this point because we don't yet have the data. It is just too early to say."" Lockdown rules mean people must only travel abroad for essential reasons.

NI executive 'must form loneliness strategy',"The British Red Cross is urging the executive to develop a cross-departmental strategy to tackle loneliness in Northern Ireland.  In a new report it highlights the negative impact the pandemic has had on people's mental health. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a cross-departmental loneliness strategy. The charity wants to make sure everyone has access to mental health and wider emotional support facilities.  Kenneth Watt from the Red Cross said: ""We'd like to see the executive commit to taking forward a strategy to tackle loneliness across all policy areas. ""We'd also like to see tackling loneliness fed into all aspects of the Covid-19 response as well as committing to make sure that all sorts of support - including financial and mental health support - is targeted at those most at risk."" The report 'The Longest Year: Life under local restrictions' highlights the lack of social contact with others during the pandemic and the negative effect it has on people's mental health as one of the biggest challenges associated with lockdown regulations.  Northern Ireland has been under tight lockdown restrictions since 26 December, which were extended until 5 March. to stop the spread of Covid-19.  The report has identified two groups which have been ""hardest hit by the pandemic"" - the first group are referred to as ""newly vulnerable"" - people who have never asked for mental health support before and feel they should be able to cope on their own, without additional support.  Those in the second group have identified as currently ""on the brink"", whose existing challenges have been exacerbated because of Covid, many in this group are struggling financially.  The Red Cross has called on the Executive to tackle loneliness and social isolation by integrating early action into Covid-19 recovery plans and the mental health strategy. It also wants ministers to commit to develop and implement a cross-departmental Northern Ireland loneliness strategy. Sharon Sinclair, Director for Northern Ireland at the British Red Cross said: ""Our research shows that many vulnerable people feel uncomfortable talking about their problems and that a lack of social contact is having an increasingly negative impact on people's mental health. ""With many people now finding themselves newly vulnerable and many others on the brink, we have to listen to those telling us the coronavirus crisis is leaving them feeling lonelier than ever.  ""We need immediate and long-term action.  ""Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK without a loneliness strategy and this needs to change.""

Rural victims 'may be stuck' with domestic abusers,"By Craig DugganBBC Wales news More support is needed to reach domestic abuse victims trapped in lockdown with their abusers, charities have warned. In August, Dyfed Powys Police received 900 reports of domestic abuse compared with 350 incidents a month in 2017. While reports have risen, there are fears many victims in rural areas are not seeking help. The West Wales Domestic Abuse Service (WWDAS) said many could not reach out for help while stuck at home. Chief Executive Michelle Pooley said that while the charity had seen more people referred for support, people living in tight-knit rural communities were less likely to seek help. She said she feared this had been heightened due to the stay home restrictions, with victims not seeing friends or support networks for weeks on end. ""Sometimes people are worried about coming forward because they're worried about what the neighbours will say or what friends will say,"" she said. ""[Now] people are not going to work they're not able to get out so they can't always access services and they've not been able to contact us."" Police forces in England and Wales recorded an increase in domestic abuse reports in the first few months of the initial Covid lockdown, with statistics showing 259,324 reports between March and June - 7% up on the same period in 2019. Women's Aid, who manage some refuges for women in Wales, said the coronavirus pandemic had made it harder for victims to escape their abusers. Ms Pooley said WWDAS supported up to 300 victims every month, but she feared many victims felt trapped. ""There are more situations where people are unable to get out of the place to take that breather,"" she said. ""So actually, it's feeling a bit of a shock to everyone, a sort of perfect storm if you like.""  Dyfed Powys Police and Crime Commissioner Dafydd Llywelyn said the increase in domestic abuse reports showed more victims were asking the police for help. ""Over time I hope that it will decrease and that we may be in a position where we do not need domestic abuse services,"" he said. At the Women's Institute members are being taught how to spot the signs of domestic abuse, such as unexplained bruises from physical violence and signs of coercive and controlling behaviour. Mair Stephens, Chair of the WI's Federations of Wales Committee, said the organisation was now trying to recruit men as ambassadors to speak out against domestic abuse.

Scotland exams 2021: How will grades be awarded?,"By Lucy WhyteBBC Scotland News Exams have been cancelled for the second year in a row in Scotland because of Covid. Guidance has been released for teachers on how assessments should work, although this may change. So, how will pupil grades be awarded in 2021? The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) is in charge of running exams in Scotland. Traditionally, pupils in the senior stage of secondary school would sit at least some of their National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher courses under exam conditions, on the same day, and at the same time as their peers across the country.  This year however, final grades will be decided by teacher estimates and a ""quality assurance"" procedure overseen by the SQA. In order to reach these estimates, teachers need to gather three or four pieces of work from each pupil to used as evidence of a final grade.  The SQA is advising that this evidence is, wherever possible, gathered in controlled conditions - like the conditions usually found in a class test. This might look and sound like an exam, but it doesn't have to clear that high a bar. For example there will be no external invigilators.  The work gathered by a teacher needs to demonstrate a pupil's understanding of the different aspects of a course. For example, Higher English would require a pupil provides evidence of critical essay writing, reading for understanding, analysis and evaluation as well as a Scottish text.   To establish an estimated grade, teachers will then have secure access to material from the SQA to help them formulate things like questions for tests and marking structures.  Once teachers have decided on an estimated grade, a process called ""quality assurance"" begins. It is a three stage process where initially teachers within the same school will sample and check each other's work.  Local authorities will also play a role in sampling work. SQA representatives could then provide a third layer of ""quality assurance"" by carrying out spot checks on some schools. Final estimates will be submitted to the SQA by Friday 18 June - a month later than originally planned, following the Scottish government's latest extension of lockdown to mid-February.   When the SQA have the grades, in theory, only a very small number may need to be changed if they spot anomalies or inconsistencies. In 2020, teachers also submitted grade estimates. An algorithm used a school's past performance to change some pupils' grades.  That caused a significant backlash which eventually lead to a u-turn on exam results. The SQA reverted grades to original teacher estimates.  There is no algorithm like that in place this year. There are a number of issues which could cause problems for this planned way of assessing Scotland's pupils such as the continuation of remote learning.  Most pupils have been at home since the start of the year. A small number are due back in class, in two weeks, under a phased return. This includes senior pupils who need to complete practical work, like lab experiments.  We are still waiting to find out how long this situation will last, however it is likely to involve some form of social distancing for the older pupils once they return, which could limit class numbers. In its guidance for teachers, the SQA explains pupils must be at the right stage of their subject prior to assessments taking place. It states: ""Assessment cannot be undertaken unless young people understand the foundations of their course content and have had time to consolidate their learning once they return to school."" The SQA advises against assessments while pupils are still out of classrooms and is asking for young people to be given time for more in-class learning before they start to complete work that will contribute towards a grade. However, the longer pupils are learning from home, the more time pressure there is on both pupils and teachers to provide work relevant to their eventual grade when they return.  Parents should not be surprised therefore if we see the SQA modify guidance further or for the process of ""quality assurance"" to be simplified again. An SQA spokesman said that ""maximising learning and teaching"" was the priority during remote learning. He said: ""SQA has provided schools and colleges with broad guidance on evidence gathering and estimation with a very clear focus on the quality of key critical evidence, not quantity.""       The spokesman said the ""alternative certification model"" was being supported by the SQA issuing specific guidance and assessment resources. He added that the SQA was considering what was the most appropriate process for appealing against the grades awarded.

Watching loved ones die without care in Wuhan,"Weeks after reports of a mysterious new virus began to emerge in the central Chinese province of Hubei, the authorities there suddenly changed how they determined who was infected.  It led to a significant spike in numbers - only because doctors are now counting patients who are diagnosed in a clinic and not just those who have taken the test.  But in those early days, the rapid spread of the virus through the city of Wuhan, combined with a shortage of hospital beds, meant some didn't get the treatment they needed. Two Wuhan residents told the BBC about the harrowing experience of trying to get care for their loved-ones in a city overwhelmed by sickness.  Huang was raised by his grandparents after his parents passed away when he was a child.   All he ever wanted was to provide for his grandparents, both in their 80s, so that they could enjoy retirement in bliss, he says.  But in the space of just over a fortnight, his grandfather was killed by the coronavirus, and now his grandmother is in a critical condition. Huang's grandparents started to have respiratory symptoms on 20 January. They couldn't go to a hospital until 26 January as it was difficult for them to get around after Wuhan was put into effective lockdown on 23 January, with public transport suspended. They were diagnosed with the novel coronavirus on 29 January, but were only admitted to a hospital three days later.  But the hospital was so full that there were no empty beds. His grandparents had high fever and difficulty breathing, but were only offered seats in the corridor. He begged the hospital staff and he managed to get a long chair and a folding bed.  ""There's no doctor or nurse in sight,"" Huang wrote in his diary, ""Hospital without doctors is just like a graveyard."" The night before his grandfather passed away, Huang was with his grandparents in the corridor. He kept chatting with his grandmother so that she wouldn't know that his grandfather was experiencing delirium, he says. A bed was finally available three hours before his grandfather died. Huang was by his bedside till the last minute.  He wrote on Weibo, China's Twitter-like platform: ""Grandpa, please rest in peace. There's no pain in heaven.""  ""Many patients died without the company of family members and couldn't even get a last look at each other.""  His grandmother is battling for her life in the hospital, and he spends as much time as possible with her.  ""There's no effective medicine. Doctors told me not to hold out hope, and she can only get through by herself,"" he said.  ""We can only let fate decide.""  Since 7 February Xiao Huang has himself been feeling unwell and has now been quarantined for two weeks in a hotel.  In early January, Da Chun's mother developed a fever. The family was not particularly alarmed, thinking that it was just a cold. They had heard little about the mysterious disease that was quietly spreading in the city of 11 million.   But her fever did not subside for a week, even though she received injections from a community clinic. On 20 January, the same day when Chinese authorities admitted that the coronavirus is transmittable between humans, he brought his mother to an outpatient clinic designated for people with fever. After looking at the chest scan and results of the blood test, the doctor told them that his mother had been infected with the novel coronavirus.  ""Till this day, I am still in disbelief,"" says Da Chun.  But more bad news came. The doctor said his mother, 53, could not be admitted to a hospital because they didn't have the test kits to confirm the diagnosis. The test kits were only available at eight designated hospitals in late January.  ""A doctor of a designated hospital told me they don't have the right to hospitalise my mum. It's the local health commission that allocates beds for confirmed cases,"" the 22-year-old says. ""So, doctors can't do [the] coronavirus test to confirm my mom as [an] infected case, and can't offer her a bed."" Da Chun says his mother was not an isolated case. In a chat group with more than 200 members on the popular messaging app WeChat for families of infected patients people shared similar stories.  His brother would queue up at hospitals to check if there were beds available. He would go to the clinic with his mother so that she could get drips. But during these visits, they saw patients pass away inside observation rooms before getting tested or admitted.  ""The dead bodies were wrapped and taken away by parlour staff,"" he says. ""I don't know if they will be counted as deaths [caused by the novel coronavirus]."" His mother's condition continued to worsen. She started to cough blood, and there was blood in her urine.  On 29 January, his mother was finally admitted to a hospital, but he says she received no treatment and the hospital did not have sufficient equipment during the first days when she was first hospitalised. But he's not giving up hope that his mother will recover.  Reporting by the BBC's Grace Tsoi. Illustrations by Gerry Fletcher.

Holiday giant Tui bets on summer bounce back,"Travel company Tui has said it expects to run 80% of its normal capacity for this summer, with 2.8 million customers already booked for its holidays. The statement follows optimism from other travel firms that the industry is set for recovery as coronavirus vaccination programmes advance. Despite the upbeat mood, summer bookings for 2021 are down 44% so far compared with last year, the firm said. Boss Fritz Joussen said the UK market had ""a special significance"" for Tui. ""We see an impressive pace and ambitious targets for vaccinations there."" He added: ""We should do everything we can to quickly return to basic freedoms and make travel possible again."" Average prices for holidays are 20% higher than for summer 2019. Although demand for breaks appears to be building, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said on Monday it was ""too early to say"" whether people would be able to have holidays as normal this summer. Tui's predictions for the summer season came in a trading statement that underlined the scale of the collapse in the tourism market due to Covid curbs. The firm's winter bookings fell 89% compared with a year ago, with November and December hardest hit. Income in the three months to the end of 2020 fell 87.8% year-on-year, from â¬3.86bn (Â£3.4bn) to â¬468.1m. ""With strict cost discipline and the realignment of the group, which is being driven forward at full speed, we succeeded in reducing the loss in the past quarter,"" Mr Joussen said. ""As expected, customers will book their summer holidays much later this year than in normal years. However, demand remains strong, people want to travel - this is shown by the already good number of bookings for the summer."" Tui also disclosed that it had agreed a third coronavirus financing package with banks, shareholders and the German government's Economic Stabilisation Fund, created to support companies hit by coronavirus. This raised â¬1.8bn, including â¬500m from shareholders in a rights issue, which it hopes will tide it over until conditions improve. ""The travel sector has been hammered by the global coronavirus pandemic, with revenues falling off a cliff-edge as travel restrictions have scuppered any holiday plans for consumers,"" said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""Investors will be eager to see if vaccinations can give the business the shot in the arm it desperately needs, having already secured three bailouts from the German government.  ""Regardless, Tui needs to reduce its costs and take advantage of the millions of consumers desperate to go on holiday as soon as the restrictions are eased.""

'My TikTok cancer diary',"A medical student who has been diagnosed with cancer is documenting her journey on TikTok. Eleri Reece-Jones, 21, from Rhuallt in Denbighshire, was diagnosed last month with Hodgkin's Lymphoma and is due to start chemotherapy on 18 February. She decided to share her story on the TikTok social media platform and has since been watched hundreds of thousands of times. She said the response has been ""really overwhelming"". The Cardiff University medical school student, currently completing a sports science degree at Bangor University, was initially told that the lumps she felt in her neck were because of glandular fever. ""By December, I was thinking this definitely isn't normal. And I think that was probably my medical knowledge that you're: 'I need to go and get this checked again, because I'm not happy with it'."" When she got her diagnosis she said she ""struggled"" but has tried to make it a positive experience for herself and others to share. ""I had the app and I was a long-time stalker on there... I've never really posted anything myself,"" she said. ""The response has been really overwhelming, I didn't realise how kind people are, everyone is affected by cancer or a hard time, and it's just shown a real sense of community in the comments."" The TikTok app has more than one billion users, who create and share short videos on the platform. Eleri said a big part of of starting to make the videos was to ""break the news"" to people. ""I didn't really know how to break the bad news, because it is bad news but it's your bad news. It can be really hard to tell your friends, people that you know and people that you wouldn't necessarily talk to. So I thought that by making a video, then everyone would find out and find out on their own terms."" ""Since the first video is really big - the response is really overwhelming - I just thought, well I'll carry on making them.  ""Having any kind of illness can actually be really lonely, you can feel isolated, but everyone's going through a hard time and we don't realise the difficult cards that people have been dealt. ""The comments on the videos and just seeing people's response, it makes you really realise that you're really not alone and people are just so kind. ""I think it's been people being like 'I'm in the same situation' or 'I know someone in the same situation' that's probably been really moving, or just people saying 'I'm proud of you' and I'm thinking, you're a complete stranger to me and that means so much to me, like you'll have no idea how much that's made my day."" She added that the positive tone to her videos is a ""conscious decision"". ""When I first found out I definitely was upset and struggled with it for a couple of days and I just thought everyone's going through a hard time and I've got to make this easier for myself, so I'm just going to try and be as happy as I can to find some kind of benefit in this. I've already seen so many positives."" She added she is ""just taking it a day as it comes for now"" as she prepares for treatment. One aspect Eleri wants to share online is cutting her hair and donating it to The Little Princess Trust, which she said feels like ""coming full circle"". As the charity provides wigs to people under 24 who have lost their hair to cancer, Eleri will receive one when she undergoes chemotherapy. She will be having her hair cut next week and is waiting for special permission from the council for her usual hairdresser to be allowed to do it during Covid. ""I think that probably the hardest bit about it is coming to accept that I'm gonna lose my hair. And it's taken a while for me to be like, just to think, my hair isn't my personality, it's not who I am, and the people who love me and kind to me, they're still gonna love me whether I have hair or not."" Eleri, who has found it ""very strange"" to change from the role of medical student to patient, hopes her videos can encourage others to visit their GP if they have cancer symptoms. Having already lost her grandmother to bowel cancer last year, Eleri said it has been ""a really hard time"" for her and her family. ""It's a hard time but I think we just tried to make the most out of everything and just enjoy the things that we can enjoy.""

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. People arriving in the UK must have a negative test before entering the country. After arriving, they must self-isolate for up to 10 days - and, from 15 February, people arriving from Covid hotspots must pay to isolate in hotels. Now, another layer is being added - all arrivals will be tested twice during their isolation. It's not know when the tests will take place - but it's thought it could be on the second and eighth day of isolation. The government says the tests will ""provide a further level of protection"" and ""give us even more opportunities to detect new variants"". Last night, England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam said vaccines were likely to stop serious illness caused by variants. Watch his comments below. The NHS Covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate so far - and ministers believe it has prevented 600,000 cases. Internal data shows 16.5 million people are using the contact-tracing tool. That's 24% below the number of downloads, as some people delete the app, turn off the contact tracing - or never even activate it.  Government policies have ""repeatedly skewed towards men"", a committee of MPs has said in a report on the impact of coronavirus on men and women. Committee chairwoman Caroline Nokes said the government had ""repeatedly failed to consider"" the labour market and caring inequalities faced by women. The report makes 20 recommendations - including making it easier for staff to get flexible working. Watch one woman's story below.

"'Fatigued, exhausted but still going'","By India PollockBBC Wales social affairs correspondent Social care staff are more stretched now than at any point in the pandemic, the Association of Directors of Social Services Cymru has said. President Nicola Stubbins said workers were ""exhausted"" and under ""sustained pressure"". At one point in the first lockdown, 15% of council social services staff in Wales were absent due to sickness. Ms Stubbins said directors were ""firefighting"", but the pandemic had shown how resourceful the sector was. She said the NHS would ""grind to a halt"" without the social care workforce preventing hospital admissions and supporting people to leave hospitals safely. Andrew James is a domiciliary care worker for Caerphilly council and provides care to older people in their own homes. He has type 1 diabetes and, two years ago, had a heart attack. ""I had to shield in the beginning for 12 weeks. I've come back and it's worse now than it was at the first wave, but I've got to play my part,"" he said. His colleague Hilary Evans, who has asthma, also shielded for three months. ""We couldn't stop thinking about the carers on the front line, working non-stop, and it made us feel guilty so we offered to come back,"" she said. ""We missed work and we missed our clients and had our part to play."" Seran Wady, who manages their team, said since the beginning of the pandemic, the team had provided an average of 18,459 individual care calls a month. ""Like the NHS, I think we're saving lives. We're doing a lot of work around preventing admissions to hospital for people but also by facilitating discharges from hospital.  ""We've responded really well and that's been through the dedication and the determination of the office and care staff."" Other social care workers have had to completely change how they work. Alwen Evans, a community occupational therapist in Denbighshire, used to visit people at home but only goes out in a crisis now. ""I work from my dining room table and do sessions virtually. It doesn't mean the quality of care has been affected, but it is very different,"" she said. ""Resilience is wearing thin in health and social care across the board at the moment."" There are about 72,100 jobs in the adult social care sector, which represents about 6% of total employment in Wales. About 19,637 of those are domiciliary care workers. Most care workers are on the minimum wage - Â£8.72 an hour for those aged 25 and over. In 2016, the average annual earnings for those in the adult social care sector in Wales was estimated to be Â£16,900, compared to the average of Â£29,200 for all other industries. Ms Stubbins, who is also the director of social services in Denbighshire, said: ""Social care staff are stretched now to a point I've never seen before and at this moment in time, stretched far more than any point during this entire pandemic.  ""They are exhausted, but they keep going.  ""The pressures of being able to maintain service delivery is becoming more and more challenging and with certain aspects we are only able to cover some critical services - that isn't anything that anybody ever came into this job to do, to have to choose between who you may or may not be able to help."" She said there had been times when there had not been enough staff to provide care. ""I know of examples in my own authority and across Wales where [senior] officers have stepped in to take on different roles. They've rolled up their sleeves, literally, and staffed care homes and other services to keep people safe."" She said numerous roles in social care, including social workers, occupational therapists and those working in domiciliary care, had been hit. In May 2020, 15% of the local authority's social services workforce had been absent due to sickness, including Covid-19. Ms Stubbins described a ""constant anxiety"" while waiting to hear about new cases or deaths - at first in care homes - but since Christmas she said there had been more cases in the community and children's homes. ""We are literally managing day-by-day because we don't know what tomorrow will bring. We're constantly firefighting.  ""There's no time to stop, think and try and plan ahead and that's really, really difficult.""

National Lottery funding helps those hit by Covid,"Groups which work with people who have been most affected by Covid-19 have been awarded more than Â£2m from the National Lottery Community Fund. The Â£2,365,010 will be split among several organisations across Northern Ireland. They include groups helping people struggling to make ends meet, the elderly and minority communities. The largest grant - of almost Â£500,000 - will support young people in care, or who have recently left it. Voice of Young People in Care (Voypic) will use the Â£499,595 for community mentor and advocacy programs. Caoimhe Coyle, area manager at Voypic, said care leavers had been the ""most vulnerable"" of the age groups they support since the pandemic hit. ""They're very isolated, because a lot of statutory support stops at 21 and they're really out on their own,"" she said. ""We have found that unless they are embedded in their community they'll struggle so having a community mentor is a real lifeline for them."" Ms Coyle added that the money would help the organisation to directly support young people who have been in care, including running coaching and community support networks. Seventeen-year-old Maddison, who was in care as a young person who is now a leader in Voypic said she joined the organisation to be heard. ""I am really pleased that this funding will allow them to support many other people like me, helping them to become leaders in their communities,"" she said. Mandarin Speakers Association Derry will put its Â£9,600 grant into promoting diversity and celebrating cultural traditions. Yang Zhou, the group's chair, said the money would allow the group to share their culture with the local community. Clanmil Housing Association will use its Â£9,990 grant for technology and training to help its tenants stay connected. Claire Darby, a senior engagement officer at the association, said: ""It's so important our tenants don't feel excluded as a result of not having the equipment or digital skills. ""This funding will help support tenants who want to get involved, have their say and help shape our services."" The Breen Centre in Ballymoney, County Antrim, has received a similar amount - Â£9,994 - which will help it to support local people in need. Darran Wallace, the project coordinator at the centre, said: ""Our volunteers are currently delivering food parcels to community groups, schools and individuals who have been impacted by the pandemic, helping them practically as well as keeping them connected to their community."" Kate Beggs, the Northern Ireland director of the National Lottery Community Fund, said: ""We know that even a small amount of money can really change lives.

'Let charities vaccinate the homeless' - call,"By Richard EvansBBC News Charities have urged the Welsh Government to allow them to administer the Covid vaccine to people who are homeless or addicted to drugs. The Kaleidoscope Project said charities have the experience and trust of vulnerable groups who ""often fall out"" of NHS support. Homeless charity The Wallich has also called for a ""targeted programme"". The Welsh Government said health boards are working to ensure every eligible adult is vaccinated. Before securing a sleeping pod for homeless people, Junior Samuels, 39, was sleeping rough on the streets of Newport. Drug addiction has been an ""ongoing struggle"". Mr Samuels said he had little time to think about the risk of Covid-19 while coping with the challenges of homelessness, mental health and his addiction. ""Of course I'm concerned about it [Covid] but there's really nothing I can do about it is there?"" He said any information he might receive about a vaccination would come through Kaleidoscope, who provide intervention care for him and others in similar situations. ""They're the ones that I turn to... the ones I trust."" It is not only that trust that makes the charity well-placed to provide the vaccine. Chief executive Martin Blakebrough said their nurses already have the experience of providing medical care - including injections. He insists the charity does not want their users to jump the queue. However with so many of its users lacking basic provisions to even receive an appointment date, or travel to the vaccination centre, he fears many will slip through the system. ""They often live in hostels, shared accommodation or they're on the street, so their susceptibility to Covid is very high, and it is something that could go through the community very quickly,"" he said. ""It seems to me that as we provide a lot of medical services to this client group it would be more sensible for us to provide that vaccination.  ""It doesn't make sense. We have nurses and they provide vaccines for hepatitis B, for example, so we're not unused to giving jabs."" Many of the organisation's workers are considered front line staff and have received vaccinations. Elwyn Thomas, an outreach and harm reduction worker for Kaleidoscope, said the charity had established trust with its service users: ""There is a place Kaleidoscope, and other third-sector drug services in Wales, could assist in the rollout of this vaccine,"" he said. ""This is a cohort of people that I know, they trust me, they trust my colleagues with intimate details, with their health care, so these are things that we already do."" The charity said its facilities could be used to help vaccinate other people who struggle to reach vaccination centres, as well as its service users. Homelessness charity, The Wallich, has supported the bid from Kaleidoscope. However Dr Lindsay Cordery-Bruce, the charity's chief executive, said only about 12% of their workforce had been vaccinated, which was ""still too low for the amount of risk"". ""Our teams, who are working in temporary accommodation environments, are no less deserving than people who work in care homes"", she said.  Dr Cordery-Bruce called on the Welsh Government to set up a ""special, targeted programme"" for homeless people who face barriers when accessing healthcare. ""We have a fleet of welfare vehicles that could be used to make sure the vaccine goes out into the communities where it's most needed,"" she said. The Welsh Government said health boards and local authorities are working to ensure vaccinations are offered to every eligible adult, including the homeless. ""We have welcomed a number of volunteers with a clinical background to support the Covid-19 vaccination programme in Wales,"" a spokesperson said. ""It is important that vaccinations are carried out under the national arrangements in formal healthcare settings to ensure that the safety, quality or efficacy of the vaccine is not compromised.""

Covid: 'There is guilt every day when I go home',"By Thomas MackintoshBBC News, London Since coronavirus reached the UK about a year ago, there have been more than 670,000 positive cases in London alone. On 9 February 2020, a patient who had just returned from China arrived at Lewisham Hospital in the back of a taxi. She was London's first documented Covid-19 case. At first there was a trickle of Covid patients at the south-east London hospital, but within weeks staff were overwhelmed. Operating theatres and other areas were turned into temporary intensive care units. At the peak of the first wave, staff were treating about 350 patients at the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust, which runs Lewisham Hospital as well as the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich. At the height of the second wave, there were 500 positive Covid cases, and the trust came close to running out of room.  How are the medical professionals at the hospital faring after a year on the front line? Itohan Ibude runs Lewisham's Chestnut Ward. The 39-year-old nurse is used to seeing a high turnover of patients, but the volume of coronavirus cases was like nothing she had ever witnessed. ""Patients with Covid generally have problems breathing,"" she says. ""It's very distressing for staff to see people struggling for breath.  ""It's hard for our staff to see a deteriorating patient admitted to ICU and we have regular debrief sessions to help us all cope."" For Ms Ibude, from Bellingham in south-east London, there are many days she cannot forget. ""The first wave was patients with comorbidities,"" she says. ""This second wave, we have had younger patients come in.  ""We had a family of three admitted to this ward. Two of them recovered but sadly the dad passed away. That made it worse for me knowing how that story ended.  ""I am a mum myself, I did think how it was going to be for [his wife]... there is guilt every day when I go home. ""The guilt will always be there. As a nurse, what we are used to, and see the majority of the times, is seeing that patient go through deterioration, through the phase of improvement and then discharged. But when you see people deteriorate, you feel you haven't done anything even though you have done everything.  ""Sometimes when I leave here I sit in my car for 20 minutes. I think of my whole day, but I know that reflection is not going to change anything."" At a time when Covid-19 was still a mystery virus in China, junior doctor Ed Scott was starting a new role in the Ugandan capital of Kampala. The 29-year-old anaesthetist was taking some time out from treating patients at the Lewisham Hospital to help African children with cleft palates and other medical conditions. But his plans changed. ""They were starting to shut down borders in Uganda,"" he says.  ""It was either trying to leave and come back or potentially be stuck there for the foreseeable future. I knew it was difficult in Lewisham, I had friends and colleagues saying how busy they were. ""Everyone was stretched pretty thin; nurses working ridiculously hard, physiotherapists and other staff on the ward faced with more work than they were used to."" Nearly 1,000 patients are known to have died with Covid across the NHS trust. Many of the patients who do die on the wards do so alone, as there is a strict no-visitor policy to stop further infections. For Dr Scott this is the worst thing about the pandemic. ""We do our best to update family members to let them know what is going on with their loved ones,"" he says. ""If we have got 25 or so patients in critical care and you're one of four doctors on the ward then you're making up to six calls a day.  ""Unfortunately, a lot of them are not happy calls... they are calls discussing patients not doing very well or bad news where patients have died.  ""Making those conversations four, five, six times a day and can be really difficult.  ""I think we are all trying to remain as positive as we can be. There is a light at the end of the tunnel so we are all clinging on to those positive thoughts."" NHS research revealed a third of coronavirus deaths between 1 March and 11 May were linked to people with diabetes. It has meant specialist diabetes consultant Dr Mohamed Bakhit has had to monitor his patients even more closely. ""In the first wave we noticed that many people were coming in with coronavirus who were not known to have diabetes,"" Dr Bakhit says. ""They would come in with quite a bad diabetes presentation and would have high glucose levels, and their organs would just start shutting down, and we wondered what was going on.  ""With time and more studies, we now know that if you have diabetes the likelihood that you get a bad coronavirus infection is higher.  ""We also know that even if you don't have diabetes, contracting coronavirus can progress into having diabetes via various mechanisms including affecting how your pancreas produces insulin.""  The mortality rate is much lower in the second wave of coronavirus, in part because doctors are armed with this kind of knowledge.  Steroids are more commonly prescribed than they were during the first wave, although as Dr Bakhit points out, this can cause problems. ""Steroids can sometimes induce diabetes. Also, some patients who are admitted with Covid have undiagnosed diabetes.  ""Diabetes with Covid is difficult to manage and control, and I need to see patients on a daily basis.  ""The workload has increased as follow-up is really important for diabetic patients, so the team has to make many calls each day to patients who have been discharged. ""A high proportion of Covid cases are amongst people with diabetes, although we still don't understand why this is. ""Numbers are coming down quite quickly, but we have to be cautious and anticipate what happens next. We look at things as they happen but hopefully we will get back to normal as more people get the vaccines."" Harriet Bryce works as a respiratory physiotherapist and would normally treat patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis, but for the past year she has been focused on treating coronavirus patients. ""I wasn't at work the day the first patient came to Lewisham, but coming in on the Monday there was definitely a different sense in the air... of fear, the unknown, and what we would expect over the coming days and weeks."" Respiratory physiotherapy is a key part in the recovery of Covid patients. Ms Bryce says many patients come to Lewisham Hospital gasping for air.  ""As they get better I start rehabilitation, which begins in critical care even when patients are sedated,"" she adds. ""I move their limbs while they are asleep, and position them to help with their joints and skin. As they wake up I get them to do simple bed exercises, and I then get them sitting up in bed, sitting in a chair, and eventually walking to build up their strength. ""Sometimes patients need further rehab once they are discharged to help them get back to doing daily tasks and get their lives back. ""What we love is seeing a patient recover and progress towards going home. It makes it all worthwhile.  ""It is extremely rewarding when we see patients get better and hearing back from patients - a few have been in contact to let us know how they are getting on and it is those memories you really need to hold on to to keep going through this second wave.  ""We have to stay positive and hope that the end is in sight."" For more London news follow on Facebook, on Twitter, on Instagram and subscribe to our YouTube channel.

South Korea launches Covid test for pet cats and dogs,"Pet cats and dogs in the capital city of South Korea will be tested for Covid-19 if they show symptoms, the Seoul metropolitan government has said.  It comes a few weeks after the country reported its first Covid-19 case in an animal - a kitten.  Only pets which show symptoms like fever or breathing difficulties after being exposed to human carriers of the virus will be tested.  The pet must quarantine at home if it tests positive for the virus.  It is not necessary for the pet to be sent into an isolation facility as there is no evidence Covid-19 can be spread between humans and pets, said Park Yoo-mi, a disease control official at a virtual press briefing, according to a Yonhap report. But if the pet's owners are hospitalised with Covid-19, or are too ill or too old to take care of it, the pet will be taken into quarantine at a city-run facility.  In South Korea, human patients with Covid-19 are generally put in quarantine facilities if they do not need hospital treatment. Ms Park reminded residents to keep their pets ""at least two metres away from people and other pets when walking them"".  Earlier last month, a kitten that was found at a religious facility in the southeastern city of Jinju was found to be infected, according to Yonhap news.  Health authorities suspect that a mother and daughter, who were staying at the facility, had passed the virus on to the kitten. Both have tested positive for Covid-19.  Experts had previously said it was highly unlikely that a dog or cat could transmit the virus to people, though research has shown that cats may be able to carry the virus and pass it on to other cats.  Globally, several pets have tested positive for the virus - though such cases are generally quite rare.  Last month, two gorillas in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park contracted Covid-19 from a human handler - the first known case of infections in apes.  It has also been found in a number of other wild animals, including lions and tigers in the Bronx Zoo in New York and lions at Barcelona Zoo in Spain.

"Five countries, five winter lockdowns: Tips on coping","By Alice EvansBBC News It's hard to stay positive during lockdown, particularly in the winter months. You might be feeling just as frosty, gloomy and miserable as the UK's weather forecasts. But last year, millions of people across the world experienced coronavirus lockdowns in snowy and sometimes sub-zero conditions - so what can we learn from them? Lockdown began in January 2020 in Wuhan, when the city saw lows of -3.6C and a top temperature of 14C. Yilang Zeng experienced the first city-wide lockdown of the pandemic after travelling to visit her parents in Wuhan for Chinese New Year in January. The Emirates airline cabin crew member, aged 28, relished the extended ""holiday"" with her parents, because she had been living in Dubai, since 2016.  Yilang says the cold and wet Wuhan weather made it tempting to leave the heating on all day - but she suggests putting on a jumper and throwing open a window, to get some fresh air inside. And while the two-month lockdown meant Yilang could really settle into family time, she also made a point of bringing her cabin crew etiquette home with her. ""Always compliment the one who cooks,"" she says, because otherwise, ""it might be the longest holiday together with your family"". Yilang's top winter lockdown tips:  Lockdown in Russia began in March 2020. In the city of Murmansk, in the far north-west of the country, temperatures can drop well below -10C at that time of year. ""Remote learning"" takes on whole new levels of meaning for teacher Anna Turkina and her family, who spent last March's lockdown deep in the Arctic Circle in Murmansk - almost 2,000km (1,200 miles) north of Moscow. For Anna, 36, the stay-at-home order to curb coronavirus infections meant being cooped up in her flat with her husband and two children, then aged four and 11. She would wrap the children up warm and persuade them to go out and play on the small balcony to breathe the ""really fresh and very nice air"" - but only for 15 minutes at a time. ""We have really severe winters and it was -15C,"" she adds. The nippy playtimes were part of Anna's strict schedule, which she says must be kept to to avoid ""going mad in such hard times"". Anna's top tips: Lockdown in TromsÃ¸ began in March 2020, when the average temperature was -1.1C, with lows of -8.9C. It rained or snowed almost every day. Ida Solhaug says coping with a winter lockdown is all about mindset. The mindfulness researcher at the University of TromsÃ¸ says my line of questioning - about how to ""get through"" the cold months - is a big part of the problem. She says Brits often see winter as ""something to endure"" rather than ""really embracing winter for what it's worth"". She says adopting a ""positive winter mindset"" could help us cope with the stresses of a lockdown at this time of year. For example, instead of moaning about not being able to meet up in big groups, be grateful that we can wrap up warm and go on a winter walk with one person from another household, Ida says. Cycling to work in the snow or meeting friends outside (at -8C) with a flask of coffee were two ways Ida coped with ""the long Covid winter"" - but she says people in the UK can do far less extreme things to enjoy winter during lockdown. Ida's top tips: Melbourne entered a three-month lockdown during Australian winter in July 2020, when temperatures reached lows of 3.1Cand highs of 17.4C. The luxury of a hot bath helped Rowan Bruce to face the mental pressures of a 112-day lockdown in Melbourne. Rowan found that running a bath, pouring a glass of wine and watching a film or TV programme - all at the same time - became one of the highlights of his week. He particularly enjoyed watching travel shows presented by the celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain: ""If I can't travel, I'll travel with him instead."" ""It's something I'd never really done before, and now it's my favourite thing to do every Saturday,"" says Rowan, 36, who works at a local brewery. ""It's got to the point where everyone knows that between 3:30pm and 4:30pm every Saturday, I'm probably in the tub."" He says the ritual provided structure to his day and became the perfect way to spend a cold afternoon in lockdown. Rowan's friend, Gillian Nix, agrees routine is important - such as dragging her young children out for a daily morning walk - but she says trying to think of fun activities to fill the time can lead to burnout. Gillian says she and her husband, Chris, were full of energy and ideas at the beginning of lockdown. They would organise ""country days"" with their children Alice, six, and Otis, three, where they cooked food, dressed up, and watched films from a different country each week. But the couple began to feel exhausted by thinking of new things to do. In her lowest moments in lockdown, Gillian, 39, said it was important to be kind to herself. ""Allowing yourself to have a bad hour where you just put on kids' TV or YouTube or whatever, that's fine. This isn't your normal parenting style.  ""Before lockdown we would go on day trips, to the beach, or to art galleries, and go out, [but] you can't judge yourself on now because it's not the normal thing. So take it hour by hour."" Gillian and Rowan's top tips: Toronto's average temperature in March 2020, when people were first urged to stay at home due to Covid, was 4.0C, with lows of -7.7C. Snow lay on the ground most days.  ""I think it's important not to pressure yourself with the notion of going outside,"" says Ashwini Selvakumaran. When Canada's prime minister urged people to stay inside and the country went into lockdown, the third-year student at the University of Toronto decided to move out of her flat in the city to stay with her parents in the nearby town of Milton. Ashwini's parents repeatedly encouraged her to go for runs in the bracing cold, but she shrank away from the cold air and snow. ""I love dancing and moving my body to music, and online there were so many videos and free Zumba tutorials and I just did those,"" the 20-year-old says.  ""Not only did it increase my ability to be active inside the house, but it also made me feel happy just being able to relate back to that passion that I love.""

Covid trauma 'also affects stay-at-home ill',"People with breathing problems related to Covid-19 who receive no medical help could still suffer from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, a study suggests. One in three of those on ventilators and one in five in hospital was badly affected, it found. But 11% of thousands who stayed at home with breathing difficulties also experienced flashbacks of that time. The researchers stress the importance of following up on mental health. The study surveyed more than 13,000 people who had had confirmed or suspected Covid-19, most of whom did not have breathing problems. A third of patients who had been on ventilators had all of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which the researchers, writing in BJPsych Open, say is to be expected. These include: But 40% of all Covid patients, including those with no breathing difficulties, had at least one of the symptoms to an ""extremely"" high degree. And this included: Study author Dr Adam Hampshire, from Imperial College London, said the pandemic was likely to be having ""an acute and lasting impact, including for a significant proportion of patients who remained at home with respiratory problems and received no medical help"". ""Struggling to breathe is a traumatic thing to go through,"" he said. ""And there are so many people in that category."" A traumatic event is one where someone's life is threatened, they see they are in danger or they see others dying or being injured. PTSD symptoms can start within six months and continue for years, preventing people moving on with their lives, the study says. The survey was in May, soon after the peak of the first wave in the UK, when 3,000 patients were being admitted to hospital every day.  And in early January, this rose to 4,000 a day. As of this week, nearly 30,000 Covid patients are in UK hospitals, more than 3,000 on ventilators. And since the start of the UK epidemic, about 400,000 have been admitted. The study authors say it is essential to understand the full impact of the virus on mental health to prepare for demand for services. Royal College of Psychiatrists president Dr Adrian James said: ""It is clear that Covid-19 can have serious mental-health consequences.  ""This virus isn't just a threat to our physical health. ""It also poses significant risks to mental health, during and following the illness. ""Many of those fortunate enough to survive their ordeal will experience a significant impact on their mental health.   ""Effective and joined up follow-up care must be provided after discharge. ""And mental-health services must be adequately expanded to treat increasing numbers of people with PTSD symptoms.""  The main treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are psychological therapies and medication, according to the NHS website. Before the pandemic, there was evidence that one in 10 of those admitted to intensive care would go on to experience PTSD. Rosie Weatherley, from the charity Mind, said the increase suggested by the study was ""concerning"". ""While some will recover without long-term effects, others will need help to overcome the trauma they have experienced,"" she said.    ""If you (or someone you know) have been living with distressing symptoms for over a month after being treated in ITU, or after any other traumatic event, you should speak to your GP, who can refer you for specialist help.""

NHS Covid app has told 1.7 million to self-isolate,"By Leo KelionTechnology desk editor The NHS Covid-19 app has told 1.7 million people in England and Wales to self-isolate to date. Health ministers have also revealed they believe it has prevented about 600,000 cases of the disease. In a further disclosure, internal data indicates that about 16.5 million people are currently actively using its contact-tracing tool. That figure is 24% below the app's latest download tally, which is the government's preferred measure. The discrepancy is likely to be down to people uninstalling the app, turning off its contact-tracing capabilities, or simply failing to have activated it in the first place. Each handset actively taking part sends a digital ""heartbeat"" once a day to the Amazon computer server involved, allowing the current usage figure to be calculated. And while the number of total downloads has slowly grown from 20.2 million to 21.7 million over the past two months, the number of phones pinging the server has been more or less flat. This represents the first detailed data released about the app's use since it was made widely available to people in England and Wales in September.  Scotland, Northern Ireland, Jersey and Gibraltar have their own separate apps. Baroness Dido Harding, executive chair of the NHS Test and Trace programme, had been under pressure to release the figures for months, and the BBC unsuccessfully attempted to obtain some of the figures via a Freedom of Information request in November. The intention in releasing the data now is to reassure the public that the app can save lives, and in doing so encourage more people to both install it and follow its advice ahead of lockdowns being eased. ""People who are not following the app's instructions are risking themselves and their colleagues and their families,"" Baroness Harding told the BBC. ""The more you follow the instructions of the app, the fewer outbreaks you'll have in your workplace and the safer it will be."" A spokeswoman added that these instructions include circumstances in which it is recommended to pause the contact-tracing function. The app uses Bluetooth logs to retrospectively warn users if they were at high risk of contagion from someone infected with the virus, who was recently in their vicinity. Alerts can be served within 15 minutes of an infected person approving use of their positive test result. But the system's decentralised nature means neither the person who triggered the warning, nor the authorities, can identify who receives the notifications. Some anonymised data is, however, collected.  For the first time, it has been revealed that: Scientists from The Alan Turing Institute and Oxford University worked to provide further analysis of the app's impact They estimate that 594,000 cases have been averted because of the technology. And they forecast that for every additional 1% of the population that uses the app, the number of Covid cases should fall by 2.3%. The academics have benefited from the fact that the app was retooled in October to take account of the tier system introduced at the time in England, which operated on a local authority basis. This allowed anonymised usage data to be compared between two neighbouring council areas where the spread of the pandemic was similar, but uptake of the app differed. The researchers took account of other factors - including poverty levels - to calculate the degree to which suppression of the virus's spread could be linked to the app. However, they acknowledge that they cannot be certain that usage of the app caused all of the effects being attributed to it. And while they are publishing their work, it has yet to be peer-reviewed. Even so, the firm involved in developing the app said confidence was growing that it is indeed making a difference.  ""The data suggests that we have made a dent in the overall infection rate,"" Wolfgang Emmerich, chief executive of Zuhlke UK, told the BBC. ""What we really have to do now, particularly as we're preparing to come out of lockdown, is to drive that adoption rate back up and to get people to switch [the app] back on again."" Mr Emmerich also revealed that his team had put plans to extend the app to older iPhone models on the back burner, in order to prioritise other new features, but declined to say what they are. Soon after the NHS Covid-19 app was launched last September, we learned one important piece of data - that over 20 million people had downloaded it.  That was a pretty good result compared with take-up of similar apps elsewhere, but what we didn't know until now was something far more important - did it work?  Now these figures do appear to show that plenty of people have been pinged by the app and sent into isolation.  More impressively, research appears to show that in areas where take-up of the app was high, the infection spread more slowly than in places where it was lower.  But other scientists will want to drill down for themselves into whether other factors were at play in the link between high take-up and low infection rates.  Plus the private nature of the app means there are some key questions that can't be answered: Still, using a Bluetooth app to trace people who might be infected with Covid-19 was always an experiment with an untested technology. And the scientists who have been working on this project for many months now feel they've proved that it has made a significant contribution to the fight against the virus.

South Africa halts AstraZeneca vaccine rollout,"South Africa has put its rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold after a study showed ""disappointing"" results against its new Covid variant. Scientists say the variant accounts for 90% of new Covid cases in South Africa. The trial, involving some 2,000 people, found that the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate cases. But experts are hopeful that the vaccine will still be effective at preventing severe cases. South Africa has recorded almost 1.5 million coronavirus cases and more than 46,000 deaths since the pandemic began - a higher toll than any other country on the continent. The country has received one million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab and was preparing to start vaccinating people. On Monday, the World Health Organization (WHO) warned against jumping to conclusions about the efficacy of Covid vaccines. Dr Katherine O'Brien, the WHO's director of immunisation, said it was very plausible that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine would still have a meaningful impact on the South African variant, especially when it came to preventing hospitalisations and death.  ""Comparing from one piece of evidence to the next really can't be done without a sort of level playing field,"" she said, referring to the evaluation of different trials in different populations and age groups.  Dr O'Brien stressed that the WHO's expert panel held ""a very positive view"" of proceeding with the use of the vaccine, including in areas where variants were circulating, but that more data and information would be needed as the pandemic continued. South Africa's Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said his government would wait for further advice on how best to proceed with the AstraZeneca vaccine in light of the findings. In the meantime, he said, the government would offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks.  The trial was carried out by researchers at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa and the UK's Oxford University, but has not yet been peer reviewed.  The trial's chief investigator, Prof Shabir Madhi, said it showed that ""unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness"". Prof Madhi said the study had not been able to investigate the vaccine's efficacy in preventing more serious infections, as participants had an average age of 31 and so did not represent the demographic most at risk of severe symptoms from the virus. The vaccine's similarity to one produced by Johnson & Johnson, which was found in a recent study to be highly effective at preventing severe disease in South Africa, suggested it would still prevent serious illness, according to Prof Madhi. ""There's still some hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine might well perform as well as the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a different age group demographic that I address of severe disease,"" he told the BBC. Other experts were also hopeful that the vaccine remained effective at combating more serious cases. ""What we're seeing from other vaccine developers is that they have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses and what that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases, but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease,"" Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford's lead vaccine developer, told the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday. She said developers were likely to have a modified version of the injection against the South Africa variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, later this year. Ministers in the UK have sought to reassure the public over the effectiveness of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said the injection appeared to work well against dominant variants in the UK, while Health Minister Edward Argar said there was ""no evidence"" the vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness. Early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, while AstraZeneca has said its vaccine provides good protection against the UK variant first identified late last year. Early results also suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings.  What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus.  Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this. The South Africa variant carries a mutation that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread.  However, there is no evidence that it causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have found cases of the variant. Many South Africans have reacted with shock and disappointment at news that the 1.5 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines will not be as effective as experts had hoped against the new variant first discovered here in November.  While there are now more questions than ready answers, the message from health officials is that all is not lost. They believe the vaccine may still be effective in preventing severe illness and go some way in reducing the number of people who need to be admitted into hospital for treatment.  This is important in a country where some 80% of the population cannot afford private health care and rely on state hospitals - which are currently overstretched - for health care.  So what's the plan now? South Africa's health minister has said they will take a steer from local scientists on how to repurpose the vaccine to get the most out of it.  It has been suggested that the vaccine may be useful if given to the older population and to people with co-morbidities.  In terms of managing people's concerns, the government and scientists may need to go the extra mile in reassuring citizens that there is still a plan in place and lives can and will be saved.

Mountain-fall rescuer has 'life-changing injuries',"A mountain rescuer suffered ""life-changing injuries"" while trying to help a camper breaching Covid rules in the Lake District is in a stable condition. The 60-year-old fell 500ft (150m) when his team was called out to Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass, on Saturday. Patterdale Mountain Rescue said the volunteer faced a ""long road to recovery"" but was in ""good spirits"".  Two men, who had travelled to the Lake District from Leicester and Liverpool, have been fined Â£200 each. Rescuers were deployed to the scene, between Patterdale and Ambleside, after police were alerted at about 00:30 GMT on Saturday that one of the campers, a 47-year-old man with a ""pre-existing"" medical condition, was ill with chest pains. However, during the rescue, the volunteer fell down ""steep ground"" and suffered injuries including facial and spinal fractures. Team leader Mike Rippon described it as a ""truly avoidable accident"" and said despite warnings for the public not to travel it was ""disappointing"" that people continued to do so. Of his injured colleague, he added: ""He's in good spirits, probably unaware of the operations that will be required to improve his condition. ""From a team leader point of view, it's that dreaded call over the radio with a team member suddenly saying we've lost a team member or there's an injury occurred. ""It's turning a rescue into another rescue."" He thanked other agencies who came to help, including the Coastguard helicopter which had attended amid ""pretty rubbish"" weather conditions. The rescue volunteer was airlifted to the Royal Preston Hospital. The camper was taken to Carlisle Infirmary with chest pains but was later discharged. Cumbria Police said the Â£200 fines issued to the men who had travelled to the area was the ""only legal penalty available"" in the circumstances. Assistant Chief Constable Andy Slattery said the visitors had breached Covid rules by travelling together in the same vehicle and camping on the fells. ""I'm sure they are extremely remorseful for their actions,"" he added. ""Set Covid aside, anybody who ventures up in the fells can have an accident and anybody who has accident can't foresee what was likely happen to the mountain rescue.  ""That doesn't lessen the anger and the frustration that people feel about this but they had no way of knowing that would happen. ""The county is still under an enormous amount of strain and we are asking people not to take unnecessary risks, to stay low level if they can, stay local when they are exercising.

Covid surge tests as variant cases confirmed,"Surge testing for coronavirus is to be introduced in parts of Manchester after four cases of a new mutation of the Kent variant of Covid were confirmed. More than 10,000 tests are planned after cases of the E484K mutation were found in two unconnected households. Testing will take place in the Fallowfield, Hulme, Moss Side and Whalley Range districts, with extra testing centres opening. Manchester City Council said volunteers would go house-to-house offering tests. The council said it was working with Public Health England and NHS Test and Trace and everyone in the designated areas would be given a PCR swab test with results coming back within days.   The surge testing will begin on Tuesday, targeting people who do not have symptoms but live or work within the testing boundary area.   Surge testing is the rollout of additional community testing of people who do not have any coronavirus symptoms. It aims to help scientists and public health officials learn more about mutated Covid-19 variants. It will also help reduce the spread of infection by finding asymptomatic cases and prompting people to self-isolate. David Regan, Director of Public Health, Manchester City Council, said: ""We all know that the virus will change over time and it's important that we investigate new strains to understand how they might spread. ""This is exactly what we're doing with the intensive testing in parts of Manchester, with local testing units and people going door-to-door to offer people tests.   ""There is no evidence that this variant will be resistant to the vaccines or causes a more severe illness, and it is not yet known if the strain can be passed more easily between people, but it is really important that everyone who lives in the boundary area and is over the age of 16 plays their part and gets a test."" Councillor Bev Craig, the council's executive member for adult health and well-being, said: ""It's understandable that some residents in the area may be concerned by all this, but we need to remember that it's very normal for viruses to mutate. ""We are following the public health approach to react to the new variant and we will be working... to ensure as many people as possible know how to get a test so we can understand more about this version of the virus.""

PM 'very confident' in Covid vaccines used in UK,"Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" in the Covid vaccines being used in the UK, amid concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness against the South Africa variant. The vaccines are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness, the PM said.  A small study found the Oxford jab gave ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. But scientists are confident it will protect against serious disease. Some 147 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK. However, the Oxford vaccine has shown to provide good protection against the so-called Kent variant, which remains the dominant strain in the UK. The prime minister said: ""We're very confident in all the vaccines that we're using. ""It's important for people to bear in mind that all of them, we think, are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against serious illness and death, which is the most important thing."" England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, told a Downing Street briefing that initial data from Pfizer-BioNTech, Novavax and Janssen - all of whose vaccines the UK has ordered - suggested they had a ""substantial effect at reducing serious illness"". He said the latest study of the Oxford vaccine in South Africa did not change his view that the Oxford vaccine would be ""rather likely"" to have an effect on severe disease. Prof Van-Tam said headlines about the study have been ""a bit scary"" but his advice to anyone ""on the edge"" about whether they should wait to get vaccinated would be: ""Do not delay, have the vaccine that will protect you against the current threat."" ""Early data"" suggested the South Africa variant did not have any advantage over the Kent variant, so it was unlikely to become dominant in the UK in the short term, he said. ""There is no reason to think the South Africa variant will catch up or overtake our current virus in the next few months."" The Oxford-AstraZeneca and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines are currently being rolled out in the UK, where nearly 12.3 million people have been given a first dose according to the latest figures - almost one in four adults. Another 14,104 confirmed cases were reported on Monday and a further 333 deaths were recorded within 28 days of a positive test, bringing the total to 112,798. But the numbers in hospital remain higher than the previous peak in April last year, at 29,326. Mr Johnson said the vaccines ""remain a massive benefit to our country"" and he has ""no doubt that vaccines generally are going to offer a way out"". ""Yes we're doing everything we can to contain new variants but we're also increasingly confident that science, medicine, is gaining the upper hand over coronavirus and all its variants,"" he added. Dr Katherine O'Brien, director of immunisation at the World Health Organization, said it was ""really plausible"" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine might still have a a ""meaningful impact"" on the South African variant, especially in preventing serious illness and death. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS would issue booster jabs against variants if necessary, and had placed a new order for 50 million doses with vaccine company CureVac. The deal is intended to rapidly develop vaccines, including using the mRNA technology already deployed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, in the UK ""so we will be prepared for whatever the future might bring"", Mr Hancock said. Approving revised vaccines for booster shots would take ""a matter of weeks rather than a matter of months"", Prof Van-Tam added. Mr Hancock also said the government had ordered 20 million more rapid tests so it could expand workplace testing to all businesses with more than 50 employees in sectors that are currently open. Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about the Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this - and as things stand they remain very effective against the virus that is dominant in the UK. In South Africa, where the variant - known as 501.V2 or B.1.351 - accounts for 90% of new coronavirus cases in the country, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been put on hold awaiting further advice. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the South Africa variant is the ""single biggest risk"" in the pandemic at the moment, but added that the government was taking too long to introduce controls at the border, ""leaving a back door open at a vital stage in the battle against the virus"". Mr Johnson said border controls could play a greater role against new variants once infection rates are further reduced in the UK. Dr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""it's very possible"" the South Africa variant could already be quite widespread in the UK. The ""surge testing"" taking place in certain areas in England ""really needs to be effective"" to halt its spread, he said, but ""sadly we may be in a similar situation to the Kent variant"", which eventually spread across the whole country. Additional surge testing is taking place in a number of areas in England where the South Africa variant has been found, including parts of Surrey, Bristol, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Walsall, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire.  On Monday evening the Department of Health announced that surge testing would also be deployed in parts of the M14, M15 and M16 postcode areas in Manchester. South Africa's suspension of the rollout of the vaccine is only ""temporary"" at this stage and the ""context is a little bit different"" to the UK where the Kent variant is the dominant strain, he added. The new study of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines.

'Wonderful' nurse remembered with applause,"A nurse who continued to ""put the needs of others before her own"" while battling Covid-19 has been remembered by her grieving family and colleagues.  Estrella Catalan, 52, died on Friday at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH), where she had worked for almost two decades. She had been receiving treatment in the hospital's critical care complex. Her husband and sons joined staff outside the hospital for a minute's silence, followed by applause. Staff at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn and the James Paget Hospital in Gorleston, where Ms Catalan worked earlier in her career, joined in with the tribute.  In January, the BBC filmed Ms Catalan, an emergency department nurse, as her NNUH colleagues treated her for the disease.  She said she was desperate to get better so staff could help other patients.  A tribute on GoFundMe, written by friend Jenelyn Bales, said such selflessness was typical of Ms Catalan, who had worked in Norfolk since arriving from the Philippines.  ""To her colleagues, she is the most caring, conscientious and hardworking person a department could ask for,"" she said. ""She puts the needs of others first before her own.  ""Her selflessness and dedication carried on even when she was on her hospital bed, she still thought and talked about when she could go back to work to help patients and colleagues throughout this pandemic."" The fundraising page - which described her as ""compassionate, loving, fun and caring"" - and another set up by a member of staff, have together raised more than Â£45,000 to support her family and pay for her funeral.  It is with great sadness that we mourn the loss of Staff Nurse Estrella Catalan â a much-loved colleague and hugely respected member of our NNUH family.Thank you to everyone across the NHS and local community who joined the minuteâs silence for her this morning. pic.twitter.com/cLXHDNW8f2 On Friday, chief executive of NNUH NHS Foundation Trust, Sam Higginson, called Ms Catalan a ""wonderful person and a caring and conscientious nurse, who loved to teach and mentor students"". ""Our deepest and heartfelt condolences are with Estrella's loved ones and friends at this very difficult time, and with all those who worked alongside Estrella and knew her,"" he added. ""This is a heartbreaking reminder of the situation we are facing every day to help others and we want to thank our staff for their ongoing courage and commitment during the pandemic.""

Over 70s in parts of Wales 'to call for vaccine',"People over the age of 70 or extremely high risk living in parts of Wales are being urged to call the NHS to book in for their Covid-19 vaccination. Health boards have called on people to contact them if they have not yet had an appointment for a jab. It comes as the number of people who have died with coronavirus in Wales passed 5,000. In north Wales, Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said it had appointments available this week. The call comes after it was confirmed more than 600,000 people in Wales have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine as Wales overtook the other UK nations for the first time in the percentage of the population getting a first jab dose. People aged over 70, or in high priority groups, had been urged not to call their GPs or health board for an appointment, with letters being sent to households. But health boards in Wales have now put out messages urging those in the top priority groups - over 70s, those classed as ""extremely clinically vulnerable"", and any NHS or social care workers - who have not been contacted to get in touch. However, they have warned they were being ""inundated with calls"" and urged those who were not yet due the vaccine to wait to be contacted. On Monday, the UK government urged people over the age of 70 in England, who had not yet been given an appointment, to contact their health board ""urgently"". Cardiff and Vale University Health Board urged people in priority groups one-four to get in touch, with people aged 75 or over being told to call their GPs. ""We will start scheduling cohorts 5, 6, and 7 from 15 February and will update you on how you will be contacted,"" the health board said. Hywel Dda health board chief executive Steve Moore said he was confident everyone in groups one-four would have been offered the vaccine in the west Wales area by Monday. 87,440 is today's big vaccination number! ðWe want to have vaccinated, with their first dose, everyone in priority groups 1 to 4 who wants the vaccine by this Sunday.You can find more information on our website here: https://t.co/Xzaccr9Xdx pic.twitter.com/ssBEbqMaDY Anyone aged 70-74, or classed as clinically extremely vulnerable, or shielding, are being urged to contact the health board's booking centre. ""However, people change phone numbers or move to a new house and may not always update their contact details with health services,"" he said. ""This is why we want to make absolutely sure no one has missed an appointment for their vaccination."" There had previously been criticism that the vaccination rollout in Wales had faced a slower start than the rest of the UK. Wales' aim is to ensure just under 750,000 people - including health workers and people aged over 70 - get a first dose by mid-February. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have been asking people to wait until contacted directly by the NHS.  However, as the pace of our vaccination programme increases, we are starting to ask  people over 70  to get in touch if they haven't been invited for their vaccination.""

NI motorists 'turned back' at Irish border,"People driving from NI into the Republic of Ireland are being turned back at the border if they do not have an essential reason for travel. NI residents face fines from Monday if they are caught crossing the border without ""a reasonable excuse"". The unprecedented step has been taken by the Irish government in a bid to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Anyone engaged in cross-border travel in breach of Ireland's Covid-19 restrictions will be fined â¬100 (Â£88). A number of Garda (Irish police) checkpoints were operational along the border from 07:00 local time.  At a checkpoint near Emyvale in County Monaghan, Insp Adrian Durcan said some people had ""turned back"" when requested. ""We have engaged with a few people who have not had essential reasons and on the advice of the guards, they have turned back,"" he said. ""I think it was three so far this morning."" Insp Durcan said fines would be issued to those not complying with the regulations. ""They will receive the fine and have 28 days to pay the fine, failure to pay that fine will result in a court appearance,"" he said. ""If they don't pay it we will issue a summons in respect of the offence and we will follow through on that summons."" Northern Ireland residents who have to cross the border for essential work or essential purposes, such as seeking medical treatment, will be exempt from fines.  Public health guidance in NI says people ""should not travel in or out of Northern Ireland except where it is essential to do so"". The new rules are the latest in a series of decisions aimed at reducing travel to and within the Republic of Ireland, but it is the first time that people from Northern Ireland will face financial penalties for non-essential cross-border travel. The Republic of Ireland is currently in the highest level of lockdown, known as ""level five"" in the government's five-stage plan for managing Covid-19.  Level five measures include a strict travel ban which means residents in the Republic of Ireland are temporarily prohibited from going more than 5km (3 miles) away from their home. There are exceptions to the 5km limit for people who have to travel further for essential work; medical reasons; caring responsibilities; and other essential purposes such as shopping for necessities like food. Since January 2021, gardaÃ­ have new enforcement powers which include the right to fine people engaged in non-essential travel. Until now, Ireland's travel restrictions did not apply to people living in Northern Ireland, although Garda checkpoints a short distance from the border during earlier lockdowns did cause some tailbacks for cross-border traffic. The new cross-border fines follow recent amendments to the Irish government's Covid-19 health legislation. The regulations now state that ""any other person who is not ordinarily resident in the state shall not travel within a relevant geographical location without reasonable excuse"". GardaÃ­ said if they stop a car with a driver and two adults who should not be crossing the border, all three will receive a â¬100 fine.  Cyclists and pedestrians will also be liable for fines. ""Travelling to an airport or port to take a holiday abroad is not an essential journey,"" they also warned. Any adult who is detected travelling to an Irish airport or port for a non-essential trip or holiday abroad currently faces a â¬500 fine. A Garda spokeswoman confirmed holidaymakers from Northern Ireland who are stopped by gardaÃ on their way to an airport will be liable for both that â¬500 fine and the â¬100 cross-border fine.

UK variant spreading 'rapidly' through US,"The coronavirus variant that has moved through the UK is now spreading ""rapidly"" through the US, according to a new study published on Sunday.  The more contagious strain is nearly doubling its prevalence among confirmed cases in the US every nine days.  The spread of the variant, known as B.1.1.7, has put added pressure on vaccination efforts worldwide.  The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has predicted it could be the predominant strain by March.  The report, posted on the preprint server MedRxiv, is a collaboration of several researchers and scientists. It has not yet been peer-reviewed or published in a journal.  Case numbers of the new variant are still somewhat small in the US.  According to the CDC, Florida leads the country in reported cases of B.1.1.7 with 187 as of Thursday, followed by California with 145.  ""Our study shows that the US is on a similar trajectory as other countries where B.1.1.7 rapidly became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 variant, requiring immediate and decisive action to minimize Covid-19 morbidity and mortality,"" the report's authors wrote.  This new strain is 35-45% more transmissible than other strains of the virus currently in the US, the report found.  When the CDC first warned of the new variant's presence in the US in mid-January, it was present in less than 0.5% of cases. By the end of the month, this figure had jumped to 3.6%, according to the study.  The report comes as the United States' winter virus surge passes its peak. Daily cases throughout the country have been falling for about a month, since early January. But the average daily death toll remains extremely high - some 3,000 per day - and hospitals remain under immense pressure.  The B.1.1.7 variant, first discovered in Britain, has so far spread to more than 50 countries. As with the original virus, the risk is highest for the elderly and for those with significant underlying health conditions.  There has been some suggestion that the strain may be associated with a 30% higher risk of death, but the evidence on this is not strong, and the data is still uncertain.   Current vaccines were designed around earlier variants but initial studies have indicated that that the Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccines will all protect against the B.1.1.7 strain.

Confusion in border village over new Covid rules,"Fines for unnecessary cross-border travel are ""confusing"" for NI residents living along the Irish border, a Donegal petrol station manager has said. Ruairi O'Doherty runs McErlean Fuels in Killea, County Donegal.  Most of the village is in the Republic of Ireland but parts are in Northern Ireland.  He said some residents now ""don't know if they're breaking the law or not"". ""People are phoning us asking, 'Can we cross the border'?"" Mr O'Doherty told BBC News NI. Garda (Irish police) may now fine NI residents â¬100 (Â£88) for crossing the border without ""a reasonable excuse"". The new measures apply to anyone who is ""not ordinarily resident"" in the Republic of Ireland. The unprecedented step taken by the Irish government, which came into force on Monday, is an attempt to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. A number of Garda checkpoints were operational along border areas from 07:00 local time on Monday. ""We're finding a lack of clarity, people aren't sure what they are permitted to do, and what they are not,"" Mr O'Doherty said.  ""We're a village that straddles both sides of the border, we are the local shop for both sides of the border in the village. ""It has caused a bit of panic and a bit of fear with people wondering if they can even cross the border for simple things like milk or bread."" Mr O'Doherty said their business, which relies heavily on cross-border trade, has seen a drastic downturn recently in people coming from Northern Ireland. That trade would usually make up about 80% of their overall income, he explained.  ""If we haven't got that trade then it will be a struggle to provide the service that we do."" Mr O'Doherty said fines could potentially affect a lot of businesses along the Irish border - simply because of their location.  ""We see ourselves as the one community, but there is a border there and we don't know if we will be able to cross it as freely as we had been,"" he added. An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) said it continued to implement static and roving checkpoints to check on compliance with travel restrictions nationwide.  ""There is no requirement within the regulations to establish checkpoints within any geographical distance of the border, ie 5km,"" a spokesman added. ""An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na will adopt the approach of the Four Es which will see GardaÃ­ engage, explain, encourage, and as a last resort, enforce.""

Rise in rental bookings for illegal parties,"By Marc EllisonData journalist, BBC Scotland Accommodation rental websites are being used increasingly to book properties for illegal parties, Police Scotland data suggests. Call logs obtained by BBC Scotland show that sites like booking.com were used to hire space for large gatherings over the festive period. Police were  given the power to break up house parties contravening social gathering rules on 28 August last year. Since that date, officers have been called out nearly 7,000 times. Most of Scotland has been in lockdown since Boxing Day with a ""stay at home"" message put down in law. The latest data, received through a Freedom of Information request, showed a marked increase in anecdotal reports of house parties being held at rented accommodation over the festive period. Listed incidents included: A search of one major rental website shows it is still possible to book accommodation in Scotland for up to 16 guests, despite much of Scotland being in lockdown until the end of February. Booking.com said it was committed to informing customers about travel restrictions currently in place in many destinations. The company said it had also set up tools to make it easier for accommodations to provide clear information to guests about what national and local Covid restrictions are in place. A spokeswoman told BBC Scotland: ""In the very rare instance that we are made aware of any unlawful behaviour taking place at a property listed on our site, including house parties that violate the current lockdown restrictions, we investigate thoroughly, co-operate with local authorities or law enforcement, and when necessary, we will block the responsible customer account on our platform."" BBC Scotland reporter Connor Gillies describes his night following the Glasgow police officers tackling illegal parties. ""The night begins at 22:00 in a briefing room at Partick police station. We're called to a tenement in Finnieston.  Inside, as we scale the five flights of stairs the sound of laughing gets louder. The door is banged repeatedly as the occupants ignore the call to answer.  Eventually six fines are issued to a group of students who had been drinking. One of them tells me she's embarrassed.  We get word of a big party nearby. Backup is called with reports the large group is crammed in a top floor flat.  Loud music echoes down the stairwell. Police find 15 rule breakers holding a 30th birthday . The party is over, fines issued and the property owners charged and reported to the procurator fiscal.   Tonight shows there continues to be a stubborn minority who simply don't care about putting the police and public at risk."" While the number of callouts has slightly decreased since mid-September, police officers still attended hundreds of gatherings every week with callouts peaking at nearly 600 over the new year period. The figures also show that while callouts may have declined, the proportion of gatherings in breach of restrictions has not. On average, 73% of the weekly parties attended in December were deemed illegal compared to 33% in September. Police data showed that officers had been alerted to 6,856 gatherings between 28 August and 8 January. However, the force has suggested the number is likely to be greater as house gatherings are typically under-reported. Under-reporting can occur if officers were not assigned, or attended several hours later and did not enter the premises. Internal reports for Operation Talla - the name for Police Scotland's response to the coronavirus pandemic - also highlighted the increased resistance officers are receiving when they attend illegal house parties. These incidents included: The data also revealed that 3,647 fines have been issued, and 486 arrests made, as of 8 January. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Speirs said: ""The vast majority of the public have continued to comply with the regulations.  ""Parties and indoor gatherings of different households are not permitted and we will continue to use our enforcement powers to disperse large groups of people where necessary. ""Policing during the pandemic has always been challenging and it remains so."" Operation Talla reports also documented a number of large-scale student gatherings including: While only 5% of all callouts were related to student parties, internal police documents suggested they were still a considerable concern. One Operation Talla document noted: ""Students are still gathering unlawfully and are more likely to do so in larger numbers than the general population"". Matt Crilly, the president of NUS Scotland, said: ""Students overwhelmingly are following the guidelines and protecting their friends, families and communities.  ""However, we continue to appeal to this small minority of students to comply with the current public health guidance"".

Coronavirus: Evening update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow morning. Boris Johnson says he is ""very confident"" in the Covid vaccines being used in the UK, amid concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab's effectiveness against the South Africa variant. The vaccines are effective in delivering a high degree of protection against against serious illness, the PM said. Meanwhile, England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, told a No 10 briefing there was no reason to think the South Africa variant would catch up, or overtake, the dominant so-called Kent virus in the UK in the next few months. But he stressed there was ""plenty of evidence"" that vaccines being deployed in the UK were effective against this variant, and urged people to get a vaccine. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was working with vaccine suppliers on potential booster jabs to help deal with new variants. People aged 70 or older in England who have not yet had their coronavirus vaccine, but would like to, are being asked to contact the NHS. A national booking system is available that can be accessed online or people can call 119 free of change between 07:00 and 23:00. Doctors want to ensure everyone in an eligible group has had the chance to be immunised. Vaccination can prevent severe disease and save lives. Until now the NHS has asked people to wait until they are contacted to help ensure that those who are most vulnerable are protected first. People aged over 70 in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are being advised that they will be contacted by the NHS with an appointment. Extra hours of academic learning, as well as sport and creative activities, will be needed to help England's pupils make up ground following the pandemic, says the new education catch-up tsar. Sir Kevan Collins told the BBC it was important to ""act quickly"" on making arrangements for the summer and he said that summer schools ""had promise"". Sir Kevan said the most disadvantaged had lost up to seven months' progress. But he also stressed that children were ""amazingly resilient"". In his first media interview, he said the youngest children would ""need to learn to play together"" and to develop the language and social skills needed for school life. The government's initial catch-up plans due to be announced in late February. Take a closer look at how children could make up for lost school time. Heavy snow and ice has brought disruption to parts of the UK, with coronavirus vaccination centres shutting in Essex and Suffolk, as well as in Surrey and Norfolk. Some schools - only open to children of critical workers and vulnerable children during lockdown - have also had to close. Yellow warnings for snow cover much of England and Scotland, as well as parts of Northern Ireland. Police have warned people not to travel, with long delays expected and road closures in some places.  Unlikely internet star Jackie Weaver's fame has risen to new heights - after she was immortalised in a cake. Ms Weaver was trending on social media after a recording of a Handforth Parish Council Zoom meeting - that spiralled into chaos - went viral.  A cut-down version of the planning and environment meeting on 10 December emerged on Twitter on Thursday and soon became a ""must see"" lockdown sensation, piquing the interest of millions by Friday morning. In it, Ms Weaver is seen keeping her cool after being shouted down by several other participants. Ben Cullen, who has been featured on Netflix and Channel 4, said he ""couldn't resist"" recreating her in cake form. The baker, from Chester, said he has had ""a great reaction"" to his latest sponge sensation.  Get a longer daily news briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.

US congressman Wright dies after Covid diagnosis,"US Republican congressman Ron Wright has died aged 67 after testing positive for Covid-19 last month, officials say. The Texas lawmaker ""passed away peacefully"" with his wife Susan by his side on Sunday, his office said. The couple had both been infected with the virus and were receiving treatment at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. Mr Wright, who had also been battling cancer in recent years, is the first sitting member of Congress to die with the coronavirus. On 21 January, he released a statement announcing that he had tested positive for Covid-19. ""I am experiencing minor symptoms, but overall, I feel okay and will continue working for the people of the 6th [Congressional district] from home,"" his statement said.  Mr Wright was elected to the House of Representatives in 2018. Announcing his death on Monday, his office said that he would be ""remembered as a constitutional conservative"" who was ""a statesman, not an ideologue"". ""Despite years of painful, sometimes debilitating treatment for cancer, Ron never lacked the desire to get up and go to work, to motivate those around him, or to offer fatherly advice,"" it added. The office provided no further details. Several members of Congress, from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, have tested positive for Covid-19 over the past year. In December, 41-year-old Congressman-elect Luke Letlow died due to complications from the coronavirus, just days before he was due to be sworn in. The US is by far the world's worst-hit nation, with more than 463,000 coronavirus-related deaths and over 27 million cases since the start of the pandemic. The average number of daily infections in the US, however, has been gradually falling since early January.

Lessons from Australia's hotel quarantine system,"By Frances MaoBBC News, Sydney Australia's hotel quarantine system has been an extremely effective first line of defence against Covid-19. The country has largely eliminated the virus, often going weeks without a locally acquired infection. Hotel quarantine is credited a huge part of that success. But a series of isolated local cases in recent months - all from hotel quarantine leaks - have caused alarm. Since November, three cities have entered snap lockdowns on the back of such infections, aiming to halt outbreaks at their source. But how does the virus keep slipping through what officials hail as a ""world-class"" first defence?  Since March last year, Australia has essentially allowed only returning residents to enter the country, provided they complete a 14-day quarantine - usually in city hotels.  So far, more than 211,000 people have gone through this quarantine. It's a costly but effective method that is used in only a few other nations such as New Zealand, South Korea and Singapore. But if the virus somehow escapes quarantine, the consequences can be severe. Melbourne saw this last July when a quarantined traveller infected a hotel guard, who unwittingly took the virus into the community. The resulting outbreak accounts for over 90% of Australia's 29,000 cases and 909 deaths to date. Eventually, after a punishing lockdown, Melbourne's outbreak was suppressed. Inquiries led to better infection prevention and tracing efforts in all states. In particular, hotel quarantine was tightened up. Despite this, further quarantine breaches have caused most of Australia's virus scares in recent times: in Adelaide in November; in Brisbane last month, and in Perth and Melbourne in the past week. In each case, hotel staff unknowingly caught the virus and took it into the community. None of those workers had breached any safety protocols, officials say. An outbreak of about 180 cases also occurred in Sydney in December, but its origin wasn't definitively tied to quarantine. At the time of Melbourne's outbreak, standards were lower. Guards were found to have socialised together and worked across different hotels, and there were reports of guards mingling with quarantined travellers. These days, however, the rules aim to prevent any such contact. Staff adhere to rigorous cleanliness standards, wear PPE and keep their distance. As a result, many epidemiologists believe only airborne transmissions are causing cases to slip out, most likely through hotel corridors.  Various state governments have acknowledged this is a possibility, but reject suggestions they haven't taken enough action to prevent it. Prof Michael Toole, from the Burnet Institute, adds that with more infectious variants emerging, it's no wonder we're seeing more ""spot fires"" in hotels. But even with Adelaide's breach - which pre-dated the more transmissible variants - it's suspected a security guard became infected while sitting in a corridor outside a room. ""They spent hours poring over CCTV footage to find out what that guard did wrong,"" said Prof Nancy Baxter, head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health. ""And the thing that guard did wrong was breathe air. All that person did was walk the halls, breathing the air. Right there. That should have been the clarion call that we need to do something different."" Many experts argue Australia should better adapt its quarantine to counter the threat in the air. ""If the best time to have considered that Covid-19 is airborne was 10 months ago, then the next best time is now,"" added Prof Baxter. ""The failure to acknowledge the airborne nature is making it difficult to create a very important layer of protection."" According to Prof Baxter, it's not just workers stationed in hallways who are at risk - there is evidence of guest-to-guest transmission too.  In Melbourne last week, a woman caught the virus from a family in a room across a hallway. It's suspected the guests opened doors around the same time to pick up their meal. On Monday, it was reported that a traveller to Sydney tested positive two days after exiting his 14-day quarantine. This also suggested a case of hotel transmission rather than a rare, late-blooming case, Prof Baxter said. Many experts have called for a nationwide reassessment of air flow in hotels used for quarantine. ""If we removed the word Covid and replaced it with the word asbestosis, we would think about it differently,"" said Prof Bruce Thompson from Swinburne University. Current hotel protections work to prevent droplets spreading, but experts argue that aerosols need more barriers. These could include better masks and face shields for workers, upgrading air conditioners, and even picking buildings with better ventilation or windows, balconies, and other openings. Dr Baxter said: ""Some of the hotels may have great air circulation, but I suspect many don't. And the point is I don't know - no-one's talking about it."" On Monday, Victoria - where the latest two cases were found - announced it had implemented new protections.  Workers now had face shields and higher-quality masks, and engineers were reviewing air conditioners and air flows, the state government said. Hotel staff were also being tested outside shift hours every day, and staggering the delivery of meals to guests. ""We make the necessary adjustments to the programme as new evidence comes to light,"" said Health Minister Martin Foley. After South Australia's scare in November, state officials said they were upgrading their hotel ventilation systems and urged other states to follow. Prof Toole points out that the lack of a national standard in hotel quarantine has exacerbated matters. He says it's other measures - such as contact tracing in the community -  that have prevented hotel breaches growing into larger outbreaks. Critics have argued that quarantining in populated city centres amplifies the risk of spread. Could facilities be built instead in Australia's vast inland or remote areas, safely away from most people? It's an idea that is often debated. Supporters of the idea point out that non-hotel quarantine sites are already in use - such as Darwin's Howard Springs facility, an upgraded mining camp which has 3,000 beds. They note that the first Australians who returned during the pandemic - from Wuhan in China - were quarantined in an immigration detention centre on Christmas Island. But many dismiss a desert site as a ""ridiculous"" idea.  They say quarantine sites need to be near major airports for when people arrive, and near good hospitals for those who need treatment. Sites also need access to scores of trained staff, they add. But alternatives could be explored, agree Prof Baxter and Prof Toole. They suggest facilities near smaller, regional cities which have good hospitals and accessible pool of staff. ""Sure it's not cheap, but shutting down Melbourne, shutting down Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth - those are far more expensive things to do,"" says Prof Baxter. There are still 40,000 Australians stranded abroad who wish to come home, putting pressure on the federal government to remove caps on the number of travellers. Australia's reliance on its hotel quarantine programme is not going to lessen any time soon, even as vaccinations progress globally, experts say. That's why the cracks need to be sealed up now, particularly against the new infectious variants, they argue. ""Our main priority has to be protecting the borders from the virus entering,"" says Prof Toole. ""It's the absolute linchpin to our short-term future."" And as hotel quarantine continues to be adapted by other nations around the world, Prof Baxter says: ""What's happened in Australia has highlighted areas that everyone should be concerned about.""

Police planning for summer visitor influx,"Plans are being developed to cope with a large influx of visitors to Dorset at Easter and in the summer, police have revealed. The county's police and crime panel heard the authorities were ""caught out"" when the first lockdown was eased. The summer saw gridlocked roads and anti-social behaviour around beaches and coastal attractions. Dorset Police warned extra funding would be needed to deal with any similar influx this year. A heatwave, combined with the easing of lockdown restrictions which allowed people to travel, brought thousands of visitors to the coast in 2020, culminating with Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council declaring a major incident on 25 June. There were reports of fights, security staff being attacked and illegal overnight camping. Visitors also flocked to Durdle Door on the Lulworth Estate throughout the summer and there were several instances of swimmers getting into difficulties with no lifeguards present. BCP councillor George Farquhar told the police and crime panel meeting: ""There was a lot of pent up frustration and anger with people in any sort of authority, even with people wearing a yellow vest who empty the bins.  ""We were massively caught out."" The panel heard there were no low-loaders available last summer to take away illegally parked cars. There was also no means of sourcing extra bins or portable toilets, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Dorset Police warned at the time that sun seekers were putting ""further strain on emergency services' resources"". Chief Constable James Vaughan said he was confident the county would be better prepared for a flood of holiday makers. ""We are developing a good plan. It's at the forefront of our minds for when we come out of lockdown,"" he said. Mr Vaughan warned there was no extra budget to deal with the situation, although he had pressed the case for extra funding in a meeting with the home secretary.  Police and crime commissioner Martyn Underhill said he held meetings with Dorset Council over the issue of rough sleepers on Weymouth seafront during last summer which had caused ""massive problems"". ""My inbox was bristling with people complaining, but I don't think it will happen again,"" he said. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""We are committed to supporting police throughout the pandemic and have given forces Â£30m to support extra enforcement. ""We are providing the policing system with up to Â£15.8bn next year, including up to Â£151.9m for Dorset Police - an increase of up to Â£7.7m on last year. ""On top of this, we're recruiting an extra 20,000 officers, 6,620 of whom are already in place."" Follow BBC South on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.

Scientists have been running lots of tests and those suggest that despite the vaccines being a less than perfect match for some of the new variants, such as the South Africa one, they do plenty for what matters most - saving lives. Findings already show the Oxford-AstraZeneca offers good protection against the Kent variant of coronavirus that is the most common variant circulating in the UK.

""The vaccine is safe, simple, and will offer you and those around you crucial protection against this virus.""

"Coronavirus deaths in Wales pass 5,000","The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed that more than 600,000 people in Wales - 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September.  International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world.  There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - the worst week was also last month - and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"".  Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, that more lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlier at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures include all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed - and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures, Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

Covid jabs queue means 'hour-and-a-half' wait,"People have been queuing for ""more than an hour-and-a-half"" in freezing weather for coronavirus jabs. The backlog at Home Park in Plymouth led to long queues and frustration among some of those waiting. The Mayflower Grandstand at Plymouth Argyle's ground was turned into a vaccine centre in January. Plymouth NHS Trust blamed ""multiple factors"" including overbooking and people turning up too early and without an appointment. One woman, who said she had been waiting for more than an hour-and-a-half, said: ""They're doing a brilliant job but it's disgusting that you've got to queue out here. ""People could end up going down with pneumonia."" Sue Wilkins, director of mass vaccinations at Plymouth NHS Trust, said the online booking system had been ""offering slightly more bookings than we felt we had the capacity to deliver"". She also said ""a lot of people attended who did not have an appointment"" and some were turning up two or three hours before their slot. Extra vaccinators had been brought in and the frail and disabled had been brought to the front of the queue. About 200 people had also been offered vaccinations elsewhere in the city. ""Our team of caring and compassionate nurses are doing their best to see everyone and we have not wanted to turn anyone away,"" said Ms Wilkins.

Hospital halts staff Covid jabs 'to stop waste',"A major hospital has paused its staff Covid-19 vaccinations because it did not have enough people booked in. Addenbrooke's in Cambridge said insufficient numbers of employees had signed up to justify thawing a box of 1,170 Pfizer vaccines. An email sent to staff last week said jabs were cancelled from Thursday afternoon and would resume on Tuesday. The hospital said: ""More than eight in 10 of our staff, and those closely affiliated, have already had the jab."" Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Addenbrooke's, said staff were able to be vaccinated elsewhere if they wanted a jab. ""The next clinic for colleagues will take place on Tuesday, meaning more staff can get vaccinated and avoiding any doses going to waste,"" a spokesman said. The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine must be kept at a temperature of -70C (-94F) during transportation. It must be thawed before it is given to a patient and can be stored in a normal fridge for only a few days before being used. In the email to staff, seen by the BBC, and first reported in The Observer, the hospital said it was ""disappointing"" for those whose appointments were cancelled, but it ""cannot be in a position where vaccine is wasted"". It encouraged staff to sign up for a vaccine this week as they ""may unfortunately be the last staff sessions available"" until the hospital commences second doses. The email said it would ""follow national policy"" and offer the second jabs 11-12 weeks after the first dose. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

NHS gowns suspended due to packaging concern,"By Phil Kemp & Anna MeiselFile on Four, BBC Radio 4 The use of ten million surgical gowns, bought by the UK government, has been suspended for frontline NHS staff because of how the items were packaged. Sterile gowns were bought for Â£70m from a US firm last year, but safety concerns were raised when they arrived in one layer of protective packaging. The contract had not requested double packaging, as used in sterile settings. The government says all PPE is quality assured, but Labour has called for an inquiry into the awarding of contracts. The BBC has been investigating the purchase of PPE - or personal protective equipment - for NHS staff since the beginning of the pandemic. It has already been revealed how millions of face masks bought by the UK government cannot be used in the NHS as intended. Many of the contracts dated back to last Spring, when the government was scrambling to deal with PPE shortages in hospitals and care homes at the beginning of the pandemic. However, officials at the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) continued to sign large PPE contracts after the first wave of infections was over, in a bid to avoid a repeat of shortages. One of those contracts was a Â£70m deal, signed in June, for the supply of 10.2 million sterile surgical gowns from a US firm called Saiger LLC. The BBC understands Saiger delivered the gowns on time but their use was suspended because of concerns about the way they were packaged. A court document obtained by the BBC shows NHS infection control experts were concerned the gowns were only single wrapped, when in their view they should have been double wrapped if they were to be used in sterile care settings. The document shows there was no requirement - either in the government's published specifications or in its contract with Saiger - for the gowns to be double wrapped. The gowns came from the same firm that paid millions of pounds of UK taxpayer cash to a Spanish businessman to source PPE for the NHS. Last November, the BBC revealed Gabriel Gonzalez Andersson was paid $28m (Â£21m) in UK government cash by Saiger to find PPE as part of two deals. For his work on the Â£70m contract for the surgical gowns - which was separate to those earlier deals - he was in line to be paid a further $16m (Â£12m). However, documents filed in a US court allege that he then stopped doing any work for Saiger, leaving the firm ""scrambling"" to fulfil its contracts by other means. It's not clear whether Mr Andersson received any of the money for this deal. The parties have since agreed for the legal action to be dismissed. In response, Saiger said: ""The government could not have been clearer that we delivered the goods in accordance with the contracts and to the technical specifications requested, that we delivered them on time, and that we delivered them at good value."" The government's decision to award the Â£70m contact for the gowns is currently being challenged in a separate case in the English courts by the campaigning organisation, the Good Law Project. Jolyon Maugham, the project's director, said the government needed to know what it was buying. ""It should be buying from those who are experienced in the complicated business of supplying medical-quality PPE. ""And it also needs to be keeping a careful check on the prices it is paying so that intermediaries aren't able to make tens and tens of millions at public expense."" You can listen to File of 4's Unmasked: Stories from the PPE frontline on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 GMT on Tuesday 9 February or on BBC Sounds. The government is also facing questions over contracts it signed for millions of face masks, which now can't be used as intended in the NHS. In April, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) signed a contract with Pestfix - a small Sussex-based family firm - for Â£168m to supply three types of mask. They included FFP3 particle filtering masks. The BBC has found 17 million FFP3 masks supplied to the Department of Health by Pestfix will not be used as intended because they failed testing. The masks came with ear loops, which the government says now should not be used because of safety concerns. It stopped the use of masks with ear loops in May last year, following discussions with the safety watchdog. However, the government had already bought millions of masks with ear loops. Pestfix told the BBC these masks never entered the NHS supply chain. The BBC has also seen an internal document prepared by the safety watchdog showing another type of FFP3 mask - this time with headstraps on - put forward by Pestfix also failed tests. The document says ""headstraps on several samples snapped"" and ""nosebands fell off on nearly all samples from the first batch"". Pestfix said these were alternative, prototype masks that were provided as a potential replacement. The firm said DHSC did not proceed with the product. ""We are proud of our role in sourcing PPE from Chinese manufacturers to help meet massive shortages in the NHS during the pandemic, with 94% of the 282 million items of PPE we supplied meeting contracts standards,"" the company said. ""Pestfix is working with the government and the Chinese manufacturers responsible for the small percentage of items that did not enter the NHS supply chain to ensure the best possible result for taxpayers.""  However, Labour's shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves has called for an inquiry into the awarding of PPE contracts. ""This area of procurement is one of the ways in which this government has really let people down, particularly our frontline workers during the course of the pandemic,"" she said. ""There should be an inquiry, a rapid review right now into the lessons that we can learn because if we learn lessons we can save lives, and this virus isn't going away."" In a statement, DHSC said PPE is only distributed in the NHS if it meets the relevant standards: ""We have been working tirelessly to deliver PPE to protect our health and social care staff on the frontline, with over 7.6 billion PPE items delivered so far.""

Man charged over Captain Sir Tom Moore tweet,"A man has been charged in Lanarkshire in connection with an offensive social media tweet about Captain Sir Tom Moore. Sir Tom died in Bedford Hospital last Tuesday, aged 100, after testing positive for Covid-19. He had captured the nation's hearts with his fundraising efforts during the first coronavirus lockdown, raising more than Â£30m for NHS charities. The 35-year-old man is due to appear in court later this week. World War Two veteran Sir Tom's family said the last year of his life was ""nothing short of remarkable"" and that he had ""experienced things he'd only ever dreamed of"". A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""On Friday 5 February 2021, we received a report of an offensive tweet about Captain Sir Tom Moore who died on Tuesday 2 February.

Labour urges ministers to 'clean up' Covid contracts,"Labour has challenged the government to ""clean up"" how it awards contracts for Covid work. In an online speech, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said procurement during the pandemic had been ""rife with conflicts of interest"". And she called for a new ethics watchdog to ""guarantee standards"" for spending public money. The government said it has ""robust rules and processes"" to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur. During her speech, Ms Reeves raised questions about contracts awarded to companies that she said have links to the Conservatives. She added that ""cronyism in contracting"" had led to ""unforgivable waste"" and showed the need for tougher transparency rules.  It comes after a National Audit Office report last November found that more than half of contracts by the end of July 2020 had been awarded without competitive tender. As the pandemic struck last spring, there was a scramble to ensure that hospitals and other care settings had adequate supplies of personal protective equipment (PPE). The NAO found that companies recommended by MPs, peers and ministers' offices were given priority, and not enough was done to address potential conflicts of interest by ministers and other government officials. However, it concluded that in cases of potential conflicts of interest involving ministers, all had properly declared their interests and it found ""no evidence of their involvement in procurement decisions or contract management"". The prime minister's press secretary Allegra Stratton said: ""We have robust rules in place to make sure there are no conflicts of interest. There are eight checks involved. It is rigorous."" She said procurement ""had to be done at speed, because in early stages of the pandemic we didn't have enough PPE inside the country. ""The government believes that the beginning of the pandemic we had to act very quickly and we were very successful at that."" She added that all public contracts would be published ""in the fullness of time"".  During her speech, Ms Reeves also called on ministers to end emergency procurement rules brought in at the start of the pandemic, which have streamlined the normal bidding process for contracts.  She said ""bad practices"" introduced at the start of the crisis had worsened, with contracts for protective equipment becoming an ""unseemly gold rush"".  She urged ministers to publish ""all outstanding contracts"" by the end of the month, and for the Freedom of Information Act to cover all new public service contracts outsourced to private firms. She also criticised in the government's record in recovering money from firms that have failed to deliver services adequately or on time.  ""The corporations running so many public services hide behind 'commercial sensitivity'. A shadow state has emerged and it is unaccountable to the people,"" she said.  As well as a new Integrity and Ethics Commission, she called for an ""independent anti-corruption and anti-cronyism commissioner"" to oversee how money is spent. She argued these measures would ""clean up government contracting"" and make the UK a ""world leader in good governance"".

Covid-breach party hotel faces licence review,"A hotel where 200 people were found partying in breach of Covid-19 restrictions will face a licensing review. Police officers broke up four separate parties at the Richmond Apart-Hotel in Liverpool in January. Merseyside Police have called for the review as it is believed the premises on Hatton Garden are ""associated with serious crime"". Its owners The Savvy Hotel Group have been contacted for a comment.  During the police raids, 13 fines were issued, evidence of drug use was found and 11 warnings, including for drugs offences, were handed out to the party-goers.  One woman was also held on suspicion of two counts of assaulting a constable, while a man was arrested on suspicion of breaching bail conditions. The decision for a review comes after a meeting between Merseyside Police and Liverpool Council on Friday, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. The meeting, known as an interim steps hearing, was not open to the public but papers published by Liverpool Council confirmed it was linked to the parties on 31 January. It stated officers had witnessed breaches of coronavirus legislation, constituting ""serious crime and disorder"". A public notice issued later said: ""The grounds for review are that in the opinion of a senior police officer of Merseyside Police the premises are associated with serious crime.""

Snow shuts town's Covid variant test centres,"Covid testing units in a town where 10,000 adults have been urged to take a test have closed due to adverse weather conditions. People in the EN10 postcode of Broxbourne in Hertfordshire were asked last week to be tested after cases emerged of the South African variant.  Hertfordshire County Council said the Broxbourne Lido and Paradise Wildlife Park units were closed on Monday. Door-to-door test deliveries ""will continue as planned"", it added. A Met Office yellow warning for snow is in place across much of the east and south-east of England until midnight on Wednesday - meaning travel disruption is likely. Last week, the government announced all adults in that area would be encouraged to get tested over the next two weeks, whether they have symptoms or not, after confirmation ""an isolated number of cases"" of the variant had been detected. Public health director Prof Jim McManus said the small number of cases in the UK had been picked up by routine surveillance testing so they were ""about to embark on this exercise"" to detect and suppress further cases. Since Tuesday, residents had been able to visit the two mobile testing centres or pick up tests from Wormley Community Centre and Hoddesdon Library. The authority said patients with appointments at the mobile units would receive a cancellation notice by text to cancel but the door-to-door teams - of volunteers, council officers and firefighters - were continuing to visit addresses in the postcode.  In other parts of the county, the Three Rivers and Watford mobile testing units for those with symptoms were also closed on Monday due to the weather. The council said those with appointments would receive a message to rebook from the Department of Health and Social Care. Other rapid testing sites across the county for those without symptoms were open as usual, it added. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

'Kent' Covid-19 strain source of Guernsey outbreak,"A more infectious coronavirus variant is responsible for Guernsey's recent outbreak, health bosses have confirmed. The outbreak was detected on 22 January and has led to 431 infections so far in Guernsey. DNA Analysis of samples from the first four cases confirmed they had the variant of Covid-19 first seen in Kent, Dr Nicola Brink said. The director of public health said the result helped explain the ""extremely rapid spread"" seen in the island. The ""Kent"" B117 variant was spotted in south east England in September and caused a sharp rise in cases before Christmas. It is now present across the UK and in other countries. There were 366 active Covid-19 cases in Guernsey on Monday, with 65 people recovering from the virus since a lockdown was called on 23 January, the latest figures show. Over the weekend 30 Covid-19 cases were discovered, four of which were from an unknown community source and the remaining 26 from contact tracing.  Ten people with the virus are in hospital, two of whom are in intensive care. Two of those in hospital are from a recent outbreak in a care home which led to residents being cared for in hospital while staff self-isolated, the States said.  Dr Brink confirmed there had been a case of the virus detected in a staff member of a second care home. She added this was an ""example of the system working"", as the worker had come forward for testing after developing mild symptoms of coronavirus. ""We immediately then tested all of the residents and all of the staff of the care home and we found no positives at all,"" Dr Brink added. Follow BBC Guernsey on Twitter and Facebook.

Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants',"""Booster"" Covid jabs may be needed in the future when more is known about coronavirus mutations, Wales' Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. It comes after a small study suggested the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South African variant. Mr Gething said the people ""should take comfort"" in jabs being highly effective against the most dominant variants. A total of 13 cases of the variant have been found in Wales. Most - 11 of them - have been linked to international travel. The remaining two were found in Conwy and Neath Port Talbot. Scientists have begun work in on developing booster jabs to tackle changes in the coronavirus.  A total of 147 cases of the South African variant have been found in the UK - testing has been ramped up in areas of England where it has been found. More than 600,000 people in Wales have been given their first dose of a Covid vaccine so far as the coronavirus death toll passes 5,000 people in Wales. At the weekend, Wales overtook the other UK nations for the first time in the percentage of the population getting a first Covid jab dose. Mr Gething said health officials would ""continue to learn and continue to understand"" what more was needed to protect people. ""We said from some time out that the virus will mutate,"" he told a Welsh Government briefing. ""So we know we're going to need to reconsider what we do at various points in time. ""That may mean that in the future we need to have booster programmes or an annual programme as we do with flu every year. But we don't know that for certain yet."" Meanwhile, Wales' health minister rejected proposals for a vaccine passport. The Greece prime minister said he would welcome British holiday makers if they could prove they had been vaccinated.  Mr Gething said the discussion was a ""distraction"", adding: ""It might make great headlines for some people but actually it's not very helpful in terms of where we are in the here and now."" The idea has also been rejected by the UK Vaccines Minister, Nadhim Zahawi. Vaccination teams saw 1% of the population of Wales on Friday and Saturday, Mr Gething said. The pace of the vaccination programme was welcomed by other main opposition leaders in Wales. But Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said the Welsh Government had been ""stuttering"" at the start of the rollout. ""I'd hoped that by shining a light on that slowness, and some of the comments of the first minister and the health minister, we've got where we are to today,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the increase in the vaccination rate was ""fantastic"". ""I think we should celebrate Welsh success,"" he said. ""It's down to everyone that has been part of this, and that includes the Welsh Government, should be congratulated for the improvement in the vaccination rate.""

Engelbert Humperdinck's wife dies with Covid,"Engelbert Humperdinck's wife Patricia has died after contracting Covid-19.  In a statement on Facebook, the singer said he was ""heartbroken"" over the loss of his ""darling wife"", who had had Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade. He added her ""battle with Alzheimer's was brave from the very beginning"" and she had ""she slipped softly away, as if by God's clockwork"". The couple married in 1964, after meeting at a nightclub in Leicester. Humperdinck, born Arnold George Dorsey, said his wife was surrounded by three of their four children, Louise, Jason and Brad, when she died on Friday, with their fourth, Scott, on video call. In a tribute to his wife, Humperdinck - who topped the UK singles chart with his hits Release Me and The Last Waltz in the 1960s - wrote: ""She never resisted as we tried to leave no stone unturned. ""We love you beyond words, forever and always... Goodnight my baby."" Humperdinck, who has a home in Great Glen, in Leicestershire, but is currently staying at his home in California, wrote in an earlier Facebook post on Thursday: ""Her Alzheimer's and the blow from Covid have left her in need of all the love she ever gave out to come back to her a million-fold."" The couple met in 1953 at Leicester's Palais De Danse nightclub when Patricia was 17. When Patricia was interviewed by the BBC several years ago about their first meeting, she said: ""The night that I saw Enge, it was just something different. ""He stood out because he had got this wonderful white suit on. ""I thought 'God, how gorgeous'. But he looked at me and smiled and I thought, 'He's conceited. He knows that I like him'. ""So he sent his friend over to ask me to dance. This guy said, 'My friend's a singer and he'd like to dance with you'. ""I said, 'Oh really? Why doesn't he ask me himself?' ""Eventually he did and we went on his friend's motorbike and that was the beginning of a wonderful romance."" Humperdinck had previously asked his fans to pray for their family after disclosing last month the virus had ""found a way"" into his home. His agent later said he had tested positive but was asymptomatic. Humperdinck also represented the UK at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2012 with the song Love Will Set You Free.

Probe into police 'punch' claims in cafe arrest,"Police are investigating a video showing a man ""who appears to be struck"" by an officer at a cafe where lockdown rules were suspected of being broken. Officers went to the cafe in Burnage, Manchester, on Sunday afternoon over claims it was packed with customers. The incident was captured on video as a 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of the assault of an emergency worker and resisting arrest. Police said 14 people were also fined. In the video, two police officers are seen entering the cafe on Burnage Lane surrounded by people not wearing masks. There is then a scuffle outside between a man and an officer in a fluorescent jacket. One man can be heard shouting at the officer: ""Why did you punch him?"" Greater Manchester Police said it was ""aware of a video circulating online involving a man who appears to be struck by a police officer"" which was being investigated. It said its officers were ""responding to reports of non-compliance with Covid-19 restrictions"". ""Officers attended and in line with procedure, attempted to engage with individuals and disperse attendees,"" a spokesman added. ""This resulted in an officer being assaulted.""

Scientists developing boosters to tackle variants,"Scientists are developing booster jabs to tackle Covid-19 variants, a health minister says, amid concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's efficacy against the South Africa strain. The vaccine provides good protection against the dominant 'Kent' variant in the UK. But a small study suggests it offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. Some 147 cases of this variant have been found in the UK. Health minister Edward Argar said the government was anticipating that an annual jab could be required to combat variants of coronavirus. He also said there was ""no evidence"" the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness from the South African variant, which scientists have warned could become more widespread in the UK. In South Africa, where the variant - known as 501.V2 or B.1.351 - accounts for 90% of new coronavirus cases in the country, the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been put on hold awaiting further advice. Early research suggests other vaccines are also likely to offer less protection against the South African variant than against the original virus. Mr Argar told BBC Breakfast that every study ""deserves to be taken very seriously"" but there was ""no evidence"" that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was not effective at preventing severe illness from coronavirus ""which is the key thing we are seeking to tackle"".  South Africa's suspension of the rollout of the vaccine was only ""temporary"" at this stage and the ""context is a little bit different"" to the UK where the Kent variant is the dominant strain, he said. Meanwhile, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said the public could have ""confidence"" in the UK's Covid vaccines which ""appear to work well"" against the dominant variants in the country. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Zahawi said: ""Our brilliant scientists and medical advisers are now working on the potential for new versions of existing vaccines to offer further protections against Covid variants."" He added: ""We need to be aware that even where a vaccine has reduced efficacy in preventing infection there may still be good efficacy against severe disease, hospitalisation, and death."" Dr Peter English, a consultant in communicable disease control, said he hoped to see the availability of new vaccines tailored to the South African variant ""within months"" as the technology was ""well-established"". Dr Mike Tildesley, an infectious disease expert who advises the government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""it's very possible"" the South Africa variant could already be quite widespread in the UK. The ""surge testing"" taking place in certain areas in England ""really needs to be effective"" to halt its spread, he said, but ""sadly we may be in a similar situation to the Kent variant"" which eventually spread across the whole country. He added there were ""significant implications"" if it was the case that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was less effective against the South Africa variant, as it may mean ""more restrictions might be needed for longer"". Viruses mutate - so what is happening is not surprising. The mutations seen in South Africa change the part of the virus that the vaccines target. It means all the vaccines that have been produced so far are likely to be affected in some way. Trials for Novavax and Janssen vaccines that were carried out in South Africa showed less effectiveness against this variant. Both are currently before the UK regulator. Therefore the news about the Oxford-AstraZeneca does not come out of the blue. The fact it now only has ""minimal"" effect according to reports is concerning - the other vaccines showed effectiveness in the region of 60% against the South African variant. But we should be careful about rushing to judgement. The study was small so there is only limited confidence in the findings. What is more, there is still hope the vaccine will prevent serious illness and hospitalisation. What this once again illustrates is the pandemic is not going to end with one Big Bang. Vaccines are likely to have to change to keep pace with the virus. Progress will be incremental. But vaccines are still the way out of this - and as things stand they remain very effective against the virus that is dominant in the UK. Additional ""surge"" testing is taking place in small areas of England including parts of Surrey, Bristol, London, Kent, Hertfordshire, Walsall, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire.  Positive cases will be analysed to see if they are caused by the South African variant with results coming back in around seven to 10 days, according to the director of public health in Worcestershire, Dr Kathryn Cobain. Prof Shabir Madhi, who led the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine trial in South Africa, told the Today programme there was ""still some hope"" the jab may perform well against the South Africa variant when it comes to protecting against severe disease. He said he was ""extrapolating"" that from the efficacy of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine which used ""similar technology"" and had similar immune effects. The new study of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines. Prof Sarah Gilbert, the vaccine's lead researcher, said a modified version of the jab designed to combat the South Africa variant was likely to be ready to use in the autumn.  Data on two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - appear to offer some protection. And early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant. It comes as:  Do you have confidence in the Covid vaccines?

Shakin' Stevens says jab is 'first step to hope',"Singer Shakin' Stevens has said receiving the coronavirus jab is ""the first step to hope"". The Cardiff-born rock 'n' roller, 72, whose real name is Michael Barratt, was given his first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, on Sunday. He described staff at the centre as ""brilliant, absolutely brilliant"". ""Shaky"" had a string of number ones in the 1980s including This Ole House, Oh Julie and Merry Christmas Everyone. He admitted to having a fear of needles, and said: ""I was nervous before I got there, but I was very impressed. ""There were a lot of people getting vaccinated, but it was all very organised and all working together - nice people who made us all feel very relaxed."" He described conspiracy theories about the vaccine as ""concerning and upsetting"" because they could put people's lives at risk, and advised anyone with worries to discuss them with their GP. Following his vaccination at Adams Park Stadium, he said he was ""relieved"".  ""It is the first step to hope and it had to be done to help get life back to normal,"" he said. The singer said he hoped the roll-out of the vaccination programme would lead to live performances restarting in the future. ""We have had tours cancelled. It's a terrible thing and we all wanted it to go away quicker,"" he said. ""So fingers crossed - you just have got to cope with the situation.  ""Keep your distance, wear your masks.""

Firm lands deal to make 20m lateral flow tests,"A firm has been given a government contract to make 20 million rapid lateral flow tests. Derby-based SureScreen Diagnostics said it was the first British company to have its tests validated in the lab by Public Health England.  The antigen kits can return a result in about 30 minutes, it added. The government recently announced more companies in England would be given the tests for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown. Almost all of the early testing for coronavirus was done with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which can take 48 hours to produce results. They are also highly sensitive, sometimes picking up remnants of the virus from people who are no longer infectious. Lateral flow tests are faster but much less sensitive. They are being used to identify more asymptomatic cases to boost the testing programme and reduce transmission. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited SureScreen Diagnostics as the deal was announced. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock said rapid lateral flow tests ""strengthen our national response to the virus significantly, helping us to identify the around one in three people who are asymptomatic and break chains of transmission in our workplaces and communities"".  He added: ""It is excellent to be working with a UK firm to deliver millions more of these rapid tests."" SureScreen Diagnostics said the deal would create up to 200 jobs at the company and across the wider supply chain. The tests have also been proven to detect the ""Kent"" variant of Covid-19, the firm added. Lateral flow tests are becoming more and more common as they are seen as key to allowing us to get on with our lives during this coronavirus crisis.  In Derbyshire, they set up a number of stations where people could do the lateral flow test and get their results in under an hour. As of last week, there had been 21,838 tests carried out, of which 304 positive tests were found.  That might seem a small percentage, but each case can be stopped in its tracks if people do the right thing after getting a positive result. With new variants of this disease being more infectious, these tests are a way to put out the small fires, before they become big ones and cause more suffering and deaths.

Fire service to help with vaccine roll-out,"Fire crews will be helping with the coronavirus vaccine roll out across some parts of Wales. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service is working with Hywel Dda University Health Board in Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. The health board has been looking for help to get people to and from mass vaccination centres. It aims to tackle challenges it has faced vaccinating about 20,000 people aged over 70. The announcement comes as figures show more than 600,000 people in the top priority groups have now been given their first doses of Covid vaccines in Wales. By the end of January, Hywel Dda had administered just under 50,000 first doses of the vaccine, accounting for 12.4% of the area's population. Chris Davies, chief fire officer for the fire service, said: ""Whilst we already collaborate with the Welsh Ambulance Service Trust, this opportunity allows us to expand our assistance further within the health arena.

Vaccine centres and schools closed due to snow,"Many Suffolk Covid-19 vaccine centres have been closed due to heavy snow. The mass vaccination hub at the Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich are shut, plus centres in Debenham, Haverhill, Stowmarket, Woodbridge and Bury St Edmunds. A Met Office amber warning was put in place across much of the region until 12:00 GMT - meaning travel disruption and power cuts were likely. More than 300 schools have been closed to all pupils as well as some roads. The Gainsborough Sports Centre site, which can vaccinate thousands of people each week and is primarily for people who live within a 45-minute drive of east Ipswich, is run by the Essex Partnership University NHS Trust, which said it would reopen on Thursday. It also said its centre at Chevington Close, Bury St Edmunds was closed on Monday. On Sunday, five vaccination sites run by the Suffolk GP Federation, at Trinity Park near Ipswich, Woodbridge Community Hall, Debenham Community Centre and The Mix in Stowmarket, closed at 12:00, while the EpiCentre in Haverhill shut at 16:00. The Federation said they would remain closed on Monday ""due to snowy conditions and for safety reasons"" and a decision had not yet been made about reopening on Tuesday. ""Site managers and booking team staff are notifying patients by text and phone, and are advising them about how to make a new appointment for the coming week,"" a statement said. The NHS West Suffolk Clinical Commissioning Group said it expected all the county's other vaccination sites to operate as usual, but it was possible that some may have to close early and patients should check before travelling. Under current national restrictions, only children of critical workers and vulnerable children have been attending school in person, but Suffolk County Council said ""the majority"" of its 300 primary schools, 90 secondary schools and 50 colleges and 6th forms were closed. The A140 was closed just before midnight with police saying several cars were abandoned by drivers - but it has since reopened. Debenham Road in Mickfield was also shut. Suffolk Highways tweeted that it had been working through the night to treat priority roads but were ""up against snowdrifts, stuck vehicles and impassable roads"". It said the B1115, north of Hitcham, had ""snowdrifts higher than our ploughs"" and had been asking farmers to help them clear the roads. Here is #B1115 just north of #Hitcham.

Barber and customers fined for haircut breaches,"A barber has been fined Â£1,000 and three customers Â£200 each for breaching the coronavirus lockdown. Durham County Council said its officers found the hair stylist operating in the county last week but has refused to say where. Joanne Waller from the council said the group were ""not only breaking the law"" but also putting ""safety at risk"". Durham Police said most people abide by the rules but those caught breaking them would be ""dealt with robustly"". The council has not identified the barber involved. Ms Waller, the council's head of community protection services, said: ""This case should serve as a reminder to businesses to continue to follow the current lockdown rules and government guidance.  ""By operating, you are not only breaking the law and could face a large fine, but you are putting your customers' safety at risk and in danger of being fined too. ""The more we follow the guidance, the sooner restrictions can be lifted and businesses can start to reopen.""

Covid is ‘creating a new genre’ for live music,"By Alex TaylorBBC entertainment reporter As an international touring DJ with an album to release, Hot Since 82's hectic schedule for 2020 didn't originally include playing from a hot air balloon.  Nor beneath the pier of a deserted Hartlepool beach - to a live audience of seagulls. But then he didn't originally plan on Covid unexpectedly unplugging nightlife as we knew it. By emptying stages and dancefloors, the pandemic has generated an urgent need to reimagine the live music experience - both for artists and the audience stuck at home.  So, how is Covid reshaping the creative thinking behind live music performances, and what lasting impact could there be? Hot Since 82's manager James Drummond says ""lockdown forced people to think differently"".  ""Our mindset's always been that way, so we saw it as a challenge,"" he says. ""We thought, well if everyone's at home and can't go to a venue - what's the best experience we can give them? The natural environment was our answer."" The pier and balloon sets - filled with vast landscapes and stunning drone shots, recognised the restrictions of the world, but also offered ""a different kind of adventure"" for music lovers, Drummond says. The sense of opportunity is shared by Alex Lill, the creative force behind The Weeknd's recent videos and live performances. ""Before the pandemic even hit we were trying to reimagine how we could provide a cinematic experience for the audience at home, not just the live audience,"" he tells the BBC. Last January's immersive performance of Heartless on the US's Late Show with Stephen Colbert demonstrated this.  Rather than rely on the traditional stage and live audience set-up, it followed The Weeknd backstage in single-shot as he performed through a surreal dream-like sequence, which ended with him arriving at the 'live' studio stage to greet the in-person audience.    ""When Covid started and live audiences were out the window, only then were we given more licence by various television networks and platforms to pursue this new approach"" says Lill. As audiences moved online, that new way of thinking - once seen as a curious experiment by execs - became a firm necessity. A summer livestream concert by Dua Lipa raised the bar for Covid-era production values, with a large and highly choreographed cast of dancers, guest singers and musicians performing in an old warehouse. Fast-forward to The Weeknd's medley performance of Save Your Tears/In Your Eyes at last November's American Music Awards, and the evolution is clear.  Made in the midst of the pandemic, Lill took the single-shot tracking style and moved it outside onto the bare streets of Los Angeles, transforming the real-world Covid backdrop into his stage. Complete with fireworks, timed pyrotechnics and high-angle shots, it made the location and its atmosphere an active part of the performance. The sense of innovation and The Weeknd's trademark use of face bandages - part of an anti-drink driving campaign and a comment on Hollywood - culminated with his Super Bowl half-time show on Sunday. Working within the limitations of the pandemic is a challenge that Oscar Sansom, creative director of Forest of Black studios, describes as the ""colliding of two worlds"".  ""The new world of filmed live performance since Covid is creatively very exciting as it is an almost entirely new genre,"" he says. For Sansom, the challenge is now about how to convey some of the ""energy and emotion"" of traditional live music by filming in new ways and locations. Take his work shooting Liam Gallagher aboard a barge as it floated down the River Thames last year. Filmed with London's lockdown skyline and landmarks in full view, it gave the rendition of his single All You're Dreaming Of an added poignancy after a year of loss. ""The show explored that, without an audience, the nature of a live show can evolve into something totally different,"" says Sansom. ""It's now so open, the circumstances invite an exciting sense of possibility."" This freedom has meant some live performances go in the other direction, using intimacy to both reflect and reject the pandemic and social distancing.   To close Biffy Clyro's pandemic gig, livestreamed without fans from Glasgow's famous Barrowland Ballroom in September, Sansom built a cube for the Scottish rock band to play inside. ""I saw it as a metaphor for the separation we were all feeling and that the band felt from their fans,"" he explains.   ""Inside the cube the band could see nothing but their own reflection, whilst the 'in person' audience [the camera operators] were kept at a distance by the glass. ""It felt reminiscent of the screens we have all become used to communicating through recently. It also created this moment in the show for where they were completely separated from everything and everyone else on the set. It was just them playing without any cameras or crew to distract them. It created this bubble of normality for a song."" That in turn had a direct impact on the tone of the performance, which became a release of pure frustration, says Sansom. ""With the camera so close, when Simon Neil [lead singer] screams those final lyrics with such energy and intensity that it gives me goosebumps every time I watch it,"" he says.  ""We capture the incredible raw energy of their live performances in a way that had never been seen before."" For her AMA performance of Therefore I Am, Billie Eilish worked on creating the illusion of increased space within the pandemic distancing constraints. Inviting the viewer to follow Eilish through a seemingly endless maze of corridors, it aimed to replicate the track's video, which tracked Eilish as she explored a deserted shopping mall. ""On the surface this looks like a simple solution for the performance but actually what it does is provide a playground of corridors in a confined stage setting,"" says Hollie Wright, lecturer in design for performance and stage management at Birmingham City University.   ""The cinematography plays with the idea of space to begin with, and provides an intimate setting for the audience. What's interesting is that it waits until the end to reveal all elements of the set in one shot. Many performance spaces have evolved to meet as audiences have moved online. London's Barbican is one such example. When the pandemic hit, its head of music, Huw Humphreys, worked to bring their scheduled Live from the Barbican programme online. Additional cameras were installed around the concert hall and stage to provide viewers with an experience that was familiar but fresh. ""The audience are treated to a real variety of shots and all sorts of angles that people wouldn't have seen at one of our concerts pre-pandemic"" he says. ""It's put a lot of our future plans into hyperspeed, but a challenge we've relished."" The advantages of moulding the traditional live experience for an online audience have already started to become clear.  ""In the future we want to have a full concert hall and an audience watching remotely as well, because this allows us to reach people internationally,"" says Humphreys.  Looking ahead to the creative legacy of the pandemic on live music performance, Sansom is similarly optimistic.   ""Dark times often seem to propagate some of the most exciting creative works,"" he says. ""I have no doubt that the current global situation will have a profound and lasting impact on both the music and creative industries, but I believe that creative people, by their nature, are adaptive.  ""I think the silver lining for me is seeing what incredible and inventive creations will arise from this unfortunate situation we all find ourselves in. ""I feel like we are at the start of something very exciting with virtual shows and that the creative journey will go beyond this pandemic."" Follow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.

'No deportation risk' for illegal migrants getting jab,"People living in the UK unlawfully won't be risking deportation by coming forward for a coronavirus jab, the government has said.   Ministers say they want everyone to get vaccinated and are urging illegal immigrants to register with a GP. The vaccine is free, regardless of a person's immigration status. However, the policy is not an amnesty for immigrants and no-one will be given leave to remain in the UK as a result of being vaccinated. When the coronavirus pandemic struck in the spring, the government announced that anyone seeking a test or treatment for coronavirus would not have their immigration status checked. It  is now being made explicit that this principle applies to vaccinations too.  And the government has said it will work with outside organisations to contact those who aren't yet registered with a GP. Responding to the news, the former minister, Conservative Julian Smith told the BBC's Westminster Hour: ""I welcome everybody, whoever they are, getting a jab."" Steve Valdez-Symonds from Amnesty UK said many undocumented immigrants are ""too afraid"" to access healthcare, adding that ""it has been the message, very clearly, from the government that access to health care is something that leads to information being passed about them to the immigration authorities"". ""It is great that the government has said it won't do that in this case, but it has an awful lot to do to ensure that people can believe in that."" He also said it was the case that ""many GP surgeries wrongly think people aren't allowed to register with them because of their immigration status, which is not true."" According to a National Audit Office report published last year the government has not had an up-to-date estimate of the number of immigrants in the UK illegally in 15 years - so it is not clear how many people this ruling affects. The last official estimate found about 430,000 people were in the country with no legal right to remain, but that figure dates back to 2005. And the NAO says independent research since then has put the number at over a million. More than 12 million people in the UK have now had at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine and the government is aiming to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February.

Covid fine for naked man found sitting in car,"Police have fined a man for breaching Covid regulations after he was found sitting naked in his car without a reasonable excuse. The man, who was parked in a car park in Derbyshire, claimed he had taken several wrong turns after making a journey to buy a pack of wet wipes. Police also fined another man who was sitting clothed in another vehicle in the same car park on Saturday. Derbyshire Police have told people they should only make essential journeys. They described the incident in a Facebook post titled ""Naked man found messing in a Mazda"". ""Naturally, officers challenged the nude male, asking him why he was in a closed car park,"" they wrote. ""However, the male was unable to provide a reasonable excuse of why he was stark naked in the car park during the height of a national lockdown."" The man was discovered by the Melbourne and Mercia Safer Neighbourhood Team, in a car park near Calke. Police said he did not have any mental health problems, and they also gave him a Community Protection Notice warning, insisting he wears clothes in public places. The same policing team also gave Â£200 fixed penalty notices to a ""courting couple"" who had a ""peck in a Peugeot"" at Staunton Harold Reservoir on Saturday. They said a man had travelled more than 100 miles from Lancashire to his girlfriend's home in Leicestershire, then picked her up and drove to the Derbyshire beauty spot. Police said ""their private moment was interrupted"" when officers challenged them. The couple were not in a support bubble, and this was not deemed to be essential travel, officers added. The team also posted about a couple who were found having a ""fumble in a Fiat"" at Mercia Marina. They pointed out the couple were ""not involved in essential exercise"" and were issued with fines.

Testing increase in hunt for South Africa variant,"Two test centres have opened in Worcestershire as the search continues for more cases of the South Africa variant of Covid-19. Surge testing began at the weekend after a case of the variant with no links to international travel was identified. A drive-through test centre opened on Monday at Sixways stadium, Worcester. The county's director of public health said it would take at least a week to uncover new cases of the variant. ""Any positive results go to the reference laboratories for testing so we will not know the presence of the South African variant for some seven to 10 days after we get the initial positive result,"" Dr Kathryn Cobain said. About 6,000 people need to be tested in parts of the WR3 and WR9 postcodes, according to Worcestershire County Council. The variant is not believed to be any more dangerous than others spreading in the UK but there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not be as effective against it. The first mobile unit started testing at The White Hart pub in Fernhill Heath over the weekend for adults with no symptoms living within walking distance. The local authority admitted early technical difficulties had forced it to cancel and rearrange some appointments with fewer than 200 people being tested on Saturday. Officials hope to test 500 on Monday at the new Sixways centre and a second mobile unit has been set up at the same pub. Meg Farmer, who lives in Fernhill Heath and sits on the parish council, said there had been ""hiccups"" at the weekend but ""things are settling down"". ""It is a worry because this South African variant of it has travelled around the country so quickly,"" she added. Door-to-door testing will be introduced later this week and the council said it would be contacting people classed as extremely vulnerable to arrange for them to get a test.

Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine,"By Nelli BirdBBC News ""I'd shout it from the street - please have your vaccinations, you don't know what we're going through."" This is a plea from Shamim Abbas of Newport, who lost husband Ghulam and brother-in-law Raza to Covid. The brothers died within hours of each other last April. Concerns have been growing in recent weeks about an apparent hesitancy from some people in black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) communities to have the Covid-19 vaccine.   And even though the virus has had such a devastating impact on Shamim's family, some relatives have been unsure about having it. ""My brother-in-law didn't want to have it done - he didn't want to let my mother-in-law have it done,"" she said. ""I had to calm him down and reassure him. People are scared. They are reading these reports and they are scared.  ""People seeing us now - for me and my daughters it's a living hell everyday. We miss him every minute of the day."" The reports that Shamim is talking about are myths or conspiracy theories that are posted online and on social media.  ""I think the problem is that whereas resources that combat this misinformation are available in English, they're not necessarily available in languages that some of these communities speak as a first language,"" explains Dr Bnar Talabani, a doctor specialising in kidney and transplant medicine at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. She is part of a group called Muslim Doctors Cymru, who are trying to dispel some of the myths circling on the internet. They are carrying out a survey asking people for their views on the vaccine - and although only 220 people have replied so far, the results paint a picture reflected in other polling on the issue. About 10% of people said they would not be taking the vaccine, with 16% unsure. ""These aren't anti-vaxxers, they are actually very, very open to dialogue,"" Dr Talabani said. ""One elderly gentleman I recently had a conversation with said to me 'well, does the vaccine change my DNA?' and I said 'Well, no, it cannot because it doesn't come into contact with your DNA'. ""And he said 'okay, well that was my only concern. I'm happy to have it now', and it was really that simple."" A similar conversation took place at the Cardiff Bay surgery in Grangetown, where Hassan Ahmed, 77, who moved to the UK from Yemen in 1977, was waiting to be vaccinated.  ""I heard people say the injection is bad for us, but you're the doctor, I don't know,"" he said. His GP, Dr Emaad Alauddin, chatted him through how the vaccine worked, reassuring him, and afterwards, Mr Ahmed described his happiness about receiving it. Dr Talabani said a problem within communities is that people receive misinformation in their own language via social media. ""If English is not your first language, you receive lots of misinformation via WhatsApp and other social media platforms in languages that are your first language, but the accurate information that is needed to combat this you don't necessarily have access to in that language,"" she said. Having that information accessible and readily available and actually using social media as a platform to spread it just as the misinformation is also being spread, so arming communities with accurate information in multiple languages will go a long way in helping address this."" She added it was important this information comes from a ""grassroots"" level as well as from the government, and to engage faith leaders. ""We are holding weekly webinars in different languages and people within different communities are actually engaging with us. ""We're having feedback that that dialogue, the possibility to ask questions about the vaccine in a language they're comfortable with, with people who are from their own community, is really helping them address those concerns."" At the end of January, analysis of patient data in England to the middle of the month found black people over the age of 80 were half as likely to have been vaccinated as those who were white. Public Health Wales said its data showing ethnic breakdown of vaccine take-up is not available yet. Chairman of Race Council Cymru Ray Singh believes it needs to be in the public domain now. ""If we had data, we would know how many black Asians have been vaccinated, say in area one and how many people live in that area, and then the communities leaders and others can start working on these with these people to persuade them,"" he said.  ""This is a race against time, a question of life and death.  ""The minister for vaccination for England admitted that there was disparity in England and I see no reason why we're not having the same, but we have no data."" Another idea to increase confidence in the vaccine is to try and use places like mosques as vaccination centres. The Dar-Ul-Isra mosque in Cardiff is one of those which has told the local health board that it would be happy to be used. ""We feel that as a mosque we are in the best position to dispel the myths - explain to people that there is no issue with taking the vaccine from a theological point of view but also from a health perspective,"" said Naveed Rahman, an administrator for the mosque.   ""I think people just coming to the mosque and knowing they are taking the vaccine in the mosque will be a big part of that."" Public Health Wales recognised ""the importance of ensuring equitable access to and uptake"" of vaccinations. It said it was examining data and other information, including ethnicity, to see who in what groups had been vaccinated. ""It will be shared with colleagues working to implement the vaccination programme in local areas to help identify areas in the local community where uptake of the vaccine is not as high as we would like,"" a spokesman said. ""We encourage everyone to have the vaccine when they are offered it, whatever their background."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething quoted Office for National Statistics figures showing men from black African backgrounds and women from black Caribbean backgrounds had the highest death rates for their sex but added Covid was having a disproportionate impact on all black, Asian and minority ethnic communities. He said: ""We need to dispel misinformation and unite as a country to protect those we care about the most, from this deadly virus.  ""I want to make it abundantly clear to all, the vaccine contains no pork products or traces of foetal matter and is safe for all ethnic minority and faith communities. "" How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine?

Mass testing offered in town despite case decrease,"Health officials say they hope Covid cases in a Scots town can be driven down further by mass testing. Stranraer and the surrounding area saw a spike in numbers around Christmas which was described as Dumfries and Galloway's most serious outbreak. The region's health partnership said numbers had ""declined significantly"" over the past month. However, it added that by offering tests to people without symptoms it hoped cases could reduce even further. Dumfries and Galloway Health and Social Care Partnership issued a first warning about a new, more transmissible strain of Covid in the area just before Christmas. Numbers rose rapidly after that with a number of deaths reported at a care home in the town. Daily testing has been offered in the town for some time but is now being extended to people without obvious symptoms in the DG8 and DG9 postcode areas. Interim director of public health Valerie White said: ""Testing of people both with and without Covid symptoms is something we're likely to see becoming more commonplace in Scotland. ""Trials have taken place on smaller scales, with a unit which recently ran tests over four days in Langholm and Canonbie having undertaken just two previous trials in Scotland."" She said rates had reduced in Wigtownshire thanks to the ""efforts and sacrifices"" made by people in response to the high rates attributed to the new strain. ""Daily testing was instituted in Wigtownshire just before the end of last year in response to that spike in cases, but only for people with symptoms of the coronavirus,"" she said. ""Although rates have fallen, access to testing for people without symptoms will hopefully mean that additional, undetected cases in the community can be picked up and the presence of the virus driven down further. ""It is very important that if you have symptoms of coronavirus you immediately self isolate with your household and book a test. ""If you do not have symptoms of coronavirus you do not need to self isolate prior to your test."" She stressed that even if a test proved negative it was ""critical"" that people continued to follow all guidance and ""abide by the current rules"".

NHS dental patients 'asked to pay private fees',"Some NHS dental patients have been asked to pay for private care ""if they want any treatment"", according to a watchdog. Others are facing waits of up to two years for an NHS appointment, Healthwatch England has warned. One patient was in so much pain he decided to extract his own teeth, said its chairman Sir Robert Francis. The NHS said over 650 urgent dental hubs have been set up so patients can access a dentist. Hundreds of people contacted Healthwatch England between October and December last year complaining about dentistry issues. A briefing document from the watchdog said that ""a lack of NHS dentist appointments"" remains the most common issue - with people asked to wait for up to two years. The paper also said that patients have ""indicated that dentists have prioritised private care or asked them to pay private fees if they wanted any treatment"". One patient was offered a procedure for Â£1,700 which was Â£60 on the NHS, according to the document. Another was told to use a nail file to deal with a broken tooth, and others were advised to ""buy dental repair kits and treat themselves"". Claire Westwood, from Grange-over-Sands in Cumbria, was prescribed antibiotics for a tooth infection after seeing her local dentist. She went back afterwards as she was still in pain and was told by the surgery she would need root canal treatment. ""The cost of this would be over Â£900 and I wouldn't be able to get it as a NHS patient due to the fact they're no longer accepting them and there would be a waiting list,"" Ms Westwood told Radio 4's Today programme. ""It's very worrying and frustrating that I don't know where to go forward form here. It will only get worse again if it's not treated soon and the only option to have it treated soon is to pay privately."" The industry has been badly affected by the coronavirus pandemic after being forced to shut for several weeks during lockdown last year - which has led to huge backlogs.  Social distancing, infection control and personal protective equipment has also meant that dentists have not been able to see as many patients as they used to. Sir Robert said the issues highlighted by Healthwatch England show how the coronavirus pandemic has ""exacerbated the human impact of years of structural issues in NHS dentistry and is now pushing it to crisis point"". Dentists have been ordered to reach 45% of their pre-pandemic levels - but they have raised concerns about seeing further patients given the recent spike in Covid infections. Healthwatch England has called on the  government, the NHS and the dental profession to work with patients to fix systemic issues in dental care. ""All efforts should be made to treat those in need of urgent care and provide more accurate and up-to-date information to help people find and access NHS dental care,"" said Sir Robert. ""In the longer term, the Department of Health and Social Care must prioritise the importance of oral health and commit to improving access to dentistry for everyone who needs it."" Shawn Charlwood, chair of the British Dental Association's General Dental Practice Committee, said the government was ""forcing dentists to prioritise volume over need by imposing inappropriate targets"". ""We need government to adopt a pragmatic approach, which keeps practices afloat and ensures those who need dental care the most can secure it."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it was working closely with the NHS to increase access to dentistry services ""as fast as possible, while protecting staff and patients from Covid-19 infection"". An NHS spokeswoman said: ""It's right that the NHS has set targets that help patients see their dentist, with many practices already going well beyond the target set.  ""Despite the pandemic, millions of people received dental treatment last year and the NHS has set up over 650 urgent dental hubs so patients can get access to a dentist if they need it.""

South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk?,"By Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Coronavirus has been changing in ways that might help it escape some of the body's immune system defences.  Scientists are working to update the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, as research suggests it - and other coronavirus vaccines - may be less effective against the South Africa variant. The ones being used now should still protect against severe illness, however. All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants. These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive.  Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans.  There are now many thousands of variants of the pandemic virus circulating. But experts are concerned about the South African variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351. There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people who become infected. As with the original version, the risk is highest for people who are elderly or have significant underlying health conditions. But there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it.  Some of the changes involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations. The South African variant carries a mutation, called N501Y, that appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread.  Another mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system and may affect how well coronavirus vaccines work.  It is too soon to say for sure, or by how much, until more tests are completed, although it is extremely unlikely the mutations would render vaccines useless.  Scientists have tested the Pfizer Covid vaccine against N501Y and E484k mutations in the lab, using blood samples from vaccinated people. In that study, vaccination appeared to work, but was slightly less effective.  Early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or prolonged.  Two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - appear to offer some protection against the variant.  Preliminary work suggests the Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine offers ""limited"" protection against mild disease from the South Africa variant, but experts say it should still protect against severe disease.  Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary. It is already the dominant virus variant in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces of South Africa.  At least 20 other countries including Austria, Norway and Japan, have also found cases. In the UK, 147 cases of the variant have been found, with extra testing in the areas of England affected. Travel is now banned from many countries in southern Africa, as well as Tanzania and Democratic Republic of Congo. Targeted testing in the community is also taking place in some parts of England.  Public health authorities and scientists are studying the variant and will share their findings soon.

Coronavirus: Morning update,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Monday morning. We'll have another update for you this evening. The public should have ""confidence"" in the UK vaccination programme, the vaccines minister says - despite a study showing the AstraZeneca jab may be less effective against the South African variant of Covid-19. The study involved about 2,000 people, with an average age of 31. It showed the jab offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease from the South African variant. AstraZeneca said it did not know whether the jab would stop severe illness, because the study was predominantly on younger people. But the company said it could still be effective. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says the jabs ""appear to work well"" against the variants currently dominant in the UK. On Sunday, he told the BBC that a booster in the autumn, and annual vaccines, could be needed to combat variants. He also ruled out ""vaccine passports"" for people to travel - watch the clip below.  South Africa has responded to the study by pausing the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine. The country has received 1m doses of the AstraZeneca jab and was due to start vaccinating people next week. The government will still offer vaccines produced by Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer in the coming weeks. Watch our explainer on how vaccines are approved below. Labour is challenging the government to ""clean up"" how it awards contracts for Covid work. In a speech on Monday, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves will say procurement during the pandemic has been ""rife with conflicts of interest"". She will call for a new ethics watchdog to ""guarantee standards"" for spending public money. The government said it has ""robust rules"" to ensure that conflicts of interest do not occur.

Covid group founder is 'inspirational young man',"By Miles DavisBBC News Online On the evening of his father's funeral Liam Meyer launched a group to help other families whose lives had been ravaged by Covid-19. His father, David, died with Covid-19 aged 62 on 29 March 2020 leaving Mr Meyer, his mother and four older sisters. As he came to terms with the difficulty of dealing with grief in isolation in the middle of a pandemic, he resolved to do something to help other people. His response to personal tragedy was to set up the support group Alone Together which has now grown to about 700 members around the UK and internationally. The group is seen as a ""lifeline"" to people dealing with the death of loved ones and Liam has been hailed as ""absolutely inspirational"" by its members. Describing the moment when he learned of his father's death in hospital, Mr Meyer said: ""As soon as I put the phone down from speaking to my mum my legs just gave way."" Mr Meyer, 36, from Newton Abbot in Devon, said he enjoyed a close relationship with his father, a mechanic who taught his only son about cars and took him fishing. ""I don't believe in putting people on a pedestal,"" he said. ""But I always looked up to him and now I feel a bit lost."" Mr Meyer felt his father was ""not honoured in the way he should have been"" at a socially-distanced funeral on 6 April with only eight other family members. Thinking about other bereaved people who might not have the same family support network Mr Meyer enjoyed was what drove him to launch the support group on Facebook. ""I wanted people not to feel alone, not to feel isolated and to know that other people cared,"" he said. The group has grown in strength and number over the past 10 months - every new member a reminder of the rising number of deaths. Mr Meyer said: ""People join when they are struggling and they plough through that and then offer advice to new people. ""They then take great strength in being able to help others."" After appearing on Gareth Malone's BBC 2 programme Singing For Britain, Mr Meyer set up the Alone Together choir in June and the group recorded the song Thank You in memory of their loved ones. ""Friendships are being made between people who would not normally speak or meet,"" he said. ""We're all sticking together."" Julia Abbitt, from Par in Cornwall, lost her father, Alan St. John-Cooke to Covid-19 in the early hours of Easter Sunday, 12 April 2020, at the Medway Maritime Hospital in Kent. He had celebrated his 60th wedding anniversary with his wife Joan just more than two weeks earlier on 26 March. Mrs Abbitt said her father, who died aged 88, was a ""soft-spoken, old school gentleman"" who had served in the RAF during his National Service before a career in the oil industry. Having driven from Cornwall to visit her father in hospital in Kent she was sleeping in her car on her parent's driveway when she took the call from the hospital to say her father had died. She said: ""My dad was my hero and was always there for me."" Mrs Abbitt saw a story on BBC Spotlight about Liam Meyer setting up the Alone Together group and got in touch. She said: ""There is empathy and compassion and we all understand what each other is going through."" Mrs Abbitt also joined the Alone Together choir and said singing with others has been ""healing"". She said: ""I'd tell the world about my dad if I could. I don't want him to be forgotten."" Ouida Wickramaratne's son Daniel died with Covid-19 aged 17 on 10 April 2020. ""I was holding his hand and telling him I loved him and said goodbye,"" she said. Mrs Wickramaratne, from New Malden, in London, said her son ""lived 17 years of an amazing life"". Daniel had cerebral palsy and could not speak but communicated ""with his eyes and laughter and his smile"". His mother said: ""I was his voice in life and now I want to be his voice after his death."" Mrs Wickramaratne said she was ""so vulnerable"" after Daniel's death but the Alone Together group ""was a lifeline"". ""The key to unlocking grief is talking about it,"" she said. Being a part of the Alone Together choir has also made Mrs Wickramaratne realise that ""we're not alone - we're together in this"". She said: ""Just talking about how I feel with people who have gone through the same experience has been a massive help."" Fiona Drummond's father, Gilbert, died aged 85 in Glasgow on 5 April 2020 with Covid-19. ""I miss him terribly every day,"" she said. ""He was the head of the family and if ever I was in trouble he was always the person I would go to."" Mrs Drummond, from Glasgow, said her father, an engineer, was a ""larger than life character"" who was ""resilient and strong"" but would also make people laugh.

Scots business confidence 'soars despite downturn',"Scottish private sector confidence has climbed to its highest level for nearly seven years despite a sharp drop in output last month, a survey has found. The latest Royal Bank of Scotland PMI indicated stricter lockdown rules ""stifled"" demand in January. That led to steep drops in both activity and new business for firms. But the survey found optimism rose on the back of the Covid vaccine rollout, as well as hopes of looser restrictions and a solid economic recovery. January was a particularly poor month for business activity north of the border, with Scotland seeing the steepest drop in output of goods and services of any monitored area of the UK. The bank's business activity index, which measures combined manufacturing and service sector output, posted 33.3 in January, down from 47.3 in December.  Excluding the period between March and May last year, the latest reading was the lowest on record.  Scotland also registered the quickest drop in new work across 12 UK areas. Respondents attributed that fall to stricter Covid-related measures, which the bank said ""stymied"" client demand. Meanwhile, companies reported making further cuts to staff numbers, with service providers seeing more widespread reductions than manufacturers. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said: ""Stricter lockdown measures took a toll on the Scottish private sector during January, with the downturn worsening amid steep drops in both activity and new business. ""The falls remained slower than at the height of the first lockdown last spring, perhaps reflective of companies adapting to restrictions, but were still severe."" He added: ""Positive news again came from business confidence, which was the strongest since April 2014 amid hopes of an economic recovery once restrictions are lifted.  ""Conditions will remain very challenging in the meantime, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel for Scotland's economy as the vaccine rollout progresses and measures are loosened.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-55940042,1
'My lockdown business is my anxiety therapy',"By Alex PopeBBC News, East A mother-of-two who turned her sewing hobby into a lockdown business said it has become a ""coping mechanism"" to improve her mental health. Emma Talbot, 39, from Bedford, started Clemency Loves Jude from her kitchen table to help with post-natal anxiety and panic attacks caused by lockdowns. Unable to buy new clothes, she adapted her wardrobe and began making headbands with the leftover material. ""I find it incredibly therapeutic being creative,"" she said.  ""During the first lockdown in March, I was experiencing panic attacks, feeling anxious and not sleeping well as I was dealing with post-natal and pandemic anxiety,"" she said.  To help her mental health, she ran and in the evenings ""distracted myself by sewing or customising clothes"". She was already on prescribed medication and was seeing a counsellor, but found the hobby also helped her.  ""With two young kids it's unpredictable - it's about having the coping mechanism,"" she said. ""As I wear hairbands, I wanted to make one without any glue - just handmade and sewn - so I created and made my own template."" Keen to make her online business ""sustainable and eco friendly"", she sourced material from old clothes, charity shops, Ebay, and family and friends. She sells her products through social media channels and weekly orders are in the double-digits. ""Sewing in the evening is my way of winding down and to take my head away from the news,"" she added. ""It's a business, a hobby and a therapy."" Clemency Loves Jude was founded in November and has ""helped financially"" after a two-year period which included maternity leave, sick pay and furlough from her role with Bedford Blues Rugby Club. Figures from the Office of National Statistics show more people have reported symptoms of depression since the pandemic began. The Bedfordshire, Luton and Milton Keynes Clinical Commissioning Groups (BLMK CCG) said: ""Covid 19 has had a significant impact on people's mental wellbeing.

Pandemic causes 'marginal' delay to £750m Metro,"By Brian MeechanBBC Wales business correspondent The rollout of a Â£750m integrated public transport network across south Wales faces a ""marginal"" delay due to the coronavirus crisis, its boss says. James Price of Transport for Wales (TfW) said the South Wales Metro project, set to be completed in 2023, will be delayed for ""months not years"". He said work on lines, funded by the Welsh Government and European Union, had already started. It comes as TfW is nationalised after a drop in passenger numbers during Covid. The Welsh Government has taken control two-and-a-half years after KeolisAmey won the Â£5bn Wales and Borders franchise contract. Ministers have spent Â£167m to keep TfW afloat due to a loss of revenue during the pandemic. The government-owned organisation will now take on the day-to-day running of services - which are currently only used by passengers whose journey is ""essential"". ""The good news is that the Metro has been secured through government and EU funding and that continues,"" said Mr Price, TfW's chief executive. South Wales' inspiration is what happens in London - an integrated public transport network. The idea is passengers can use the same ticket or travel card across south Wales and the old Valleys Lines network using rail, tram and bus services - with Cardiff as the focal hub. Metro bosses have promised reduced journey times, greater passenger capacity on trains, more frequent and reliable services and better connections. TfW took ownership of much of the Valley Lines infrastructure from Network Rail in March 2020 as they worked towards a 2023 completion date - then Covid hit and lockdowns have affected progress. Work on upgrading track in ""preparation for electrification"" north of Cardiff started this year but the timeline has been hit. ""So the Metro work continues the new trains are on order as well so all the new trains are locked in,""said Mr Price. ""People will see that there's been a marginal delay to timelines. I can't exactly say what that delay is yet because Covid obviously hasn't completely finished."" The drop in passenger numbers and fall in income due to Covid has been so significant that KeolisAmey has been bailed out by the Welsh taxpayer as a ""last resort"" The company said last autumn it could not run the service as Covid meant the contract was no longer viable. It will continue to be involved in infrastructure, including upgrading the lines and trains. However, no-one - not even TfW - knows what the long-term impact of Covid on rail travel will be.  Will people working from home because of coronavirus want to return to the office? Or are they happy working from their kitchen table? ""We think that whilst there'll be a short-term implication... certainly the times a day that people travel and some of the patterns will change, the fundamental need is still there and the demand will come back,"" Mr Price said. The Welsh Government has said it wants 30% of people to work from home long-term but it will be for businesses and workers to decide on that. Sustrans Cymru, a charity that encourages walking and cycling, thinks a good public transport system will still be ""essential"" after the pandemic. ""People going forward want to have a blended approach,"" director Christine Boston said. ""Nobody wants to work from home on their own for evermore and I think we've always needed to encourage people where possible to work more local. Sustrans feels the public transport network will be needed to take the pressure off the congested road network at peak times, especially on the M4 motorway and A470. ""We need people to work differently to create more space on public transport, so more people can travel more sustainably,"" added Ms Boston. ""There are lots of jobs that can't be done from home, there are lots of people who still want to go to a place of work when they can - it just means that fewer people will be forced to make those journeys every day at peak time.

Oil prices climb back to pre-pandemic levels,"By Justin HarperBusiness reporter, BBC News The price of oil has recovered to its pre-pandemic levels having hit an all-time low last year. While demand for oil is still lower than normal, there are hopes of a speedier than expected economic recovery as vaccines are rolled out. Oil prices are often seen as a barometer for economic activity, still struggling with the virus downturn. ""Black gold"" has now reached $60 a barrel having risen more than 50% in the last few months. Brent crude, the major benchmark for oil, has seen strong growth recently. Futures contracts, which are based on the price of future delivery, have jumped 59% since November. West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the benchmark for US oil, last week rose above $55 a barrel for the first time in over a year. ""The biggest driver for the latest surge in prices seen through last week was a sharp upturn in expectations for economic and oil demand recovery on signs that the coronavirus may finally be in retreat,"" Vandana Hari, founder of Singapore-based oil markets data firm Vanda Insights told the BBC. Demand has been rising in parts of the world, particularly Asia. ""We are quite optimistic about what it is that we are seeing in China,"" Royal Dutch Shell chief executive Ben van Beurden said last week. Other factors have also played their part to push up prices such as efforts by oil-producing nations, particularly Saudi Arabia, to limit output. Since agreeing to the cut in production last April, producers have held back a cumulative 2.1 billion barrels of oil, leading to decreasing stockpiles. The coronavirus crisis has been devastating for the petroleum industry, and last year prices slumped below zero with more than one billion surplus barrels. Demand for fuel from airlines has seen the most dramatic fall as travel curbs remain in place. Air passenger traffic is 70% below year-ago levels, according to the International Air Transport Association. But demand has picked up in other areas, thanks in part to the shift to working and consuming more from home. As consumers are buying more online, this has spurred demand for fuel to power delivery trucks and vans, along with cargo ships and and freight trains. The e-commerce boom has also caused a spike for plastic packaging, which is made using oil products. However, oil demand is still lower than pre-pandemic levels and a slow economic recovery would delay a full rebound in world energy demand for years to come, the International Energy Agency warned last month.  ""There could be more setbacks in the spread of the virus or the vaccinations, causing a pullback in prices, though short of another crisis,"" added Ms Hari.

"'I've blocked 10,000 abusive social media accounts'","By Michael BaggsNewsbeat reporter ""I'd say at worst I was receiving 100 death threats a day online,"" Phoebe Jameson tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""I have nearly 10,000 accounts blocked."" We've all struggled over the past year, going in and out of lockdown, but for 19-year-old Phoebe there's been no escape online. She was first trolled after posting body positive photos and messages on social media. And she reckons the pandemic made things worse. A photo Phoebe posted to mark International Women's Day in March last year sparked a torrent of abuse and attracted ""hundreds of comments"" about how she looked. ""This kept happening across the whole of 2020. It got to the point where from July, I have not had a week's break from any online abuse.  ""In these last couple of months, it's been every single day, there will be something or some incident or some comment."" Phoebe has been reporting abusive posts and blocking accounts that were sharing them. Half of women and non-binary people polled by online abuse charity Glitch and the End Violence Against Women Coalition say they've experienced online abuse since the pandemic began. And a poll of 2,000 people for the National Children's Bureau, which was published in November 2020, suggests that more people were experiencing and reporting online abuse as bullying in schools decreased - because most people were learning from home. Phoebe says comments and DMs led to her making a suicide attempt in December. ""It got to the point where the comments made me feel like I couldn't be here anymore, really. I ended up in hospital."" When she later posted about her suicide attempt online she received more abuse. ""It was horrific. I just logged off for the rest of Christmas and New Year to just enjoy it and not think about what's being said online,"" she says. ""I'm not in that place now, but I can't say I'm not going to be in that place again from trolling because, I didn't think that would ever happen to me, I never thought it would reach that point."" Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate. He says there has been an ""industrial level of trolling"" during the coronavirus pandemic, and part of this has included online bullying. ""Right now we are primed to think of things that aren't like us as being dangerous,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Think about literally what Covid is - someone you love could kill you, just by coming near you.  ""So we're primed to think, I don't want to see people, I don't want to get too close. We are in a hyper-disgust phase."" He says people who troll others online don't get a thrill from the abuse they send, but from seeing the reaction from their victim. ""If you give them what they want and show anger and pain that incentivises them to gain that pleasure again. ""By taking away the possibility of gaining that pleasure, by blocking them, they'll stop."" He also says defending someone against trolls can sometimes do more harm than good because you ""rebroadcast, compound and worsen the abuse."" He says blocking and reporting abusive posts and accounts is still our best option, but also to remember that extreme cases may be against the law. When Phoebe reported the death threats to her local police, they recommended she log off social media. She did that in the short term for her mental health, but it isn't something she wants to do permanently. ""This is becoming part of my life more especially  because we're all virtual now,"" Phoebe says. ""I don't want to have to censor myself, I think that's the other thing. I tried to be a positive person for others and for my teenage self. I'm trying to be the woman that my teenage self never had. ""It gets tough but I don't feel like I should have to step away because some people don't want me to be existing in that space."" Avon and Somerset police, who Phoebe reported her situation to, says on its website that its officers will deal with online abuse only in the most extreme cases. These include a threat to someone's life, targeting specific individuals and persistent harassment and ongoing abuse. Phoebe's decided not to pursue matters with the police. But she does want social media companies to make it harder to set up fake account on their platforms - which is where a lot of the abuse she experienced came from. She's set up an organisation called The Speak Up Space, where victims of sexual violence and harassment can share their stories and look for help and advice. And despite the abuse she receives, still feels like the positives of being social media outweigh the negatives. ""It was nice when I had a break, I just stuck to WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends and it felt like a weight lifted. But I also love the community I'm in and I love all these friends I've made and all these people who reach out to me and say these lovely things,"" she says. ""I don't want to be pushed out or something. And if I choose to leave, that's going to be my decision. ""We're all going through this at the moment, and of course, everyone's reaction is going to be different to the pandemic, but being abusive to people online is not a viable response.""

Oxford jab offers less S Africa Covid protection,"Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant, scientists say early trials suggest. A new study, not yet peer reviewed, involved about 2,000 people who were on average 31 years old. But Prof Sarah Gilbert, Oxford lead vaccine developer, said vaccines should still protect against severe disease. She said developers were likely to have a modified Oxford jab by the autumn to combat the South Africa variant. South Africa has said it is putting its rollout of the Oxford vaccine on temporary hold, while scientists advise on the best way to proceed following the results of the study. The variant, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, is already the dominant virus variant in large parts of South Africa. Earlier, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr that a booster in the autumn and annual vaccines could be required to combat variants. More than 100 cases of the South Africa variant have been found in the UK.  A study outlining early trials, first reported by the Financial Times, suggests the vaccine offered ""minimal protection"" against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant, the University of Oxford said. Prof Gilbert told the Andrew Marr Show current vaccines ""have a reduction in efficacy against some of the variant viruses"". ""What that is looking like is that we may not be reducing the total number of cases but there's still protection in that case against deaths, hospitalisations and severe disease."" She added: ""That's really important for healthcare systems, even if we are having mild and asymptomatic infections, to prevent people going into hospital with Covid would have a major effect."" Meanwhile, Mr Zahawi said the UK government had ruled out issuing so-called ""vaccine passports"" to enable people who have had the jab against coronavirus to travel abroad. This isn't a complete surprise.  The mutation involved - known as E484K - seems to help the virus dodge immunity built up to previous variants and current vaccines. Real world trials of two other vaccines (Janssen and Novavax) showed a dip in performance in South Africa too. This is the same mutation that has also appeared in some cases of the ""Kent variant"" in the UK.  We are still waiting for scientists to publish their report in order to find out what ""limited"" means in hard numbers.  If people are still getting sick, even if it's mild, then they can spread the virus and that will make it harder to get on top of cases.   If the Oxford vaccine can prevent severe disease, and AstraZeneca thinks it will, then it would still be a life-saving vaccine. But it is clear coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change vaccines in the future to keep up. In a separate statement, AstraZeneca said the jab offered ""limited"" protection against mild and moderate disease caused by the variant. A spokesman for the pharmaceutical company said it had not yet been able to properly establish whether the jab would prevent severe disease and hospitalisation caused by the South Africa variant because those involved in the study had predominantly been young, healthy adults. But the company expressed confidence the vaccine would offer protection against serious cases, because it created neutralising antibodies similar to those of other coronavirus vaccines. The study, which assessed a two-dose regimen, is due to be published on Monday. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: ""This study confirms that the pandemic coronavirus will find ways to continue to spread in vaccinated populations, as expected, but, taken with the promising results from other studies in South Africa using a similar viral vector, vaccines may continue to ease the toll on health care systems by preventing severe disease."" In a news conference on Sunday, Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, said the study had been ""largely disappointing"" in terms of the jab's efficacy against the South Africa variant.  ""Unfortunately, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not work against mild and moderate illness,"" he said, adding that the data did not say whether or not the vaccine might still protect at least against severe infections. Earlier, Prof Madhi said a vaccine developed by Janssen showed it stopped moderate to severe disease, rather than all disease, and this kept people out of hospital. ""These findings recalibrate thinking about how to approach the pandemic virus and shift the focus from the goal of herd immunity against transmission to the protection of all at-risk individuals in population against severe disease,"" Prof Madhi added. On Saturday, AstraZeneca said its vaccine provided good protection against the variant first discovered in Kent, which is now dominant in the UK.  Early results suggest the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine protects against the new variants. Data on two new coronavirus vaccines that could be approved soon - one from Novavax and another from Janssen - appear to offer some protection. And early results from Moderna suggest its vaccine is still effective against the South Africa variant. Experts say vaccines could be redesigned and tweaked to be a better match for new variants in a matter of weeks or months if necessary.

NI records nine more Covid-19 related deaths,"A further nine Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. The department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 1,931. The latest figures, released on Sunday, also recorded 334 new positive cases of the virus. There are 585 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland, with 66 of those patients being treated in intensive care units (ICU). Of those in ICU, 57 are ventilated. In the Republic of Ireland, 12 further Covid-related deaths have been reported and there have been 1,024 new cases of the virus. Of those being treated in hospital, 178 are in intensive care. On Friday, Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann has warned against complacency as the number of people vaccinated against Covid-19 passed 275,000.

Scotland aims to vaccinate all adults 'in summer',"Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has said her ambition is to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that it was ""not sensible"" to give specific dates as it depends on supplies remaining unhindered. On Sunday a further seven deaths were recorded as well as 584 new cases. Official figures also showed 839,266 people had received the first dose of the Covid vaccination - a record increase of 52,839 on Saturday. In total, 94% of over-80s have now had a jab. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Scotland was ""on track to hit all targets"" after a record day of vaccinations. Once all the priority groups outlined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have been completed, Scotland's vaccine deployment plan moves on to the rest of the population. Ms Freeman said: ""Our ambition is to get through all those 4.5m adults, 18 and over, in the summer. ""At this point it is not very sensible to give specific dates because there are a number of unknowns, partly what the JCVI tell us and partly about supplies. ""But what is the case, is that our infrastructure to do that is there, and we have the vaccinators, we have the support staff, we have the local and the regional centres able to do it.  ""As fast as we get supplies we will be vaccinating."" Ms Freeman warned that Scotland must remain ""cautious"" about the new Covid variants but stressed that the current vaccines are ""very effective"". A record 52,839 vaccinations in ð´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ yesterday ð839,226 have now had first dose, inc 99.5% of older care home residents, 90% of staff in older adult care homes, 94%+ of over 80s living in community, 64% of those aged 75-79 and 26% of 70-74 yr olds. On track to hit all targets. The latest Scottish government data showed 108 people were in intensive care with recently confirmed Covid, nine less than Saturday. Hospital numbers were also down by 19, to 1,710. But the test positivity rate had increased from 5.9% to 6.9% since Saturday. The health secretary also told the programme that discussions are still ongoing on how hotel quarantine for people arriving in Scotland from abroad will work.  She would not comment on whether hotel rooms have been booked for the new ""managed quarantine"" policy - due to come into force on 15 February. While the UK government will only require those arriving from ""red list"" countries to quarantine in a hotel, Scotland will require all international travellers to do so, regardless of where they have come from. Meanwhile, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said the UK must remain alert for new strains of Covid. His comments come after early trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab suggested it gives limited protection against mild disease caused by the South Africa variant. AstraZeneca also said it had not yet determined whether the vaccine protects against severe disease caused by this variant. Mr Wallace told The Sunday Show: ""We have to be aware that the lessons we have learned from the past year are not something to be put on a shelf and forgotten. ""This will be an ongoing challenge to the world, how we deal with Covid. ""There is no such thing as a magic wand, this is about managing outbreaks, managing infections and making sure that we constantly develop our vaccines.""

Over 12 million in UK have had first Covid jab,"More than 12 million people in the UK have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, after 550,000 first jabs were given out on Saturday. The government is aiming to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. At the current rate, about 16 million people would receive a first jab by that date. The UK's daily Covid cases continue to fall, but remain high - with another 15,845 reported on Sunday. Another 373 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data also showed. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The update on vaccine progress comes as scientists say early trials suggest Oxford-AstraZeneca's jab offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. Meanwhile, workplace Covid testing is being offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. The speedy rollout of Covid vaccines to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS. Once the first four priority groups, including the over-70s, healthcare workers and people shielding, have received their jabs, the programme will move on to people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions. From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population, another 21 million people. Teachers, transport workers, supermarket workers and the military could be prioritised. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each offer their own advice on testing. On Sunday, Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said her ambition was to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had previously set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and a second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. In other developments:  Will I get side effects from the vaccine?

Has US finally turned the corner on Covid?,"By Mike HillsBBC News Visual Journalism It's been a long winter for the US, with hospitals seeing more coronavirus patients than at any point in the pandemic and the average number of daily deaths topping 3,000 for the first time. But as spring approaches, the number of infections is now falling and the vaccination programme looks to have overcome some of its initial problems.  So is the US on track to get back to some form of normality in 2021 or do new variants of the virus mean further setbacks are ahead? We've taken a look at the data and spoken to an epidemiologist to assess the situation.  The average number of daily cases in the US had been rising since September - apart from a few dips due to incomplete data over holiday periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas.  But as you can see from the chart below, daily cases have now been falling since early January. There are, however, still more than 120,000 new infections every day on average and it's unclear whether the recent decline will continue - especially now the US has cases of the more highly transmissible variants of virus, first discovered in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.  Overall, there have been nearly 30 million confirmed cases in the US - the highest figure in the world. But as testing was so limited in spring last year, the true number is probably much higher. One study by scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the real number was as high as 100m towards the end of last year.  Although the decline in cases is good news, it will be a few weeks before it has any major effect on the number of coronavirus patients in hospitals across the US.   That number has been falling for a few weeks now, but more than 80,000 people are currently in hospital - that's still 20,000 more than during the two previous surges last year.   The latest data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project shows the number of Covid patients in hospital is falling in all four regions of the US, with the Midwest having seen the biggest drop since the start of the year.  January was the deadliest month of the pandemic in the US, with 95,000 deaths reported - more than a fifth of the overall death toll of 460,000.  The average number of deaths remains extremely high at 3,000 a day at the moment, but there are now signs of a small decline in recent days.  However, deaths is a metric that lags behind cases and hospitalisations because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-hit to die from the disease. So the US, which already has the highest coronavirus death toll in the world, is likely to pass 500,000 deaths later this month.  There were some initial problems with the rollout of vaccines in the US. The government set a target of vaccinating 20 million Americans by the end of 2020 but managed just three million. However, things improved in January.  President Joe Biden set a goal of 100 million vaccinations administered by his 100th day in office - but they were already well on the way to that before he took office. An average of one million shots a day was hit on 21 January, the day after he was inaugurated. The US is now averaging more than 1.3 million vaccinations a day and Mr Biden has upped his target to 1.5 million a day.  The picture is still quite varied when you look at state-level data though. Alaska is currently top with 19 doses administered per 100 people, but in Alabama the figure is just nine.  It also appears that more needs to be done to ensure vaccines are getting to the most vulnerable groups.  Recent research by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a US healthcare charity, found that black people account for a smaller share of vaccinations compared to their share of cases and deaths in nearly all states reporting such data. By global standards, however, the US programme is going well. The country's average of nearly 12 vaccinations administered per 100 people is above Canada (3) and all of Europe apart from the UK (18). Israel has the highest rate of any country, with 63 per 100 people.  With the vaccine rollout picking up pace, many Americans will be hoping life can return to some form of normality over the next few months - but experts say there's still a long path ahead.  ""It will be many more months before we see not necessarily a return to normalcy, but the emergence of a new normal,"" according to Dr Keri Althoff, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University.  ""I'm hesitant to put a date on it because every time we figure something out with this virus, it seems to have another trick up its sleeve,"" she added, pointing to the new variants that have emerged in recent months.  Dr Althoff says that ""new normal"" will see public health officials continuing to recommend social distancing and face masks while warning against any large social gatherings, inside or out.  ""Many people in the US are feeling exhausted by this virus. It's totally normal and we need to be empathetic towards that, but this virus is not going to just go away,"" she said. ""So we have to continue to protect ourselves and our families and our communities.""

FM 'relieved' wife and mother-in-law get jabs,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has spoken of his ""relief"" after both his wife and mother-in-law received coronavirus vaccinations. The Welsh Labour leader said he was now the only one in his household yet to receive the jab. He said he was ""hugely grateful"" both women had received their first doses. His wife, Clare Drakeford, 66, and her 94-year-old mother, have both shielded during the pandemic due to their health conditions. This meant Mr Drakeford spent some time living alone in a hut at the bottom of his garden. The first minister previously said both women contracted the virus and fell ill last year. ""Due to their conditions they are both in the top four priority groups and have both been vaccinated,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Both experiences were excellent in terms of how smoothly it went and how well it was organised, and they've had no ill effects of any sort."" He said he was ""hugely grateful, because they're both vulnerable"".  ""Although they've been incredibly careful and don't do anything that puts them at risk, the fact they've had the vaccine is a relief,"" he said. ""You can see how it gives people a different outlook, that they can see the light at the end of all of this."" Mr Drakeford, 66, said he would be in the next five priority groups but did not yet have an appointment to be vaccinated. Nearly 590,000 people in the top priority groups have been given their first dose of Covid vaccine in Wales. It means 18.7% of the Welsh population has now been vaccinated. On Saturday, Wales overtook the other UK nations for the first time in the percentage of the population getting their first jab. There was previously criticism the vaccination rollout in Wales had started more slowly than the rest of the UK. Mr Drakeford said he believed the ""unfairness"" of that criticism led to a ""we'll show them"" spirit among those involved. ""People don't like it when they know the criticism isn't fair,"" he said. ""To judge the performance of a system on the first few days, was never going to be the right way to form a judgment."" Wales' aim is to ensure just under 750,000 people - including health workers and people aged over 70 - get a first dose by mid-February.

Scotland aims to vaccinate all adults 'in summer',"Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman has said her ambition is to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. Ms Freeman told BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show that it was ""not sensible"" to give specific dates as it depends on supplies remaining unhindered. On Sunday a further seven deaths were recorded as well as 584 new cases. Official figures also showed 839,266 people had received the first dose of the Covid vaccination - a record increase of 52,839 on Saturday. In total, 94% of over-80s have now had a jab. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that Scotland was ""on track to hit all targets"" after a record day of vaccinations. Once all the priority groups outlined by Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) have been completed, Scotland's vaccine deployment plan moves on to the rest of the population. Ms Freeman said: ""Our ambition is to get through all those 4.5m adults, 18 and over, in the summer. ""At this point it is not very sensible to give specific dates because there are a number of unknowns, partly what the JCVI tell us and partly about supplies. ""But what is the case, is that our infrastructure to do that is there, and we have the vaccinators, we have the support staff, we have the local and the regional centres able to do it.  ""As fast as we get supplies we will be vaccinating."" Ms Freeman warned that Scotland must remain ""cautious"" about the new Covid variants but stressed that the current vaccines are ""very effective"". A record 52,839 vaccinations in ð´ó §ó ¢ó ³ó £ó ´ó ¿ yesterday ð839,226 have now had first dose, inc 99.5% of older care home residents, 90% of staff in older adult care homes, 94%+ of over 80s living in community, 64% of those aged 75-79 and 26% of 70-74 yr olds. On track to hit all targets. The latest Scottish government data showed 108 people were in intensive care with recently confirmed Covid, nine less than Saturday. Hospital numbers were also down by 19, to 1,710. But the test positivity rate had increased from 5.9% to 6.9% since Saturday. The health secretary also told the programme that discussions are still ongoing on how hotel quarantine for people arriving in Scotland from abroad will work.  She would not comment on whether hotel rooms have been booked for the new ""managed quarantine"" policy - due to come into force on 15 February. While the UK government will only require those arriving from ""red list"" countries to quarantine in a hotel, Scotland will require all international travellers to do so, regardless of where they have come from. Meanwhile, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said the UK must remain alert for new strains of Covid. His comments come after early trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab suggested it gives limited protection against mild disease caused by the South Africa variant. AstraZeneca also said it had not yet determined whether the vaccine protects against severe disease caused by this variant. Mr Wallace told The Sunday Show: ""We have to be aware that the lessons we have learned from the past year are not something to be put on a shelf and forgotten. ""This will be an ongoing challenge to the world, how we deal with Covid. ""There is no such thing as a magic wand, this is about managing outbreaks, managing infections and making sure that we constantly develop our vaccines.""

Over 12 million in UK have had first Covid jab,"More than 12 million people in the UK have now had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, after 550,000 first jabs were given out on Saturday. The government is aiming to offer first doses to 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. At the current rate, about 16 million people would receive a first jab by that date. The UK's daily Covid cases continue to fall, but remain high - with another 15,845 reported on Sunday. Another 373 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, the data also showed. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Sundays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. The update on vaccine progress comes as scientists say early trials suggest Oxford-AstraZeneca's jab offers ""minimal protection"" against mild disease from the South Africa variant. Meanwhile, workplace Covid testing is being offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. The speedy rollout of Covid vaccines to all vulnerable people is seen as critical to reducing the pandemic's death toll and relieving pressure on the NHS. Once the first four priority groups, including the over-70s, healthcare workers and people shielding, have received their jabs, the programme will move on to people aged 50 and over and those with underlying health conditions. From spring, the government plans to begin vaccinating the rest of the adult population, another 21 million people. Teachers, transport workers, supermarket workers and the military could be prioritised. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations, and Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each offer their own advice on testing. On Sunday, Scottish health secretary Jeane Freeman said her ambition was to have every adult vaccinated for Covid ""in the summer"". The Scottish government had previously set a September target to vaccinate all over-18s. The UK is currently receiving doses of two vaccines approved by the medicine regulator - the Pfizer-BioNTech jab and a second vaccine, from Oxford University and AstraZeneca. A third vaccine, made by US company Moderna, has been approved but supplies are not expected to be available until spring. The UK is also lined up to receive at least three other vaccines if they are approved for use. In other developments:  Will I get side effects from the vaccine?

Has US finally turned the corner on Covid?,"By Mike HillsBBC News Visual Journalism It's been a long winter for the US, with hospitals seeing more coronavirus patients than at any point in the pandemic and the average number of daily deaths topping 3,000 for the first time. But as spring approaches, the number of infections is now falling and the vaccination programme looks to have overcome some of its initial problems.  So is the US on track to get back to some form of normality in 2021 or do new variants of the virus mean further setbacks are ahead? We've taken a look at the data and spoken to an epidemiologist to assess the situation.  The average number of daily cases in the US had been rising since September - apart from a few dips due to incomplete data over holiday periods like Thanksgiving and Christmas.  But as you can see from the chart below, daily cases have now been falling since early January. There are, however, still more than 120,000 new infections every day on average and it's unclear whether the recent decline will continue - especially now the US has cases of the more highly transmissible variants of virus, first discovered in the UK, South Africa and Brazil.  Overall, there have been nearly 30 million confirmed cases in the US - the highest figure in the world. But as testing was so limited in spring last year, the true number is probably much higher. One study by scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the real number was as high as 100m towards the end of last year.  Although the decline in cases is good news, it will be a few weeks before it has any major effect on the number of coronavirus patients in hospitals across the US.   That number has been falling for a few weeks now, but more than 80,000 people are currently in hospital - that's still 20,000 more than during the two previous surges last year.   The latest data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project shows the number of Covid patients in hospital is falling in all four regions of the US, with the Midwest having seen the biggest drop since the start of the year.  January was the deadliest month of the pandemic in the US, with 95,000 deaths reported - more than a fifth of the overall death toll of 460,000.  The average number of deaths remains extremely high at 3,000 a day at the moment, but there are now signs of a small decline in recent days.  However, deaths is a metric that lags behind cases and hospitalisations because it can take several weeks for those who are worst-hit to die from the disease.

Covid vaccination centres close due to snow,"A number of Covid-19 vaccination centres in the east of England have closed because of heavy snow. An amber warning is in place across much of the east and south-east of England, and eight centres were affected in Essex and Suffolk. They included Clacton Hospital, where those with appointments at the centre on Sunday can rebook from Monday. Two sites in Ipswich closed, and a number of testing centres in Suffolk also shut. As well as their hospital site Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust also had earlier finishes at its sites at the Gainsborough Sports Centre in Ipswich and at Colchester's Jobserve Community Stadium. Five vaccination centres run by Suffolk GP Federation also had earlier closing times. The sites at Trinity Park in Ipswich, Woodbridge Community Hall, Debenham Community Centre and The Mix in Stowmarket closed at midday, while the EpiCentre in Haverhill will shut at 16:00 GMT. Julie Smith, from the federation, said: ""We've had a bit of an assessment of the situation out there with the roads and the sites themselves and unfortunately we think we need, for patient safety reasons, to close early."" She added people could rebook using their booking references, but if they do not, then the federation would reschedule them. A spokesman for the federation said they texted and phoned people to tell them appointments would be rearranged, but added ""unfortunately, it wasn't possible to contact everyone in advance because the decision to close four of our vaccination centres at noon was taken at short notice due to rapidly deteriorating conditions"". He added they ""proactively"" went to the media, and updated their website and social media. Suffolk Resilience Forum said all of the county's testing sites for those with symptoms of Covid-19 are currently closed, adding ""the situation will be reviewed daily"". Testing centres in Bury St Edmunds, Lowestoft and the University of Suffolk in Ipswich for people not displaying symptoms have also been closed. The amber warning - which also means disruption to gas, telephone or mobile phone coverage is likely - covers parts of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Medway and lasts until 12:00 GMT on Monday. Meanwhile, Public Health England (PHE) has issued a cold weather alert for the whole nation through to Wednesday evening.

Peer sorry for calling Covid a 'gift' for lawyers,"Labour's shadow attorney general has apologised for previously describing the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""gift that keeps on giving"" for lawyers. According to the Mail on Sunday, Lord Falconer made the comments during an online event hosted by a legal firm last June. The Labour peer said he had been referring to legal questions arising from frequent changes to the law. ""But I very much regret my choice of words,"" he added.   According to the newspaper, he made the remarks during an online seminar hosted by law firm Gibson Dunn about law changes during the pandemic.  Lord Falconer, who served as justice secretary under former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, is a partner at the company.  In his introduction to the seminar, he is quoted as saying: ""This is a gift that keeps on giving, the law keeps on changing, keeps on getting more complicated, and is always interesting."" The Labour peer told the BBC his comments ""were expressly directed to the pace at which the government is making changes to the law and the legal questions that gives rise to"".  Asked about Lord [Charlie] Falconer's remarks, Labour's shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""He shouldn't have said it. ""He was talking in the context of lawyers and the way the law was changing. But it was a very poor choice of words."" Mr Miliband said he had spoken to his colleague before appearing on the BBC programme and he was ""very, very sorry and apologises for what he said"". ""It shows that we have to be careful with our words, all politicians have to be very careful with our words,"" Mr Miliband went on. ""Charlie thinks the country has been through a terrible, terrible trauma and this in no way reflects his view about the Covid crisis.""  As well as being justice secretary, Lord Falconer was a minister at the transport department, and then the Home Office, during the Blair era.  He went on to be appointed shadow justice secretary under the acting leadership of Harriet Harman, a role he kept under Jeremy Corbyn.  But he was among a dozen shadow cabinet members to later resign in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum over Mr Corbyn's leadership.

Government rules out Covid vaccine passports,"The government has ruled out plans to issue so-called ""vaccine passports"" to enable people who have had the jab against coronavirus to travel abroad. The Greek prime minister has said he would welcome British holidaymakers if they could prove they have been vaccinated.  Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that people could get evidence from their GP.   Labour says vaccine passports may be necessary.  The possibility of giving people ""vaccine passports"" to allow a return to international travel is being debated in the UK and elsewhere. Former UK prime minister Tony Blair and Greek leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis are among those calling for their introduction.  In the UK, more than 11m people have been vaccinated against coronavirus so far.  Mr Zahawi had previously said that the government was ""looking at the technology"" to create vaccine passports, leading to accusations from critics that civil liberties would be infringed.  But speaking on the Marr show, Mr Zahawi insisted that was not the plan.  He said there were several reasons why vaccine passports would not be introduced, not least because the vaccine was not mandatory in the UK.  ""That's not how we do things. We do them by consent,"" he said.  Mr Zahawi said vaccine passports would be ""discriminatory"" and it wasn't clear what impact they would have on transmission of the virus.  He said people could talk to their doctor if they needed written evidence to travel.  ""Of course you have the evidence that you have been vaccinated held by your GP and if other countries require you to show proof of that evidence then that is up to those countries,"" he said.   The shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, said vaccine passports ""may be necessary"" but he was more concerned with getting a comprehensive quarantine programme in place for arrivals in to the UK. Mr Miliband added: ""We should be open to this but there are complications to do this vaccine passport. Is it just for international travel? Is it for as you go about your business in your society?"" He said ""We are five or six weeks on from the South African variant being discovered.  ""We still don't have a quarantine system in place. We still don't have a plan for a comprehensive quarantine system, so let's proceed a step at a time, and of course, look at the vaccine passport  - but let's get the quarantine right and let's get the rollout right too.""

Why are care home residents still dying with Covid?,"It's more than seven weeks since the first care home resident in Scotland received her first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.  Annie Innes said she hoped it meant life could ""get back to normal very soon"".  Since then almost every elderly person living in a Scottish care home has been given the jab.  Yet care homes are still reporting Covid outbreaks and residents are still dying with the virus. Why?  Covid deaths in care homes reached their peak in April 2020, when more than 300 residents died with the virus in a single week.  The death toll during the second wave has been lower but still makes up a significant proportion of all coronavirus deaths.  Since Annie Innes received her first jab, 619 people have died in Scotland's care homes.  There have been outbreaks in homes in Stranraer, Invergordon,Aberdeenshire, Fife and even in the Hamilton home where Mrs Innes was immunised. The following chart shows how many people have died with Covid in care homes, compared to places like hospitals and people's own homes.  It is based on statistics from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) which record how many people had Covid-19 listed on their death certificate, whether or not they tested positive for the virus.  The first doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine were administered at Abercorn House in Hamilton on 14 December last year.  Residents - including Annie Innes and Margaret Keating - posed for the media as they were vaccinated. Inevitably it took time to reach every care home resident in Scotland.  Seven weeks after the first jabs were administered First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed that 98% of Scottish care home residents had received their first dose of the vaccine.  The following chart shows that the week before Christmas and the first week of the new year were the busiest for care home vaccinators.  The vaccine does not provide instant immunity from the worst effects of Covid-19.  Public health expert Professor Linda Bauld said protection starts to build up in the body about 10 days after a person has the first jab. Most people will have a ""reasonable level of protection"" after 21 days but it might take even longer in older people with complex immune systems, she added.  ""So we can say that people are still vulnerable to infection if it gets into care homes prior to having that level of protection,"" Prof Bauld said.  That lag means it could be a couple of weeks before we see the real impact on care home deaths.  ""I expect outbreaks to decline rapidly very soon,"" she said. ""In a couple of weeks' time we would expect these numbers to be going down hugely."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also spoke about the lag effect at the Scottish government's coronavirus briefing on Monday.  She said care home residents and staff were a top priority of the vaccination programme and first doses have been administered ""as quickly as possible"".  But she added: ""Unfortunately there will continue to be some people [who] after they are vaccinated... will become ill and unfortunately potentially die with Covid."" England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccine was already having an impact on the total Covid death rate across the UK.  ""The number of deaths in people who have had Covid is beginning to come down but... the numbers are still extremely high,"" he told Wednesday's UK government briefing. He predicted they would stay high ""for quite some time"" before coming down. ""The first effects we will see of vaccination are likely to be on these death numbers,"" he added. Prof Bauld also pointed out that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine do not provide full protection.  Most care home residents will receive a second dose of the vaccine within 12 weeks of the first.  And neither vaccine is 100% effective.  Trials showed the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was 62% effective, while the Pfizer jab was 95% effective. Both produced a better result than the best flu jab, which is about 50% effective.  Prof Bauld said: ""The vaccine is not going to completely eliminate risk. There might still be some cases - but there will be large reduction.""",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-55891326,1
Extra testing opens to suppress new variant,"Additional testing to track and suppress the spread of a Covid-19 variant has been rolled out in Bristol and South Gloucestershire.  People who do not have symptoms but live in 24 postcode areas are ""strongly encouraged"" to get tested. Additional testing has been introduced in Worcestershire and Sefton after the South Africa variant was found. Bristol City Council's director of public health said people should follow existing health advice.  Christina Gray said: ""The message remains the same, there's no difference or change to our public health message.  ""Act as if you're infected, act as if everyone else is infectious. Hands, face, space and ventilate.""  The surge testing uses PCR tests which are sent off to laboratories for analysis.

Cancer baby family call for stem donor support,"The family of a baby with blood cancer are raising funds to tackle a backlog in the processing of stem donors. One-year-old Mason Arrowsmith was diagnosed with Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukaemia (JMML) on Christmas Eve. He needs a stem cell or bone marrow transplant but there is a backlog of 25,000 applications in the Anthony Nolan cancer charity's register. The charity said there was a ""perfect storm"" of funding being hit by the Covid-19 and a surge in applications. Mason's mother Katie Jordan, from Stockton, said: ""The hospital has been absolutely amazing, but unfortunately after searching worldwide there is no match for Mason due to his bone marrow being so rare.  ""We need to get him to transplant as soon as, the hospital is looking at the end of February, using me as his first donor in the hope that this will help him until we find a better match.  ""I would give my life for Mason but unfortunately I can only donate my bone marrow three times in a lifetime and I'm not a full match for him.  ""Children with JMML live around twelve months after diagnosis, we need to find Mason a better match.  ""Twelve months is not long enough for us to have with our boy, we are living the worst possible nightmare."" Anthony Nolan said it costs Â£40 to recruit a potential donor for the register with costs including buying swab packs and paying for laboratory analysis. The charity's chief executive Henny Braund said: ""Finding a match would mean everything to Mason and his family and we're doing all we can to find a stem cell donor to give Mason a second chance of life.  ""A perfect storm of the coronavirus pandemic, and a surge of 40,000 incredible people who have been inspired to join the Anthony Nolan register in the last month - by patients like Mason - means that we're in urgent need.""  The family has raised more than Â£15,000 so far through its online Mason's Mission appeal. Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

Call for UK-wide Covid rules for 'consistency',"A ""common framework"" of UK-wide Covid rules should be adopted, according to the leader of the Tories in the Senedd. Andrew RT Davies wants Welsh ministers to work with the UK government to provide ""consistency"" in areas where all four UK chief medical officers ""undoubtedly agree"". Mr Davies said devolution ""shouldn't mean the Welsh Government should always do things differently"". Wales currently has a lower Covid case rate than England and Northern Ireland. The youngest pupils will return to Welsh primary schools the week after the February half-term, but English schools are not set to reopen until the start of March.  Speaking in the Senedd on Tuesday, the first minister said he was ""pleased"" the Welsh Government had ""regular meetings with the UK government every Wednesday - and a number of days in between most weeks now - where we are able to talk about common approaches"". But Mark Drakeford added: ""We will all [four governments in the UK], nonetheless, be calibrating the decisions that we make in the circumstances that we face.  ""The number of people falling ill with coronavirus per 100,000 of the population in Wales is falling at the moment every day.  ""It's about half the level that is to be seen across the border in England. I wouldn't want to deny Welsh businesses or outdoor attractions the chance of opening earlier if our circumstances allowed that to happen."" Boris Johnson has said he intends to announce plans to ease England's lockdown restrictions from the 22 February. Writing in the Sunday Times, the Conservatives' Senedd leader said his party ""rejects the 'how can Wales be different just for the sake of it' approach of Welsh Labour."" Mr Davies said: ""That doesn't mean each and every decision made by a Conservative government in Wales would be identical to one made by a Conservative government in Westminster.  ""But it's time for consistency in areas where all four chief medical officers of the United Kingdom undoubtedly agree, rather than persisting with the professor in the Bay's policy of poking the prime minister in the eye at every turn.  ""Like people and business across Wales, we want to cut the politics and see the adoption of a common framework on restrictions."" In his article, Mr Davies referenced a recent YouGov poll conducted in Wales. The poll from January suggested 63% of respondents believed decisions around lockdown measures should happen at the same time for the whole of the UK even if some areas are at different levels than others at reducing the spread of the virus. A separate question asking how coronavirus lockdown rules are decided suggested that 47% believed the UK government should decide the rules for the whole of the UK, 43% said devolved governments should decide the rules, with 10% saying they didn't know.

Why are some of Bradford's elderly refusing the vaccine?,"Covid vaccinations have been administered at pace in Bradford, as in the rest of the UK. But data for December and January indicates a high level of refusal among those aged 80 or over in the Pakistani community. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary asks why, and considers the implications. By the end of January 67,000 people had received at least one Covid vaccination in Bradford including 82.5% of those aged 80 and above. It's an important achievement and a big step towards protecting the most vulnerable. However, dig a little deeper and there are some concerning numbers in the data. While within the White British and Mixed-race British ethnic groups 87% of people in this age bracket have been vaccinated, only 46% of the 1,800 people aged 80 and over in the Pakistani community have been vaccinated - and 23% have refused the vaccine. These figures are provided by GPs who have been calling people at home, and inviting them to come and get vaccinated. Among the 30% of those aged 80 or over in the Pakistani community who have neither been vaccinated nor refused the vaccine, it's likely that some - perhaps many - are undecided. I hope that we will yet persuade them to have the jab, because anyone who doesn't remains at risk as long as the virus is circulating, which is likely to be for some months yet. It's too early to say whether the same pattern will be repeated for those in their 70s. Vaccine hesitancy is nothing new. On the website of the Science Museum you can see a framed reproduction of some data about smallpox cases, published in the Times in July 1923. ""Convincing Facts!"" it reads. ""Those who disbelieve in vaccination should ponder the following figures issued by the health committee of Gloucester."" Below there is a small table. ""Total admissions to hospital for smallpox - 350,"" reads the first line. And, under that, the key piece of information: ""Unvaccinated - 319"". It is sad that the people refusing the vaccine today will be some of the patients with severe Covid in hospital tomorrow. The over-80s - the highest-risk group in society - will be in particular danger if they live in homes with younger people, who go back to work or resume social contacts when lockdown is lifted. We were already aware, thanks to a survey by researchers at Born in Bradford and the Bradford Institute for Health Research, that South Asian and Eastern European communities were more likely to be unsure about the vaccine, or opposed to it, than others. Socio-economic status also plays a role, the researchers discovered, with these hesitant or sceptical attitudes more common in less well-off households.  Overall they found that 30% of people were ready for the vaccine and 10% would refuse it, with the majority undecided.  Interviews to explore these attitudes further showed that much of the hesitancy was nuanced and understandable. In many cases people realised that the vaccine was the only way out of this pandemic, but still had concerns.          Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Some worried about safety, aware that this vaccine had been developed at speed - in 10 months rather than 10 years, which would be a more typical timeframe.  Maurice Hilleman, the famous microbiologist responsible for developing over 40 vaccines - including vaccines for Asian and Hong Kong flu - famously said that he only breathed a sigh of relief when three million doses of a vaccine had been given. Our respondents echoed his anxiety. But now that nearly 12 million doses have been given in the UK alone, the evidence is overwhelming: the vaccine is safe. We need to find a way of getting this information across. Another group of people told the researchers that as they were young and healthy, and so unlikely to get serious illness from the virus, they didn't feel they needed the vaccine any more than they needed the annual flu vaccine. But while it's true that in most cases young people do not suffer badly with Covid, this ignores the risk of transmission to older relatives. The researchers also found a loss of trust in the government due to mixed-messages and contradictory rules - and worryingly this mistrust appears to have crept over to the NHS. Traditional media outlets were also thought to be acting as government messengers, with the result that people turned to other less reputable sources of information. The spread of misinformation was more prevalent in the South Asian and Eastern European communities, perhaps because they have strong internal links. To combat this misinfo-demic, we are working with people from within BAME communities. Faith leaders have endorsed the Covid vaccine by having the injection themselves. On Thursday a pop-up vaccination centre will open in a mosque in Keighley. Hopefully it will be the first of many. We have also set up a fantastic network of bright, young ambassadors from within the BAME community, to fight misinformation with truth. Very often those who are vaccine-hesitant have a limited grasp of the science; our ambassadors can help fill in the gaps in their knowledge, and provide reassurance.  Jordan Lee, a 20-year-old studying clinical sciences at the university of Bradford, is one of them. He notes that his own family are more inclined to trust rumours they find on social media than information from their GP's surgery. If anyone can persuade them to change their mind, it will be Jordan.  Sarah Hamaway, a student of pharmacy, has found that even colleagues in the chemist's where she has a part-time job have said they don't intend to have the vaccination. They've heard the rumours about the vaccine containing microchips, for example, and they are scared. She is trying to reassure them, and to correct these misconceptions. With convinced anti-vaxxers the chances of success may be slim, but the ambassadors could have some influence with that large group of waverers. Tom Ratcliffe, a GP in Keighley, north-west of Bradford, points out that there's a risk that Covid will remain endemic in pockets of the population where there is a low uptake of vaccination. Nearly a fifth of the population of the area covered by the Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group (which provided the data above about vaccine refusal) falls into the Pakistani/British Pakistani category, and it's a group, Ratcliffe notes, that has been more vulnerable to the virus than some others. ""This is a population at high risk and yet also at high risk of not being vaccinated,"" as he puts it. One plan is to hold single-sex vaccine clinics, which may encourage women in the Pakistani community to get vaccinated. He is also putting some faith in the pop-up vaccination clinic that will be held in the Keighley mosque. ""In multi-generational households we find that everyone needs to reach consensus. In our Pakistani communities we have to try and persuade key people in those family networks. We need to gain the trust in families and we hope that the clinics in the mosque will help with that,"" he says. It could be that if the children of elderly first-generation immigrants can be convinced the vaccine is safe, then some of those in their 70s and 80s who have not so far responded to their GP's invitation will finally come forward. One of the least-expected pockets of vaccine hesitancy Ratcliffe has discovered is within a group of about 50 street drinkers. ""They are largely living on the streets so they are very vulnerable,"" he says. ""We run a clinic for them but again we have issues - they're refusing the vaccine and have bought into the crazy myths. Even though some of them inject all sorts of things, they won't have the vaccine."" Regular readers of this diary may remember Abdul Majid, a science graduate whose father, Abdul Saboor, has been in intensive care since October. He says a great variety of conspiracy theories are swirling around, generating much discussion in Bradford's Pakistani community. Some are saying they will have the vaccination, others that they won't. ""At this present time I'm scared to take the vaccine,"" he says. ""So, you know, I'm just waiting to see what reaction people get."" We must hope that as more people have the vaccination and show no ill effects, vaccine hesitancy will decline. And we must also continue with initiatives to reassure the undecided. Follow @docjohnwright and radio producer @SueM1tchell on Twitter",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/health-55952189,1
University aims to answer Covid antibody questions,"It is one of the key questions in the battle against coronavirus - how are our bodies equipped to fight off the infection? At Ulster University, a research team has been trying to find an answer by delving into a study of antibodies. And the team has been helped by hundreds of people in Northern Ireland who are taking part in the research. On Sunday, they will - one by one - take an antibody test in a bid to shed light on the issue of immunity. The study at Ulster University's Jordanstown campus in County Antrim is being led by Prof Jim McLaughlin and Prof Tara Moore. ""We are delighted with the response of the Northern Ireland public and their willingness to help us with this research,"" said Prof Moore, a specialist in personalised medicine. The researchers have sought a range of people to take part in the study. Firstly, those who have had a positive coronavirus test between 26 December last year and 23 January. People who are ""fairly confident"" they have never had Covid-19 or have had limited contact with other people have also been enlisted as well as those who have recently had a negative test for the virus. Those taking part on Sunday will each be tested for the virus using a nasal swab and a finger-prick blood test will enable the scientists to check for antibodies. A blood sample will also be taken for further testing. ""The presence of antibodies would indicate that an individual has previously been exposed to the virus that causes Covid-19,"" said Prof Moore. ""The blood samples we take will allow us to do a comparisons between finger-prick antibody levels and that of blood plasma and serum. ""It's valuable for the people who take part - they will know that day if they have antibodies."" Prof Moore is hoping her team can do another study, offering people an antibody test before their vaccine, after they are vaccinated and then a follow-up test to see how long the antibodies last. ""So far some of the [research] at Ulster University has shown that antibodies can last up to 10 months"" she added. ""The longevity of antibodies was interesting and it didn't increase or decrease with age."" All students and staff at Ulster University are being offered regular rapid antigen tests on campus. Antigen screening allows the team to detect coronavirus in people who have no symptoms and are not aware they are infected. The process, Prof Moore said, is vital in reducing transmission and allowing society to return to normality.

Care homes 'could close' without funding guarantee,"By Cemlyn DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent Care homes could be forced to close unless the Welsh Government extends ""vital"" funding for them, according to the body representing the sector. Care Forum Wales said existing ""hardship funds"" have only been guaranteed until the end of March. The older people's commissioner for Wales added it was important to ""provide the support that's needed"". The Welsh Government said an extra Â£88m has been provided to date and it was finalising next year's budget.  Hardship funds have been ""absolutely vital in keeping care homes open"", Care Forum Wales' chief executive Mary Wimbury told the BBC's Politics Wales programme. ""Unlike a lot of other businesses, care homes have to carry on during this pandemic and their costs have gone up - it's things like the increased staffing, infection control measures and also we've seen more empty beds during the crisis so income's gone down,"" she said.  ""We've only got a guarantee that's going to be there until the end of March this year and it's absolutely vital if we're to keep the sector sustainable in any way that it continues beyond that because we're not going to have seen the end of the pandemic by the end of March."" Asked what could happen if the funding stopped, Ms Wimbury said: ""I can't see how we won't see care homes closing, very sadly.   ""That will obviously have a serious effect - not just on future provision, but also on those people that live in those homes that are in that situation. ""You're talking about vulnerable older people. The last thing you want is for them to have to move in any circumstances, but particularly during a pandemic."" The older people's commissioner for Wales HelÃ©na Herklots welcomed all the support provided by ministers, but warned ""we're not through this pandemic yet"". ""It's going to be important that Welsh Government continues to provide the support that's needed over the coming weeks and months as we go through the next phase of the pandemic,"" she added. Office for National Statistics figures show there had been 1,396 Covid-related care home deaths in Wales up to 22 January - 22% of the total deaths linked to the virus.  The week up to 22 January also saw the highest weekly tally of care home deaths since the start of the pandemic. However, the number of positive cases identified in care homes is falling - down to its lowest since October.   Plans to carry out extra testing in older people's care homes have also been welcomed by the sector.   Earlier this week, ministers said a jab has now been offered to residents and staff at every older people's care home that ""it was possible to reach"".  The latest statistics show 78.2% of care home residents in Wales have had their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Ms Herklots said she was ""keen to see faster progress"" with vaccinating the remaining residents. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We recognise there are additional financial pressures - these are currently supported through our hardship fund.  ""More than Â£88m has been distributed to date, with existing provisions extending to the end of the financial year. We are in the process of finalising the budget for next year.""

Covid tests expanded to more workplaces in England,"Workplace Covid testing is being offered to more companies in England, for staff who cannot work from home during lockdown, the government says. Businesses with more than 50 employees are now able to access lateral flow tests, which can produce results in less than 30 minutes. Previously only firms with more than 250 staff qualified for testing. Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged businesses and employees to take up the offer to ""stop this virus spreading"". ""When you consider that around one in three people have the virus without symptoms and could potentially infect people without even knowing it, it becomes clear why focusing testing on those without symptoms is so essential,"" he said, adding that firms should regularly test staff. The government said the wider criteria would ""hugely"" increase the number of different businesses that are able to sign up, with small and medium sized companies now able to take part. A website has been launched for more businesses to register for the rapid testing programme. It comes as England's national lockdown continues, and the UK's daily reported coronavirus deaths and cases remain high. The latest figures showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people. Meanwhile, GPs in England will be paid an additional Â£10 by the NHS for every housebound patient they vaccinate against Covid-19. As well as offering vaccinations at their practices, GPs have been visiting patients to provide jabs to often vulnerable people who cannot leave their homes. The extra Â£10-per-visit funding is to recognise the extra staff time and complexity of vaccinating housebound people, NHS England said. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the expanded workplace testing regime would complement the rollout of Covid vaccines in the drive to ""reopen the economy and recover our way of life as soon as it is safe to do so"". And the British Chambers of Commerce said it would be ""working hard to ensure that eligible businesses take up this opportunity"". But union officials said employers could not rely on lateral flow testing alone to ensure the safety of staff, citing that Public Health England (PHE) found examples of missed asymptomatic positive cases during the mass testing pilot in Liverpool last year. Dan Shears, GMB union's health, safety and environment director, said: ""These rapid tests are not a magic bullet, and it is vital that employers understand the limitations and take steps to address them. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth welcomed the extra testing but said ""so much more needs to be done to make workplaces Covid-secure including improving ventilation and upgraded PPE (personal protection equipment) standards"". ""This is even more important when the most recent data shows hundreds of outbreaks in workplaces since the start of January,"" he said. Some 112 UK organisations have so far signed up to take part in workplace testing, with employees being tested across 500 sites, according to government figures. This includes private sector organisations in the food, manufacturing, energy and retail sectors, and public sector employers such as job centres, transport networks, and the military. NHS Test and Trace said that, as of 29 January, it had provided Transport for London (TfL) staff with 2,173 tests, identifying 28 positive cases who would have otherwise continued working alongside colleagues. But a CBI survey found that 87% of UK businesses were not currently testing in the workplace, citing reasons such as the availability of NHS testing for individuals, unclear guidance, and the operational, logistical and/or regulatory complexity of offering testing. Of those not carrying out workplace testing, 69% said they were not planning to offer testing in the next three months. The CBI said the government had ""a big role"" to provide guidance and make it simple to introduce workplace testing.  According to the Department of Health, tests are currently being provided free to both public and private sector employers until at least 31 March, and the government's support will be kept under review. NHS Test and Trace will support organisations to deliver the asymptomatic testing by supplying the kits, and offering guidance and training for delivery. The additional funding for GPs is retrospective and will apply to any vaccinations that have already been delivered to those who cannot leave their homes. More than 1,000 GP services are part of the NHS vaccination programme, alongside over 250 hospital hubs and nearly 200 services run by high street pharmacies. The UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each offer their own advice on testing.

Vaccine chief 'optimistic' about over-50s May goal UK reports 12,027 cases on Friday What is the UK's R number and why does it matter?",5,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55967069,1
Uneasy Lib Dems ponder long road back to EU,"By Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Where do the Lib Dems stand on rejoining the EU? That is the question they need to answer if they are ever to find their way out of the post-Brexit wilderness. In one short sentence, Sir Ed Davey appeared to have thrown away everything the Liberal Democrats have fought for in recent times.  Asked by Andrew Marr about the party's stance on rejoining the European Union, the Lib Dem leader said: ""We are not a re-join party, but we are a very pro-European party.""  Given that the Liberal Democrats adopted a policy at their party conference last year of supporting UK membership of the EU in the long term, members were quick to react.  ""I was shocked and angry,"" said George Potter, a Lib Dem councillor in Surrey, describing Sir Ed's comments as ""a complete contradiction of party policy"".  People higher up the party ranks were also alarmed, with at least one senior figure calling the leader straight away to seek an explanation. Sir Ed's choice of words may have been an attempt to avoid a narrow line of questioning about when and how the UK might be able to regain membership of the EU, but the statement was too blunt for many. Something of a damage limitation exercise was undertaken, including a Zoom call with MPs and others during which the leader apologised for what some saw as an error of judgement.  A few days later the leader wrote a blog post further clarifying his position, stressing the Liberal Democrats were ""committed to the UK being members of the European Union again"". Sir Ed Davey insists that while members may have ""misinterpreted"" what he said on the Marr programme, once he was able to clarify his answer ""people were completely relaxed"".  ""What we're doing now is campaigning on the recovery from coronavirus but it doesn't stop us talking about the EU,"" he told BBC News.  A senior party source suggested a full-on re-join campaign now would leave the Lib Dems looking ""out of touch with what's going on"".  But while there is no denying the need for any political party to be seen to take a stand on the most pressing crisis the country has faced in decades, many Lib Dems are impatient to see the issue of EU membership prioritised once again.  But how best should they make the case? Life was easier when they were campaigning flat out to stay in the EU. ""What Brexit did is give us a clarity of message we've rarely had, the kind of thing we always said we craved - a really clear simple purpose,"" says former party leader Tim Farron. As someone who went through the media mill when he was leader, he has some sympathy with Sir Ed over his Marr interview. ""I understand why it caused some trouble, but he was bowled a googly, kept his wicket and allowed to bat the rest of the over,"" he said.  He urged the party to be ""cool-headed"" in its approach to rejoining the EU, and to avoid at all costs being drawn into a ""culture war"" with the Conservatives on the issue. The majority of Lib Dems would accept the road to re-joining the EU will be a relatively long one with no guarantee of reaching the destination - but some are keen to at least set out the route.  ""We do need to show a way back here that's going to put us in a position to rejoin as a future date, if the stars were to align and we'd be able to do that as a country,"" argues Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem MP for Orkney and Shetland. He recently said the UK should join EFTA, the organisation with access to the EU's single market but without membership of the bloc, as soon as possible.  Some grassroots see it as the party's job to speak up for those who want be back in the EU - but others suggest that taking a ""rejoin now"" approach will damage the argument in the longer term.  Councillor John Potter (no relation to his Surrey colleague) argues that highlighting the economic impact of Brexit and the consequences of Boris Johnson's trade deal with the EU are the best ways to make the case for EU membership in the longer term.  ""The Brexiteers and Johnson government have to own what is coming their way,"" said the Preston councillor, who hosts the Lib Dem podcast.  Sir Ed appears to agree, telling the BBC: ""I'm pretty firm that this trade deal is a disaster and we will make the argument that the single market and customs union are things we should be backing and campaigning on."" This could be a make-or-break year for the Lib Dems in Scotland, where they have sunk to just five seats out of 129 at Holyrood. The party's cause - ahead of elections in May - was not helped by Sir Ed's Marr interview, according to insiders.  ""Some people there had some questions to ask,"" says a senior party source, with a hint of understatement. Being pro-union, and pro-EU, is central to the party's offer, setting them apart from the dominant SNP. ""In Scotland it's particularly important that people know that the party is absolutely clear that we are a party that wants to remain in the UK and works toward that eventual end goal of being able to return,"" said Edinburgh West MP Christine Jardine.  ""You don't argue in favour of joining one union by breaking up another."" The Lib Dems' leader in Scotland, Willie Rennie, agrees. ""We shouldn't repeat the mistakes of Brexit with independence,"" he says. ""Independence would be Brexit on stilts."" Separating those two issues will be one of many challenges for the Lib Dems at May's polls. Any Liberal Democrat will tell you that optimism is an essential quality to remain committed to the cause of a party firmly back in the margins of British politics.  But Sir Ed Davey is clearly keen to administer a dose of realism for those daring to dream that rejoining the EU might be within the UK's grasp.  ""We get that we lost the battle to stop Brexit,"" he wrote in his blog post to members last month.  When former leader Jo Swinson lost her seat at the 2019 general election it seemed the party was at rock bottom and the Lib Dems have seen their support remain stagnant at about 7% in UK-wide opinion polls since.  But there is more than blind hope in the arguments of those who see rejoining the EU as something which the UK can and should achieve in the not too distant future.  So how long might it take and what conditions would have to present themselves for what seems politically impossible in 2021 to become a reality? Tim Farron predicts ""two years of the emotional stuff"" where anyone criticising the post-Brexit trade deal will be ""dismissed as whining Remoaners"".  But after a ""practical assessment"" about the economic impact of Brexit ""from Conservative backbenchers as much as anywhere else"", he predicts the arguments will start to be made for a closer relationship with the EU. Over the next five to 10 years, the UK will ""slowly but surely align"" with European regulation and ""there's a 75% chance of us being back in the EU in a generation,"" he suggests.   In Lancashire, there's more optimism. ""Within 10 years we might be some way back,"" John Potter suggests. But the local activist does not expect to see even the Lib Dems campaigning to re-join the EU as a priority at the next general election.  ""Possibly the one after that,"" he offers tentatively.   From the top there is unsurprisingly a reluctance to offer any time scale but Sir Ed Davey too predicts a slow and steady increase in support for a closer relationship with the EU. ""I think the arguments I've been making now for much close trading relationship will gather some steam and support among others who might've been more sceptical. ""Focusing on the trading relationship will gradually, hopefully, change people's minds over time."" Along with being optimistic, Liberal Democrats are used to playing a long game. Left wounded in their post-Brexit political wasteland, they are tentatively regrouping for perhaps the longest game yet.

The people helping Covid patients speak again,"By Rebecca WoodsBBC News, West Midlands ""I was very, very ill. I had lost the ability to swallow - one of my vocal cords had been paralysed by the ventilator.  ""It was clear I'd fought off Covid, but now I couldn't speak."" Robert Crowther had just woken up in intensive care where he had been unconscious for a month. A civil engineer, the construction site he was working on in the Midlands remained in operation as the UK went into lockdown last March. Within days of complaining of a headache, he was fighting for his life in a Birmingham hospital. While coronavirus itself left its mark on Robert with a persistent serious chest infection, it was the effect of weeks in ICU that caused the most lasting damage. Muscle wastage from lying on a bed meant he was unable to walk. But the impact of tubes from a mechanical ventilator that kept him breathing for weeks, and a tracheostomy to allow air into his lungs, left him unable to talk, eat or drink. Robert is among thousands of patients rehabilitated by speech therapists, the often hidden front-line workers who have continued tirelessly throughout the pandemic to help people regain the most basic of human functions. After weeks away from his panic-stricken wife Andrea and son Henry, 17, the inability to communicate after regaining consciousness was more isolating that ever. ""If the nursing staff asked me a question, they could sometimes lip read what I was trying to say, but I became frustrated when I could not make myself understood. ""I could answer yes and no by head movements. I could only attract their attention if they happened to be looking my way.""  Robert learned to walk again quite quickly with the help of physiotherapists, but it was the speech therapists at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital (QE) who became the main players in his recovery. Back in spring 2020, the consequences of coronavirus were still being learned in hospitals across the world. Dr Camilla Dawson, the QE's consultant speech and language therapist, and many of her colleagues had worked through the swine flu epidemic of 2009, so had an idea of what lay ahead. ""Whilst we could predict what the complexities of the disease might have been, the huge volume of patients was not something we could have predicted, and the pressure that had on our clinical services,"" says Dr Dawson. As the first wave took hold and the QE's ICU filled up with the seriously ill, the 25-strong team began the most intensive work of their careers. There has been little respite for them since; the impact of the second wave seeing the intensive care unit go way over capacity with Covid patients alone - more than 100 sufferers of coronavirus at times when there are usually 75 beds in total.  Across the country, therapists who would work with outpatients have had to cancel everything but emergency treatment - many were drafted in to work in critical care in full PPE and have been there since the start of the outbreak.  ""We are working different shift patterns, longer hours and weekends,"" says Dr Dawson. Everyone is feeling the pressure of working at the front line of a global pandemic. ""We work hard to make sure people can emotionally process what's going on,"" she adds. ""This is, fingers crossed, a once in a career time. We are all looking out for each other. ""The compassion and responsibility is unshakeable in the NHS. You can't see our faces at the moment, but we are still holding people's hands."" Many patients have a long recovery ahead - 60% of those who have been intubated for at least seven to 10 days have problems swallowing. The function of the voice box can be ravaged, vocal cords severely damaged. For those who cannot swallow, the main focus is to prevent aspiration pneumonia - food or liquid could go down the windpipe and cause a severe infection.  ""They'd give me a teaspoon of water but it was going down to my lungs,"" remembers Robert. When he could swallow a little water, he moved on to the tiniest amounts of crushed ice and yoghurt. Other exercises might include working on swallow strength, work to improve the strength and stamina of the voice and to reduce tension in the throat. Amid the relentlessness of working long hours on packed wards, there are moments of pure joy for both patients and staff, often when they finally feel able to video-call their worried loved ones. ""They held my phone and could lip read what I was trying to say and spoke for me,"" says Robert, who was persuaded to call despite being unable to talk well.  ""Andrea and Henry were delighted to see me and it helped them to realise that I was recovering and would be coming home."" After 45 days in ICU and several more weeks on a ward, Robert was able to go home, albeit with a feeding tube. By the third week of August, five months after he contracted Covid-19, he was able to eat and drink properly again. He continued seeing the speech therapy team and in November last year, his voice ""just came back"".  Robert says he feels ""very grateful"" to the people who helped him speak, eat and drink again.  ""You know they're important to you but you don't realise how life-changing they are until you lose them; this has made me realise it is."" Thousands of survivors of Covid are continuing to have speech therapy sessions after being left with long-term problems. The NHS website Your Covid Recovery helps sufferers identify voice and swallow issues. ""It's a far more complex virus than we originally imagined,"" says Kamini Gadhok, chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. ""We are still learning about patients' recovery but we are doing really well as a profession to pick things up and learn from it."" Therapists around the world are clocking off shift and sharing knowledge with each other. ""I'm very proud of them,"" adds Ms Gadhok.  ""It makes me want to weep - they work these incredibly long hours and then want to do a webinar so we can learn more about it."" Dr Dawson, an expert in critical care for the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, describes her industry's work as ""unique"". ""Eating, drinking and communicating are core and innate parts of being human,"" she says. ""These functions enable us to connect, to be with people and share experiences, central to our cultures and the way we interact with society.""  Seeing people recover is the most rewarding part of the job, not least those who have managed to beat coronavirus. ""We are with people through the toughest, most isolating time. It's the most overwhelming feeling to know how hard an individual has worked and how much opportunity they will have as a result of their treatment.

Vaccine chief 'optimistic' about over-50s May goal,"The UK can meet the target of vaccinating all over-50s by May, the chairman of the vaccines taskforce has said, adding he is ""very optimistic"". Dr Clive Dix told the BBC the taskforce has met every target set. The UK would be ""ahead of the game"" in terms of anticipating variants of coronavirus and was making ""libraries of future vaccines"", he said. He added that the UK would not hoard supplies but would distribute them globally, once the UK target is met.  Downing Street has said everyone in the UK aged 50 and over should have been offered a coronavirus vaccine by May. Previously, ministers had said it was their ""ambition"" to vaccinate the first nine priority groups by the spring. As of Friday, the UK had given a first jab to nearly 11.5 million people and is aiming to reach 15 million vaccinations by 15 February. The latest figures also showed another 828 people in the UK have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, and there were a further 18,262 cases. Dr Dix, who heads the government unit charged with developing and producing vaccines, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will work day and night to ensure we meet whatever the target that's feasible can be met.  ""So I'm very optimistic that we will meet the May target."" Questions have been raised around the efficacy of vaccines against variants of the virus - including the one first identified in Kent. On Friday, Oxford-AstraZeneca said its vaccine gave people good protection against the UK variant. Variants in South Africa and Brazil have also been identified. Dr Dix, who is also chief executive of drug discovery company C4X Discovery, said the UK was ""at the forefront of surveying"" the variants, allowing scientists to ""second-guess"" mutations that have not yet occurred. They can then make vaccines for those variants, he told the programme. ""We'll make libraries of future vaccines, just small amounts, enough to then, if it does occur, do a quick clinical study to see that it works and then start manufacturing it,"" he said. The NHS has the staff, the volunteers and the clinics needed to vaccinate the 15 million in these next priority groups as well as give second doses to those who have already had their first jab. But vaccine production is a biological process so there are no guarantees about how much can be grown. However, there is growing confidence in the UK supply chain.  The bulk of the supplies are now coming from UK-based plants producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and the yields from these are now consistently in line with expectation unlike those in Europe which started producing the vaccine later and have had less time to iron out the teething problems. On top of this, supplies from Pfizer-BioNTech are expected to increase from mid-February after a slowdown in recent weeks. There will also be a third vaccine made by US firm Moderna to help. The first batches of the 17 million ordered will start arriving before Easter. It will all be needed as there can be no let up if the over-50s are to get vaccinated in the timeframe set out. Asked whether there could be a vaccine-busting variant at some stage, Dr Dix said: ""There's a possibility, but we'll be ahead of the game, we're not going to be waiting for it to happen.  ""We now have the capabilities in the UK to be responsive and that capability won't just be for the use of the UK of course.  ""Once we've done it, it will actually help the whole world because it will be part of that whole surveillance and reaction."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that mutations of the virus could lead to a ""cycle"" of lockdowns in the future if measures were not put in place, such as effective contact tracing. ""The worry that we have to really plan for is the possibility that we will have a new mutation that is actually immune to the vaccines that we're giving out at the moment,"" Mr Hunt said. ""So, in order to make sure that we don't get caught out by that again, we need to get transmission levels down to the kind of levels where we can do incredibly thorough contact tracing, like they do in Korea and Taiwan."" He also repeated his call for the government to consider more financial support for people told to self-isolate by NHS contact tracers, for example by offering to ""make up any salary losses"". Despite the promising news over vaccines, doctors have warned against relaxing rules too quickly. Dr Daniele Bryden, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, told Today: ""I think the vaccination is really encouraging, but we really can't let our guard down and relax the rules.  ""For example, the average age of a patient on intensive care at the moment is only 60 and 40% of people on intensive care are less than that age. So it's going to take some time before we see the impact of vaccination."" Every adult in the UK will be offered a vaccine by the autumn, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last month. Meanwhile, surge testing is being rolled out to further areas to control and suppress the spread of coronavirus variants, including in: The Department for Health and Social Care said people living in targeted areas were ""strongly encouraged"" to take a Covid test this week, whether showing symptoms or not. Testing for the South African variant is also due to be increased in Southport after a second case was detected. Have you been affected by any issues relating to the vaccine rollout?

Clarity call on reopening Wales to tourists,"Tourism bosses are seeking a ""roadmap"" to help the sector to prepare ahead of any decision to reopen in Wales. It comes after First Minister Mark Drakeford said some sections could open by Easter as long as the Covid-19 situation continues to improve. One caravan park had 100 bookings on Friday - compared with the usual 25 - after Mr Drakeford's comments. But another site with customers mostly from north-west England said they seemed cautious about booking ahead. The Welsh Government said it wants businesses to be open and trading ""as soon it is safe to do so"".  Wales has been under a level four lockdown since before Christmas with some businesses closed and people ordered to avoid all but essential travel. Tom Beynon, from Three Cliffs Bay Holiday Park in Gower, said inquiries ""went around the bend"" on Friday with a lot of customers from Wales looking to holiday closer to home. He said daily bookings and inquiries at this time of year had already doubled from 25 to 50 but they shot up to 100 on Friday night ""due to Mr Drakeford's positivity"". ""Is that people reading between the lines that you can go away but [stay] within Wales?"" he said. The park's season traditionally runs between April and October and staff are preparing to reopen as usual ""unless told otherwise"", said Mr Beynon. Barmouth mayor, councillor Katie Price, who also owns a B&B in the Gwynedd town, said a ""roadmap"" was needed so hospitality businesses ""know where they stand"". ""People may have to make new adaptations to their businesses, but how can they start to put things in place when they have no promise of an income or deadline as to when that needs to be done?"" she said. ""The process of reopening has to have full community confidence, so people who live here feel safe, as well as our customers."" She said that tourism was ""one of the biggest parts of the economy"" in Barmouth and added that ""from a business point of view"" footfall is needed when hospitality reopens, which should be reflected in travel rules.  Ceri Roberts, from Fron Farm Country Holiday Park, at Hendre, near Mold, Flintshire, said the tourism industry and holidaymakers needed ""certainty, definite dates for people to be able to book with confidence"". She said 98% of customers came from over the English border with people ""cautious"" about booking a place at the site due to differing Covid restrictions last year. Mrs Roberts said the business had pledged to offer refunds if cancellations were necessary to give customers confidence. She has also called for guidance about what could be allowed to reopen as campers were unable to book a pitch for a time last year when shared amenity blocks had to remain closed due to Covid rules. ""I'm more positive about taking caravan and static bookings,"" she said. Berin Jones, of the Shelbourne Hotel, in Llandudno, was ""delighted"" by the news there was a possibility of reopening.  ""We traded for 10 weeks of last year in the last 12 months,"" he said.  ""It's absolutely essential that all the supporting industries, suppliers and everything else, are able to start planning to reopen and get working again. ""We really need a timetable from (Mark Drakeford) now, we need to understand well in advance when it is he expects to open up campsites, when it is he expects to open up hotels."" Meanwhile, Gwynedd council is planning to hold a summit next month with councillors and Snowdonia National Park Authority officials following ""unprecedented"" visitors to Snowdon since the pandemic began, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Council leader Dyfrig Siencyn told the education and economy scrutiny committee that such ""unsustainable tourism"" could not continue to be accommodated. ""I've been personally accused of being anti-tourism despite growing up in a home which was let out as a bed and breakfast, and it's right that we remember it's an important industry for us,"" he said. ""But the pandemic has perhaps shown we're almost wholly reliant on tourism in rural areas such as Gwynedd and have very little choice, which drives us to create a much more varied economy rather than all our eggs being in one basket."" A Welsh Government spokesman said that restrictions in Wales are kept ""under constant review"" and it will ""always work with sectors to ensure businesses have as much notice as possible"" about changes to Covid rules. ""The public health situation is improving thanks to everyone's hard work and sacrifices but we all need to stay at home for a while longer to bring levels of the virus down further.""

Scottish vaccination 'exceeding expectations',"The Scottish government has said its Covid vaccination programme is ""exceeding"" expectations New figures revealed 93% of over-80s had received a vaccination by its target date of Friday. In total 786,427 people had received the first dose. A further 48 deaths were registered of people who tested positive in the last 28 days. Daily data also confirmed 895 new cases, 5.9% of those tested. The Scottish Government said at 93% coverage it had met it's target to vaccinate the over 80s by the 5 February.   The other 7% percent included those unable or unwilling to receive the jab.  Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the programme was ""delivering ahead of our expectations"". She added: ""Our aim is to vaccinate as many people as possible with both their first and second doses.  ""The vaccine deployment plan was predicated on an uptake of at least 80% in each cohort - so far we are significantly exceeding that for care home residents and staff, frontline healthcare staff, and over 80-year-olds in the community.  On Friday the Deputy First Minister said Scotland's vaccination programme was ""on track"" to meet its targets. By Saturday morning, those had received their first dose of vaccine included: Figures also showed that 10,332 had received a second dose. Meanwhile, 117 people are in intensive care with recently confirmed Covid - down six since Friday. The total number in hospital fell by 65 to 1,729. Of the new cases, 253 were recorded by NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde, 158 by NHS Lanarkshire and 133 by NHS Lothian. Scotland's national clinical director said the country still has a long way to go but is starting to see the ""green shoots of recovery"" in its fight against the virus. Prof Jason Leitch told BBC Scotland: ""The vaccination programme is moving at a great pace and, globally, compared to much of the rest of the world, it is moving very quickly indeed."" Donald Cameron, of the Scottish Conservatives, welcomed the acceleration in the programme but said some aspects of the scheme have become a ""classic postcode lottery"". The Highlands and Islands MSP added: ""What the SNP government must do is focus their efforts and concentrate on getting this vaccine to the over-70s by the end of next week, which is what their target is. ""We will continue to push them to ensure that target is reached because, ultimately, it causes great anxiety for people who are expecting their vaccine and have yet to hear when it will happen and where it will happen.""

NI records seven more Covid-19 related deaths,"A further seven Covid-19 related deaths have been recorded by the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. The department's coronavirus death toll now stands at 1,922. The latest figures, released on Saturday, also recorded 390 new positive cases of the virus. There are 602 people being treated for Covid-19 in hospitals in Northern Ireland, with 67 of those patients being treated in intensive care units (ICU). Of those in ICU, 59 are ventilated. In the Republic of Ireland, another 55 Covid-related deaths have been reported, bringing the overall death toll there to 3,674. Most of the deaths reported on Saturday happened within the past week, but 18 of them took place in January and have only now been added to official figures.  Within the past 24 hours, another 827 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed, according to Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team. On Friday, Health Minister Robin Swann warned against complacency as the number of people vaccinated against Covid-19 passed 275,000. The Northern Ireland total stands at 301,279 doses administered - 275,232 first doses and 26,047 second doses. But Mr Swann said there could be ""no shortcuts, no rush to any exit door"" from the pandemic.

Ten people dead after care home Covid outbreak,"Ten care home residents have died after a Covid outbreak in Fife. NHS Fife said 25 residents and 43 staff at Mossview Care Home in Lochgelly tested positive for the virus. It was closed to new admissions after the first case was recorded on 20 December. It has now reopened after 14 days without one. The home expressed its sympathies to those who died and described recent weeks as ""extremely difficult"" NHS Fife said its experts worked alongside the Fife health and social care partnership and environmental health to reduce further transmission. In a statement it said: ""NHS Fife is aware of a recent cluster of confirmed Covid-19 cases associated with Mossview Care Home in Lochgelly.  ""Sadly, ten people died after contracting Covid-19 and our thoughts are with their loved ones at this difficult time."" The home confirmed the cases were detected during routine testing and those who died were all residents. A spokesman said: ""We are deeply saddened by these losses and we extend our sympathy to the family members and friends of all those who have lost a loved one. ""Our aim is always to provide the best possible care for our residents, and we pay tribute to our loyal, hard-working and committed employees for continuing to care for our residents at this most difficult time."" The vaccine rollout to care homes began in Scotland on 14 December. On 13 January NHS Fife confirmed the first round of vaccinations had been carried out in all of the region's 76 care homes. The health board said around 5,000 residents and staff were immunised. Across Scotland the latest figures show 99% of residents in older care homes and 93% of all care home residents have now received their first jab.

'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on,"Tributes have been paid on social media in China commemorating a doctor who raised the alarm about the country's coronavirus outbreak, one year after he died with Covid-19. Thousands paid tribute to Li Wenliang ahead of the first anniversary of his death on 7 February 2020. He died after contracting Covid-19 while treating patients in Wuhan. Dr Li had tried to warn fellow medics of a disease that looked like Sars - another deadly coronavirus. But he was told by police to ""stop making false comments"" and was investigated for ""spreading rumours"". Dr Li was an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan - the central Chinese city where the first case of the coronavirus was detected at the end of 2019. Dr Li's death prompted a rare wave of grief and public anger over the Chinese government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. As hospitals filled up in Wuhan, the government was accused of downplaying the severity of the virus and concealing the extent of its spread. Only when anger reached fever pitch was Dr Li exonerated and honoured as a hero by the Chinese government. Since then, more than 105 million people have been infected with coronavirus and 2.3 million have died with Covid-19 worldwide. Freedom of speech is limited in China, where the government has promoted an official narrative hinged on its successful handling of the coronavirus outbreak. China does routinely censor comments on social media. But Dr Li's personal page on Weibo - the Chinese equivalent of Twitter - has become a rare space for users to express themselves about the trauma of the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of messages have been left in the comments section of his posts. Many more appeared on Saturday. ""Dr Li, history and the people will never forget you!,"" one wrote in the comments of Dr Li's final post. ""I thought everyone would have forgotten you after a year,"" another wrote. ""I was wrong, you live forever in the hearts of the Chinese people."" Citizens in Wuhan have also been paying tribute. Close to the hospital where Dr Li worked, Li Pan told Reuters: ""He was the first to tell us about the virus. ""He must have considered the impact would be huge, but he still raised the alarm. That was really brave.""

Worcestershire South Africa variant testing begins,"Testing for the South Africa variant of Covid-19 has begun in Worcestershire.  The county council has set up surge testing in the WR3 postcode, and some parts of WR9, after cases of the variant with no links to international travel were identified. Councillor Tony Miller said the area being tested equated to about 6,000 people. Mr Miller said only one positive case of the variant had so far been found in the area. ""We have done positive tracing and tracking of that person to who they have been in contact with and everybody who has been in contact is self isolating,"" he said. The testing site, he said, would initially be in place for a week, possibly two.  The South Africa variant, one of thousands since Covid-19 emerged, is not thought to be any more dangerous than others circulating in the UK but there are concerns it can spread more readily and vaccines may not work quite as well against it. Cases that cannot be linked to international travel have prompted fears the variant is spreading in communities in England. A mobile testing unit has been set up at The White Hart pub in Fernhill Heath, near Worcester, for adults with no symptoms living within walking distance. But technical problems forced those booked for tests before 12:00 GMT on Saturday to rearrange, which Worcestershire County Council said had affected a quarter of bookings on the first day of testing.  A second testing site will open on Monday at Sixways stadium, also for residents from the identified postcodes, and only for people aged over 18 who have no symptoms.  The council said residents had so far responded ""in their hundreds"" to the request to get tested. Dr Kathryn Cobain, the Director for Public Health in Worcestershire, said:"" I want to thank the residents of these areas for answering our call to get tested, and for fully embracing this testing programme.

Nurse dies with Covid-19 in hospital she worked at,"A ""wonderful, caring"" nurse has died with Covid-19 in the hospital she had worked at for nearly two decades. Estrella Catalan, 52, died on Friday at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH), where she was an emergency department staff nurse. She had been receiving treatment in the hospital's critical care complex. Chief executive of NNUH NHS Foundation Trust, Sam Higginson, said Ms Catalan, who had worked at the hospital since 2002, ""will be terribly missed"". Ms Catalan had previously been interviewed by the BBC from her intensive care bed while she was unwell with Covid-19. Mr Higginson said: ""Our deepest and heartfelt condolences are with Estrella's loved ones and friends at this very difficult time and with all those who worked alongside Estrella and knew her."" He called Ms Catalan a ""wonderful person and a caring and conscientious nurse, who loved to teach and mentor students"" and said they would ""formulate a fitting memorial to Estrella"". ""This is a heartbreaking reminder of the situation we are facing every day to help others and we want to thank our staff for their ongoing courage and commitment during the pandemic,"" added Mr Higginson. According to a GoFundMe page which has raised more than Â£4,700, Ms Catalan is survived by her husband Melvin and their sons John and Josh, and added that her eldest son Vince died two years ago. ""She puts the needs of others first before her own,"" the page said. ""Her selflessness and dedication carried on even when she was on her hospital bed, she still thought and talked about when she could go back to work to help patients and colleagues throughout this pandemic. ""Estrella promised her family, 'I will be back' when she was taken to the hospital few weeks ago... sadly, a promise that she could no longer physically keep.""

" Doubts about the AstraZeneca vaccine: ""Only 8% efficacy on over 65s""","BERLIN - The AstraZeneca vaccine would have an extremely small impact, ie only 8%, on over 65s.The German newspaper Handelsblatt writes, citing the estimates provided by the government.The newspaper deduces from the available data that Germany's vaccination strategy - which had placed high hopes in the approval of the AstraZeneca and Oxford preparation - could thus prove to be a fiasco.Indeed, Astra-Zeneca's vaccine, which unlike Pfizer's does not require storage at extreme temperatures, may be unsuitable for the elderly: according to information obtained by the Handelsblatt, the German government considers that the vaccine is only effective in 'eight percent of the over 65s. A figure that, if confirmed, would mean a strong setback for the strategy prepared by Berlin.The approval of the vaccine in the EU, we remember, was expected in these weeks. Previously, Australia had also had doubts about the effectiveness of the British preparation.Source: https://www.tio.ch/dal-mondo/attualita/1488779/vaccino-astrazeneca-dubbi-over-efficacia",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 What do documents say about Covid-19 vaccines stolen from the EMA,"This stolen data, later posted on the Dark Web, shows the pressure the agency was under to approve the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine as quickly as possible.Lock pointMajor objectionConfidential documents stolen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 9 December 2020 re-emerge on the Dark Web. Le Monde was able to retrieve some and a European team of journalists have reviewed them. The set includes about twenty elements, mainly around the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine evaluation dossier. It also includes 19 emails exchanged between November 10 and November 25 by various agency officials, some of which were allegedly ""manipulated"" by hackers, the EMA has warned Friday, January 15 in a press release. However, in an exchange with Le Monde, the agency acknowledged that ""The e-mails released reflect the problems and discussions that have taken place.""Among the e-mails, which appear duly dated, with the various recipients visible, and therefore a priori less likely to have been manipulated, five allow you to get an idea of ​​the pressure to which the agency was subjected to approve a first vaccine against Covid-19 as quickly as possible. In an exchange on 12 November, an EMA official mentioned, for example, a discussion with the European Commissioner for Health, Stella Kyriakides. She was committed ""to ensure that all member states receive the vaccine at the same time"" and stressed the importance of not ""force them"" to use national procedures due to delays in the official authorization process. According to an EU directive, states can use medicines not authorized by the EMA in the event of an epidemic.On November 19, a senior EMA official also reported on a telephone conference with the European Commission which took place in ""a rather tense atmosphere, sometimes even a bit unpleasant, which gives an idea of ​​what the EMA can expect if expectations are not met, whether those expectations are realistic or not "". The following day, in an exchange with the Danish Medicines Agency, the same official said he was surprised that Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, had ""clearly identified the two vaccines that could be approved before the end of the year [Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna]. There are still problems with both.""the official said.Some of these ""problems"" are addressed in other documents stolen in December 2020, which are not suspected of being manipulated by the EMA. In particular, the problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. In November, the EMA raised three ""main objections"" to the vaccine: some production sites had not yet been inspected; data on commercial batches of the vaccine were still missing; and most importantly, the available data revealed qualitative differences between commercial batches and those used in clinical trials. It is on this last point that the evaluators seemed most concerned.Indeed, to move from the clinical to the commercial stage, manufacturers have had to change their manufacturing processes and have also invested in new production lines and new plants. These changes would explain differences in the exact composition of vaccines, in particular a decrease in the degree of RNA integrity. RNA is the crucial component of the vaccine which, once injected into cells, makes it possible to produce the Spike protein of the virus, thus teaching the immune system to recognize and neutralize this pathogen. Vaccines used in clinical trials had between 69% and 81% ""intact"" RNA, the entire sequence that makes up the Spike protein. In contrast, data on batches produced on these new production lines showed lower percentages, on average 59%. Some lots have dropped as high as 51% and 52%. A ""tipping point,"" the EMA said on November 23.One wonders if this lower RNA level could not only affect vaccination efficacy but also its safety, because less RNA means more impurities, especially truncated RNA. ""We often have slightly shorter or slightly longer RNA in these products. We filter according to the size of the molecule, but this filtration is difficult on a large scale,"" comments Steve Pascolo, a researcher at the University Hospital of Zurich, who has been working for 20 years. years on RNA vaccines (co-founder of CureVac in 2000, left the company, and now has joint projects with BioNTech). These truncated RNAs obviously can no longer be translated into Spike proteins. However, data provided by the manufacturer to the EMA indicates that with a complete RNA rate of 62%, the protein is still produced in comparable quantities. In the first trials of BioNTech, they had immune responses with just one microgram of RNA, ""says Pascolo. Now the vaccine should have 30 micrograms, so they have some room for improvement.""This is also the opinion of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with which the EMA was in contact. ""The messenger RNA content issue is not seen as a major issue"" for the FDA, explains an EMA official in an email dated November 23. It actually appears in this message that these manufacturing and quality control issues are not about emergency use authorizations (implemented by the US, Canada or the UK). These do not actually constitute an authorization for the vaccine itself, but an authorization for its temporary use. The temporary marketing authorization targeted by the EMA appears to be more restrictive on this point. Hence the need to ""align with common specifications"" at the EMA, the FDA and the Canadian agency, ""to prevent a region from getting all the suboptimal material,"" reads an e-mail.On November 26, BioNTech and Pfizer have a chance to respond to EMA's objections. Inspections of the various sites are underway, their presentation reads. They also propose to raise the minimum RNA integrity level to 60% in the early manufacturing stages to avoid dropping below 50% in the final product, which appears as an acceptance criterion in all documents consulted. In their presentation, the manufacturers of this Comirnaty vaccine state that these differences in the amount of RNA ""shouldn't affect"" either the efficacy or safety of their product. Some of these lots have been used in clinical studies.But the EMA still does not seem convinced, as the latest documents or exchanges available do not yet allow to remove this ""important objection"". A screenshot of an e-mail exchanged on November 30 between the EMA and the manufacturers confirms this: ""These problems are considered critical, especially in the context of the novelty of this type of product and the limited experience, therefore a control strategy is envisaged. more rigorous "". However, one of the latest reports available indicates that by adjusting manufacturing processes, integrity levels of approximately 75% can be restored, comparable to clinical trial batches.Three days later, on December 3, the Wall Street Journal published an article reporting a manufacturing problem with Pfizer's vaccine. ""Some first batches of raw materials were substandard. We solved the problem, but we ran out of time to meet shipments scheduled for this year,"" explained a ""person directly involved in Pfizer's vaccine development."" Is there a connection? Pfizer declined to comment, citing only the ongoing EMA investigation into the cyber attack. On Friday 15 January, BioNTech and Pfizer again announced delays in deliveries, citing necessary works at the Belgian plant in Puurs.Upon request, EMA confirmed that this quality issue was subsequently resolved: ""The company was able to address these issues and provide the information and data necessary to enable EMA to move towards a positive recommendation for this vaccine. "". The agency also assures that current RNA level specifications ""are considered scientifically justified and acceptable"". It is, for example, unlikely, the agency points out, that these truncated RNA molecules could be translated into a protein or peptide and thus cause adverse effects. ""Despite the urgency, there has always been a consensus across the EU not to compromise high quality standards and to base any recommendations on the strength of scientific evidence, safety, quality and efficacy of a vaccine,"" and nothing else "", insists the EMA. The European Commission also responded to our request, stating that these discussions ""have never undermined the independence of the Agency and have never interfered in any way with the integrity of EMA's mission regarding the evaluation of vaccine candidates. or other medicinal products "".Source: https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2021/01/16/vaccins-ce-que-disent-les-documents-voles-a-l-agence-europeenne-des-medicaments_6066502_3244.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 WHO inspector caught on camera revealing coronavirus manipulation in Wuhan before the pandemic,"Verifying sources is why we tend to approve fewer posts than other groups similar to ours. Being precise outweighs the need to give the news at all costs and to be precise it is necessary to verify the news as far as possible.Taiwan News is an English-language news site and former Taiwanese newspaper founded, under a different name, in 1949. The current publisher is a food company called I-Mei Foods. When news comes from a Taiwanese media, it should be remembered that it was Taiwan that came into sharp contrast with the WHO and the Chinese Communist Party at the beginning of the pandemic, given that they were the first to warn WHO of the outbreak of a ' epidemic in China recognizing doubts about the Chinese actions and the coverage of the WHO itself. It should also be remembered that China, or rather the Chinese Communist Party, which is one of the first donors of the WHO, has waged a bitter internal war on the UN agency to keep Taiwan out of the WHO precisely because of Taiwan's accusations on the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.After this preamble, here's the news:AIPEI (Taiwan News) - A video taken a few days before the coronavirus pandemic starts shows a current World Health Organization (WHO) inspector discussing modified coronavirus testing on human cells and humanized mice at the Wuhan Institute of Virology ( WIV), just weeks before the first cases of COVID-19 were announced in the same city of Wuhan.In a video that was originally recorded on December 9, 2019, three weeks before the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission announced an outbreak of a new form of pneumonia, virologist Vincent Racaniello interviewed British zoologist and EcoHealth Alliance chair Peter Daszak about the his work at the nonprofit to protect the world from the emergence of new diseases and predict pandemics. Since 2014, Daszak's organization has received millions of dollars in funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), which it channeled to WIV to carry out research on bat coronaviruses.In the first phase of the research, which took place from 2014 to 2019, Daszak coordinated with Shi Zhengli, (石正麗), also known as ""Bat Woman"", at WIV to investigate and catalog bat coronaviruses across China. EcoHealth Alliance received $ 3,7 million in funding from the NIH for this research, and 10% was channeled to WIV, he reported. NPR.The second, more dangerous phase, which began in 2019, involved gain-of-function (GoF) research on coronaviruses and chimeras in humanized mice from the University of North Carolina's Ralph S. Baric laboratory. Funding for the program was withdrawn from the NIH under the Trump administration on April 27 amid the pandemic.At 28:10 minute of the interview, Daszak says that the researchers found that SARS likely originated in bats and then searched for other SARS-related coronaviruses, eventually finding over 100 of them. He noted that some coronaviruses they can ""enter human cells in the laboratory"" and others can cause SARS disease in ""humanized mouse models"".He ominously warned that such coronaviruses are ""not treatable with therapeutic monoclonals [antibodies] and cannot be vaccinated against them with a vaccine."" Ironically, he claims his team's goal was to try to find the next ""relapse event"" that could cause the next pandemic, just weeks before COVID-19 cases began to be reported in Wuhan.When Racaniello asks what can be done to tackle coronaviruses, given that there is no vaccine or therapy for them, Daszak at 29:54 seems to reveal that the goal of the GoF experiments was to develop a pan-coronavirus vaccine for many different types of coronaviruses.Based on his response, it is evident that just before the pandemic began, WIV was modifying coronaviruses in the laboratory. ""You can manipulate them in the laboratory quite easily"". What he later mentioned became the telltale trait of SARS-CoV-2, its spike protein: ""The spike protein drives much of what happens with the coronavirus, the zoonotic risk"".Daszak mentions WIV's collaboration with Baric: ""and we work with Ralph Baric at UNC [University of North Carolina] to do this."" As has been suggested by supporters that SARS-CoV-2 is a laboratory chimera, he talks about inserting the spike protein ""in a backbone of another virus"" and then do ""some lab work"".Providing evidence of the creation of chimeras for the sake of a vaccine, he says, ""Now, the logical progression for vaccines is, if you are going to develop a SARS vaccine, people will use pandemic SARS, but let's try to include these other ones. related diseases and getting a better vaccine. ""Based on Daszak's statements, it appears that shortly before the pandemic began, WIV was using GoF experiments with chimeras in an attempt to create a vaccine. These experiments appear to have included the infection of mice genetically change to express the human ACE2 protein with these chimeras.In a presentation Entitled ""Assessing Coronavirus Threats,"" delivered four years before the 2015 pandemic, Daszak points out that experiments involving humanized mice have the highest degree of risk. Demonstrating his close ties to WIV, he also listed the lab as a collaborator at the end of the presentation.(Assessing Coronavirus threats, Peter Daszak image)Controversially, Daszak was included in a WHO team of experts that was finally cleared by Beijing to investigate the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak, more than a year after it began. Scientists like Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in New Jersey, are condemning Daszak's participation due to conflicts of interest ""which unequivocally disqualify him from being part of an investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic"", reports the Daily Mail.In light of the WHO trip to Wuhan, a researcher carrying the pseudonym of Billy Bostickson and his colleagues at DRASTIC (Decentralized Radical Autonomous Search Team Investigating COVID-19) have created a petition asking the international investigation team to answer 50 key questions about the Wuhan outbreak. Among the questions is a request to access the facility's database and laboratory records, which are expected to be 20 years old and include a look at its security procedures, security audit reports, and security incident reports .Source: https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4104828",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

" ""I saw the vaccine contract"", French MEP throws the bomb on side effects","Un contract full of omission and ""buried"" in a Brussels room with strict access rules.

I took a six-hour train ride to this reading room. There is nothing on the figures ""granted to producers""; on the places of production, there is nothing; on prices, there is nothing "". In reality, the latter are partly known thanks to a tweet, which dates back to December, by the Belgian undersecretary Eva de Bleeker, who in the heat of a controversy on Twitter with the rivals of the N-Va broke the secret requested by the multinationals and granted by the Commission. The undersecretary then deleted the tweet, complete with a table, but it was screenshot and published by a Flemish newspaper. According to the table published by De Bleeker, never denied by the Commission, the vaccine from Pfizer and BionTech costs the EU 12 euros per dose, just under $ 18 (about 14,7 euros) per dose of Moderna's vaccine. The Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine is the cheapest (1,78 euros per dose). For Curevac it is 10 euros per dose, for Sanofi / Gsk it is 7,56 euros, for Johnson & Johnson 8,5 dollars per dose.But besides the price, there are many data that are not disclosed.

 Peter Doshi: Pfizer and Moderna vaccines “95% effective” - we need more details and raw data.,"""Suspected covid-19""The 371 individuals excluded from the Pfizer vaccine efficacy analysis. Pain and fever medications, unmasking and primary event assessment committees.  Effectiveness of vaccination in people who have already had Covid?We need raw data.Five weeks ago, when I raised questions about the results of Pfizer and Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine tests, all that was in the public domain was the study protocols and some press releases. Today, two papers and approximately 400 pages of summary data are available in the form of multiple reports submitted by and to the FDA prior to the agency's release of each company's mRNA vaccine for emergency authorization. While some of the additional details are reassuring, others are not. Here I outline new concerns about the reliability and significance of the reported efficacy results.Attention was totally focused on the excellent efficacy results: Pfizer reported 170 cases of Covid-19, divided into 8 in the group of vaccinated subjects and 162 among those assigned to placebo. But these numbers were reduced by a category called “Covid-19 suspects” - that is, those with Covid-19 symptoms not confirmed by the PCR test. According to Pfizer's FDA vaccine report, there were 3410 total cases of 'suspected but unconfirmed Covid-19' in the overall study population and of these 1594 occurred in the vaccine group versus 1816 in the placebo group. With 20 times more suspected cases than confirmed cases, this category of sufferers cannot be ignored simply because there was no positive PCR test result.  Indeed, this makes understanding even more urgent. A rough estimate of the vaccine's effectiveness against developing Covid-19 symptoms, with or without a positive PCR test result, would represent a 19% relative risk reduction (see footnote) - far below the 50% effectiveness threshold required by regulatory authorities for authorization.Even after removing cases that occurred within seven days of vaccination (409 on Pfizer vaccine vs 287 on placebo), which should include most of the symptoms due to short-term vaccine reactogenicity, the efficacy of the vaccine remains low and reaches 29%. (see footnotes).If many or most of these suspected cases had occurred in people who had a false positive result on the PCR test, this would imply a dramatic reduction in the effectiveness of the vaccine. But considering that flu-like illnesses have always had a variety of causes - rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, other coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, etc. - some or many of the suspected covid-19 cases could be attributable to different causative agents. .But why should etiology be considered? If ""suspected covid-19"" had essentially the same clinical course as confirmed covid-19 cases, then ""suspected plus confirmed"" could be a more significant clinical endpoint than confirmed Covid-19 cases alone.However, if the confirmed cases were on average more serious than the suspected cases, we would still have to consider that in the end it is not the average clinical severity that is relevant, but the incidence of hospitalizations.With 20 times more suspected cases than confirmed, and with trials not designed to assess whether vaccines can stop viral transmission, an analysis of disease severity regardless of causative agent - i.e., hospitalization rates, ICU cases and deaths among study participants - seems the least to be done, and is the only way to assess the true ability of vaccines to contain the pandemic.Clearly data is needed to answer these questions, but Pfizer's 92-page report did not mention the 3410 cases of suspected Covid-19. Not even its publication on the New England Journal of Medicine. Nor any of the reports on the Moderna vaccine. The only source that appears to have reported this is the FDA review of the Pfizer vaccine.Another reason we need more data is to analyze an inexplicable detail identified in a table in the FDA review of the Pfizer vaccine: 371 individuals were excluded from the efficacy analysis for ""major deviations from the protocol within or before 7 days after the second dose "". What is worrying is the imbalance between the randomized groups in the number of these individuals excluded: 311 from the vaccine group versus 60 from the placebo. (In contrast, in the Moderna trials only 36 participants were excluded from the efficacy analysis for ""important protocol deviations"" - 12 vaccine group vs 24 placebo group.)What were these protocol deviations in Pfizer's study and why were five times as many vaccine group participants excluded? The FDA report doesn't say so, and these exclusions are hard to spot even in Pfizer's report and journal publication.  Last month, I expressed my concern about the potential confounding role of pain relievers and antipyretics to treat symptoms. I have speculated that some drugs may mask symptoms, leading to under-detection of Covid-19 cases, probably more among people who have received the vaccine in an attempt to prevent or treat adverse events. However, it seems that this ability to confuse the results is quite limited: even if the results indicate that these medicines were taken between 3 and 4 times more in the vaccine group than in the placebo group (at least as regards Pfizer vaccine, Moderna did not clearly highlight this in the report), their use was presumably concentrated in the first week after vaccine administration, in order to soothe local adverse events at the injection site and systemic ones.But the cumulative incidence curves indicate a fairly constant rate of confirmed cases of covid-19, with symptom onset dates extending well beyond a week after administration.That said, the higher rate of drug use in the vaccinated arm provides more than one cause for concern about unofficial exposure.Given the reactogenicity of vaccines, it is difficult to imagine that the participants and investigators did not imagine what group they were in.The primary endpoint in trials is quite subjective, making double-blind an important issue. But, neither the FDA nor the companies appear to have formally probed the reliability of the double-blind procedure, and its effect in the reported results.We also don't know enough about the processes of the primary event assessment boards that counted the covid-19 cases.Were they in the dark about the information about the patients' antibody titers and symptoms in the first week after vaccination? What criteria did they use and why, with a primary event consisting of a patient-reported outcome (Covid-19 symptoms) and PCR test result, was this kind of committee even necessary? It is also important to understand who was on these committees. Although Moderna has appointed its four-member evaluation committee - all university-affiliated doctors - Pfizer's protocol states that 3 Pfizer employees have worked there. Yes, Pfizer staff members.Individuals with known prior SARS-CoV-2 infection or a previous diagnosis of Covid 19 were excluded from the Moderna and Pfizer studies. Yet, 1125 (3,0%) and 675 (2,2%) participants in the Moderna and Pfizer trials, respectively, were considered positive at baseline.The safety and efficacy of the vaccine in these participants has not received much attention, but as ever larger portions of the population of many countries may be ""post-Covid"", these data seem important - and all the more so because the US CDC recommends offer the vaccine “regardless of history of previous symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection”.This ties in with the agency's conclusions regarding the Pfizer vaccine having a ≥92% efficacy and ""no particular safety concern"" in people with previous cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection.According to my calculations, Pfizer reported 8 cases of symptomatic confirmed Covid-19 in people positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the start of the trial (1 in the vaccine group, 7 in the placebo group, according to the differences between Tables 9 and 10) and Moderna, 1 case (placebo group, table 12). But with only 4 to 31 documented reinfections globally, how could there be nine confirmed cases of Covid-19 among those infected with SARS-CoV-2 at the start of the trial, in studies of tens of thousands, with a follow-up median up of two months? Is this representative of significant vaccine efficacy, as the CDC appears to have claimed? Or could it be something else, like preventing Covid-19 symptoms, possibly with the vaccine or the use of drugs that suppress symptoms, and nothing to do with re-infection? ""Addressing the many open questions about these studies requires access to raw data. But no company seems to have shared the data with third parties so far.Pfizer says it will make the data available ""on request and subject to review"". This avoids making the data publicly available, but at least leaves the door open. How open is unclear, as the study protocol says Pfizer will begin making data available 24 months after the studies are completed.Moderna's statement on data sharing states that “data may be available upon request once the study is completed”. This translates into the second half of 2022, as the follow-up is scheduled for two years.Things may be no different for the Oxford / AstraZeneca vaccine which promised patient data ""when the study is complete."" And for the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, ClinicalTrials.gov says there is no planned sharing of participant data.However, the European Medicines Agency and Health Canada may share data for any vaccine authorized much earlier. EMA has already committed to publishing the data submitted by Pfizer on its website ""in due course"", as has Health Canada.Peter Doshi, associate editor, The BMJConflicts of interest: I have dedicated myself to public release of vaccine testing protocols and co-signed open letters calling for independence and transparency in the decision-making process related to the covid-19 vaccine.Footnotes.The calculations in this article are as follows: 19% = 1 - (8 + 1594) / (162 + 1816); 29% = 1 - (8 + 1594 - 409) / (162 + 1816 - 287) I ignored the denominators as they are similar in groups.Peter DoshiSource: https://blogs.bmj.com/bmj/2021/01/04/peter-doshi-pfizer-and-modernas-95-effective-vaccines-we-need-more-details-and-the-raw-data/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Sinovac: Brazil results show Chinese vaccine is 50,4% effective","A coronavirus vaccine developed by China's Sinovac was found to be 50,4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials, according to the latest results released by the researchers. From what we learn from the media, assessing that we struggle to read Chinese and give you official Beijing sources, this would be an inactivated vaccine. It works by using ""killed"" viral particles, therefore more ""classic"" as a vaccine.The researchers, speaking of the effectiveness of this vaccine, mean the prevention of mild to severe cases, therefore it can be understood as an anti-Covid-19 vaccine.Also on this vaccine we have some numbers, few but interesting:There have been concerns and criticisms that Chinese vaccine trials are not subject to the same scrutiny and levels of transparency as its Western counterparts, for example Brazil had stopped the Chinese vaccine trial after a series of serious adverse reactions.Source:",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Decree law January 5, 2021: Tso authorized?","It seems that in the latest decree published in the official gazette there is a nasty surprise for all those who believe in the fundamental right to freedom of therapeutic choice: in defiance of the law on informed consent, the possibility of acting against the will expressed by the patient or his guardian!We are talking about the DL n.1 of January 5, 2021, which you can read in full here, on the Official Gazette website.In our opinion, the contents of Article 5 are very serious, which should cause more than a concern in all those who have among their loved ones people who reside in health facilities (including the famous RSAs) and residences for the elderly.Here we describe what precautions are imposed in the vaccination proposal for Covid-19. There is a great deal, initially, of informed consent, also recalling the specific law that we remember being the 219 of 2017.it is also specified that:All right, you will say ... The problems come later, when we start talking about what can happen in case of refusal of the proposed vaccination (by the person concerned or by the neighbor, relative, guardian, etc.). Article 4 continues: Sorry, but we are talking about the possibility of imposing the vaccine even against the will of the person concerned and his representatives ???We remind you that the vaccine against Covid-19 is an experimental product, provided with only ""emergency"" authorization, conditioned on the data that will be collected in the coming years. It is not a ""cure"" and does not present to date a certain and incontrovertibly established safety profile, just as its effectiveness or duration over time is not guaranteed !!! But that's not all, unfortunately: the tutelary judge has well (so to speak) 48 hours to validate or deny the validation of the vaccination request. Another 48h is the limit set for the communication of this validation or denial; but after these terms, note what happens:In conclusion, we see a very serious danger especially for those elderly people hospitalized in nursing homes, hospices, retirement homes: not only have they been deprived for months of the opportunity to entertain themselves and receive regular visits from close relatives; not only had it already been decreed that it was impossible to ask for their resignation during the emergency, now they are being taken as the target of ""consents"" that are not at all such! The spouse, the child, whoever represents the family and close relatives, even in the event of refusal, can have their loved one vaccinated, perhaps even against their wishes, by direct decision of the manager or health manager, if not by the manager Asl, who may not even know the person concerned ...Unfortunately, we have no advice to be able to defend you from this drift, other than to monitor carefully, always be available and try to obtain information about it, also contacting a lawyer if unclear maneuvers are suspected. It is very serious that we are looking for a way to bypass the wills of people who, it was decided, must instead be subjected to experimentation, moreover recalling the same law that should have protected them.We close with the hope that this sad chapter of history will end as soon as possible.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Pfizer's vaccine raises allergy problems,"The polymer in the mRNA ""packaging"" can cause rare anaphylactic reactionsScience 01 Jan 2021: Vol. 371, Issue 6524, pp. 10-11 DOI: 10.1126 / science.371.6524.10By Jop de VriezeScience's COVID-19 report is supported by the Pulitzer Center and the Heising-Simons Foundation.Serious allergic reactions in at least 12 people who received the COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech could be due to a compound in the messenger RNA (mRNA) package that makes up the vaccine's main ingredient, the scientists say. A similar mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna also contains the compound, polyethylene glycol (PEG).PEG has never been used in vaccines before, but is part of many medications, some of which have occasionally triggered anaphylaxis, a life-threatening reaction that can cause skin rashes, a drop in blood pressure, shortness of breath, and a heartbeat fast. Some allergists and immunologists believe that a small number of people previously exposed to PEG may have high levels of antibodies against it, putting them at risk for an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.Others are skeptical of the link. However, the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) worried enough to call several meetings last month to discuss reactions with independent scientists, doctors, representatives from Pfizer and Moderna, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ). The NIAID is also initiating a collaborative study with the FDA to analyze vaccine response in people who have high levels of anti-PEG antibodies or who have already had severe allergic responses to drugs or vaccines. ""Until we know that there is indeed a history of PEG, we have to be very careful to talk about this as a done deal,"" said Alkis Togias, branch chief of allergy, asthma and airway biology at NIAID.Pfizer also says it is ""actively seeking follow-up."" An e-mailed statement to Science pointed out that it is already recommended that ""appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available"" in the event that a vaccine develops anaphylaxis.Reports of allergic reactions have created anxiety among potential recipients of the vaccine. ""Allergies in general are so common in the population that this could create resistance to vaccines in the population,"" says Janos Szebeni, an immunologist at Semmelweis University in Budapest, Hungary, who has extensively studied hypersensitivity reactions to PEG.Anaphylactic reactions can occur with any vaccine, but are extremely rare - about one in every 1 million doses. As of December 23, 2020, the United States had seen 10 cases of anaphylaxis among 614.117 people who had received the COVID-19 vaccine; the UK had registered two. Because the Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines use new technology, the reactions require careful scrutiny, said Elizabeth Phillips, a drug hypersensitivity researcher at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, who attended a NIAID meeting on December 16. ""This is new"".Clinical trials of vaccines, involving tens of thousands of people, have found no serious adverse events caused by the vaccine. But both studies excluded people with a history of allergies to COVID-19 vaccine components; Pfizer also excluded those who previously had a severe adverse reaction from any vaccine.The two COVID-19 vaccines both contain mRNA wrapped in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that help transport it to human cells, but also act as an adjuvant, a vaccine ingredient that boosts the immune response. LNPs are ""PEGylated"" - chemically attached to PEG molecules which cover the outside of the particles and increase their lifespan.PEGs are also used in everyday products such as toothpaste and shampoos as thickeners, solvents and fabric softeners, and have been used in laxatives for decades. An increasing number of biopharmaceuticals also include PEGylated compounds.Compounds have long been thought to be biologically inert, but it is increasingly evident that they are not. Up to 72 percent of people have at least some antibodies to PEGs, according to a 2016 study by Samuel Lai, a pharmaceutical engineer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, presumably as a result of exposure to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. About 7% have a high enough level to predispose them to anaphylactic reactions, he found. ""Some companies have dropped PEGylated products from their pipeline as a result,"" Lai says. But he notes that the safety record of many PEGylated drugs has convinced others that ""concerns about anti-PEG antibodies are overrated.""Szebeni says the mechanism behind PEG-conjugated anaphylaxis is relatively unknown because it doesn't involve immunoglobulin E (IgE), the type of antibody that causes classic allergic reactions. Instead, PEG triggers two other classes of antibodies, IgM and IgG, involved in a branch of the body's innate immunity called the complement system, which Szebeni has spent decades studying.In 1999, while working at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Szebeni described a new type of drug-induced reaction he dubbed complement activation-related pseudo-allergy (CARPA), a non-specific immune response to nanoparticle-based drugs. often PEGylates, which are mistakenly recognized by the immune system as a virus. He believes CARPA explains the severe anaphylactoid reactions occasionally caused by certain PEGylated drugs, including the cancer blockbuster Doxil and pegnivacogin, an experimental coagulant whose phase III trial was stopped in 2014 after some participants developed severe allergic responses and one is dead.Some scientists believe that PEGylated nanoparticles can cause problems through a mechanism other than CARPA. In November, Phillips and colleagues published a paper showing that people who suffered an anaphylactic reaction to PEGylated drugs had IgE antibodies against PEG after all, suggesting these may be involved, rather than IgG and IgM. Other scientists are not at all convinced that PEG is involved. ""There are a lot of exaggerations when it comes to the risk of PEG and CARP,"" says Moein Moghimi, a researcher in nanomedicine at Newcastle University who suspects a more conventional mechanism is causing the reactions. ""You are giving an adjuvant at the injection site to stimulate the local immune system. It happens that some people experience too much stimulation, because they have a relatively high number of local immune cells.""Others note that the amount of PEG in mRNA vaccines is in the order of magnitude less than in most PEGylated drugs. And while these drugs are often given intravenously, the two COVID-19 vaccines are injected into a muscle, leading to delayed exposure and a much lower level of PEG in the blood, where most antibodies are found. anti-PEG.However, the vaccine companies were aware of the risk. In a 2018 stock market prospectus, Moderna recognized the possibility of ""reactions to the PEG from certain lipids or PEGs otherwise associated with LNP."" And in a September article, BioNTech researchers proposed an alternative to PEG for delivering therapeutic mRNA, noting, ""PEGylation of nanoparticles can also have significant disadvantages with regards to activity and safety."" Katalin Karikó, an mRNA vaccine pioneer and senior vice president of BioNTech, said she discussed with Szebeni whether the PEG in the vaccine could be a problem. They agreed that, given the low amount of lipids and intramuscular administration, the risk was negligible. Karikó pointed out that, based on what we know so far, the risk is still low. ""All vaccines carry some risk. But the benefit of the vaccine outweighs the risk,"" he says.Scientists who believe PEG may be the culprit agree, and stress that vaccination should continue. ""We need to get vaccinated,"" says Phillips. ""We must try to limit this pandemic."" But more data on side effects is needed, he adds: ""These next few weeks in the US will be extremely important in defining what to do next.""",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 CDC: First data on the side effects of the Covid-19 vaccine,"The first data published by the US CDC on 19 December 2020, which refer to the vaccination campaign in the UK, do not seem to promise anything good. We remind you that starting from 8 December in England began the administration of the vaccine, not yet in possession of the marketing authorization, produced by the Pfizer company.Out of 112.807 administrations as of December 18, 2020, as you can see below, 3.150 were the severe reactions that determined ""inability to perform normal daily activities, inability to work, and needed medical or health care.""In practice, 2,8% of vaccine recipients reported disabling health problems, so much so that he is unable to work or carry out even the slightest normal activities in daily life. The report actually focuses in particular on the 6 anaphylactic reactions reported so far, citing the actions taken by the CDC in this regard: coordination with the FDA, discussions with experts, control agencies and other subjects ""in the field"", the publication of a document containing considerations on the management of the risk of anaphylaxis in vaccination centers (which you find here) ...But in the report another discordant note also emerges: there are 514 pregnancies in progress in vaccinated, which is not an indifferent number for a vaccine that has been contraindicated for pregnant women, and after which it is not recommended to start a pregnancy for at least three months after administration (according to the recommendations of the British JCVI vaccination committee). It must have been an accident, an oversight, or rather 514 oversights, the fact is that the vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy and breastfeeding, yet it was evidently administered to pregnant women. In fact, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization (JCVI) English published his remarks updated to December 3, before the start of the vaccine administration in the country, and reports:Pregnancy - There are still no data on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy, either from human or animal studies. Given the lack of evidence, JCVI favors a precautionary approach and currently does not recommend COVID-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Women should be advised not to come forward for vaccination if they may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant within three months of the first dose. Data is expected to inform discussions on vaccination in pregnancy. JCVI will review them as they become available.Here, let's say that soon these data will be available, at least for 514 cases. We recall that, however, pharmacokinetic studies are never conducted, indeed it is better to say that they are never reported, as they are not required for the authorization of vaccines that are defined as ""ethical"" drugs. However, the CDC surprisingly included pregnant women among the subjects who should receive the vaccine (according to their will, their goodness), in its December 12 document.

" Usa, reported severe allergic reaction to Pfizer vaccine","A US health worker who was given Pfizer and Biontech's coronavirus vaccine developed a severe allergic reaction, but her condition is now stable. This was reported by the ""New York Times"", which cites health sources from Barlett Regional Hospital in Juneau, Alaska, where the health worker works and where she received the vaccine.The newspaper noted that the subject had no history of allergies, but nevertheless developed a severe allergic reaction 10 minutes after the drug was administered. The woman received the first dose of Pfizer and Biontech's vaccine in front of cameras on December 11, as part of the government campaign to promote ""trust in vaccines"" among US citizens.The woman developed skin rashes, tachycardia and a respiratory crisis, and was given epinephrine to ease the symptoms, but they returned, and they forced the treating doctors to also use steroids. A further aggravation forced him to be admitted to intensive care.Medical sources report that the woman ""feels good and is enthusiastic about the vaccine"".

" AstraZeneca, under fire for vaccine safety","Experts are concerned that the company has not been transparent about two participants who became seriously ill after testing its experimental vaccine.Polls are finding that Americans are increasingly cautious about accepting a coronavirus vaccine. Scientists inside and outside the government are concerned that regulators under pressure may release an unproven or unsafe vaccine.Experts are particularly concerned about AstraZeneca's vaccine studies, which began in April in Britain, due to the company's refusal to provide details on serious neurological diseases in two participants, both women, who received the experimental vaccine. These cases prompted the company to stop testing twice, the second time earlier this month. Studies have resumed in Great Britain, Brazil, India and South Africa, but are still on hiatus in the United States. About 18.000 people around the world have received AstraZeneca's vaccine so far.AstraZeneca's 111-page trial project, known as the protocol, says its target is a vaccine with a 50% efficacy - the same threshold that the Food and Drug Administration has set in its guidelines for vaccines against the drug. coronavirus. To determine with statistical certainty whether the company has achieved that goal, there will need to be 150 people with confirmed coronavirus among participants who have been vaccinated or received placebo.However, the plan foresees that a safety commission will carry out an early investigation after there have been only 75 cases. If the vaccine is 50% effective at that point, it may be possible for the company to stop the trial early and seek government authorization to release the vaccine for emergency use.In allowing only one of these interim analyzes, AstraZeneca's plan is more rigorous than the others that have been released, by Moderna and PfizerDr. Eric Topol, a clinical studies expert at Scripps Research in San Diego, said in an interview. Moderna allows two such analyzes, and Pfizer four.The problem with looking at the data too many times, after a relatively small number of cases, is that it increases the chances of finding an aspect of safety and efficacy that may not hold up. Stopping trials early can also increase the risk of missing rare side effects that could be significant once millions of people are given the vaccine.Dr Topol said AstraZeneca's plan, like those of Moderna and Pfizer, had a problematic feature: They all count relatively mild cases of Covid-19 when measuring efficacy, which may hinder efforts to determine whether the vaccine prevents. moderate or severe illness.Such plans are not usually shared with the public ""because of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of trials,"" said Michele Meixell, spokesperson for AstraZeneca, in a statement.The company has released few details on the two cases of serious illness in its trial. The first participant received a dose of the vaccine before developing inflammation of the spinal cord known as transverse myelitis, according to a participant information sheet for the July AstraZeneca vaccine. The condition can cause weakness in the arms and legs, paralysis, pain, and bowel and bladder problems.The case called for a pause in AstraZeneca's vaccine trials to allow for a safety review by independent experts. A company spokesperson told the Times last week that the volunteer was later determined to have a previously undiagnosed, vaccine-related case of multiple sclerosis, and that the trial resumed shortly thereafter.Transverse myelitis can sometimes be the first sign of multiple sclerosis, involving more complex symptoms. But myelitis alone can also occur after the body encounters an infectious agent such as a virus.The company said it did not confirm the diagnosis in the second case, a participant who fell ill after the second dose of the vaccine. A person familiar with the situation, who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, said the participant's disease had been identified as transverse myelitis. The trial was suspended again on 6 September after she fell ill.The condition is rare, but serious, and experts said finding even one case among thousands of trial participants could be a wake-up call. More confirmed cases, they said, may be enough to stop AstraZeneca's vaccine offering altogether.A participant fact sheet dated 11 September about the AstraZeneca trial in Britain combined the two volunteers' cases, stating that the diseases were ""unlikely to be associated with the vaccine or there was not enough evidence to say for sure that the diseases were or were not related to the vaccine, ""based on safety reviews. The next day, AstraZeneca announced that it had resumed testing in the UK.But the FDA has so far not allowed the company to restart the trial in the United States.An FDA spokesperson declined to comment. The National Institutes of Health said in a statement that ""it remains to be seen"" whether the onset of the disease in trial participants was random or vaccine-related, adding that ""a pause to allow for further evaluation is consistent with practice. standard"".Dr. Mark Goldberger, an infectious disease expert at the Global Antibiotic Research and Development Partnership and a former FDA official, said he found the rapid resumption of overseas trials ""a little disturbing,"" especially given the lack of of details about the patients' symptoms and the ambiguity about their link to the vaccine. ""Maybe this is the best they could do - it may not be possible to get more certainty right now,"" he said. ""It's a question mark about what's going on.The company did not immediately notify the public of both participants' neurological problems. Nor did he promptly warn the FDA that he was again pausing his experiments after the second UK volunteer developed a disease and an independent safety committee called for a temporary suspension, according to several people who knew the situation. The CEO of the company informed investors of the problems, but did not speak about it publicly until the information leaked and was reported by the STAT.""The communication around it has been horrifying and unacceptable,"" said Dr. Peter Jay Hotez, a virologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""This is not how the American people should hear about it.""Dr Hotez also criticized statements made by government officials, including UK regulators who, he said, did not provide a rationale for resuming their trials.Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the FDA's Vaccine Advisory Committee, said it is unclear how the company - or the UK government - determined that the second case was unrelated to the vaccine.He and other experts noted that transverse myelitis is rare, diagnosed in only about one in 236.000 Americans per year. The trial in Great Britain involved only around 8.000 volunteers.The vaccine developed by AstraZeneca, which has formed a partnership with scientists at the University of Oxford, uses a virus intended to carry coronavirus genes into human cells and trigger an immune response that will protect people from the coronavirus. This so-called vector is a modified form of adenovirus that causes the common cold in chimpanzees, but it is considered safe for people. Several other companies, including Johnson & Johnson and CanSino, are pursuing similar adenovirus-based approaches, although there are different types of adenoviruses and the specific ingredients differ from one vaccine to another.While other adenovirus-based products have had some success in the past, they have also been linked to serious adverse events. The most famous was the case of 1999-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who died in XNUMX after receiving gene therapy through an adenovirus that triggered a lethal inflammatory response from his immune system.If a serious side effect were permanently linked to AstraZeneca's vaccine, scientists would need to determine whether its trigger is from the adenovirus vector or perhaps the coronavirus genes it carries, connections that could raise concerns about other companies' products that rely on it. on the same components.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Two cases of neurological complications, AstraZeneca vaccine tests still stopped in the US","New complications for monkey adenovirus-based vaccine developed by AstraZeneca. Tests stopped in the USA, while the consequences of this new technology remain uncertain.Uncertainties about the technology used by AstraZenecaA few days after AstraZeneca announced that clinical trials of the COVID-19 vaccine were stopped after neurological complications felt by one of the volunteers under study, the Swedish-British pharmaceutical company published a 111-page report on the trials that promises anti-coronavirus drug with ""50% effectiveness"".This was the first time AstraZeneca has revealed the second case of a serious complication in one of the participants in the third test phase in the UK.The company had already resumed trials in the UK, despite one of the participants having developed a form of transverse myelitis, an inflammation of the spinal cord, while the second volunteer's diagnosis remains to be confirmed.However, the New York Times has quoted a source familiar with the situation that assumes that the second person has suffered the same collateral illness in the past, but that this fact has not yet been reported by AstraZeneca. It turned out that ""the first hiatus, in July, was not publicly revealed and the tests were restarted,"" he says. an article by The Telegraph.Despite pressure to have more in-depth studies conducted following the two complication cases, AstraZeneca has already restarted testing in Britain, Brazil, India and South Africa, although testing is still suspended in the United States due to concerns from National Institutes. of Health (NIH), an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services.This position was shared by experts from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ""We are here to protect the American community and will be doing very important work with the company to find out whether or not there is a serious security problem,"" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a live Instagram interview with the Republican Senator of the United States. United States, Tim Scott, of South Carolina.AstraZeneca has been repeatedly criticized for its lack of transparency from the scientific community. William A. Haseltine, PhD, former professor at Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health, said:""Details of AstraZeneca's suspension of trials have not been fully disclosed and internal discussions have not been made public. It is encouraging to see that they have suspended trials for patient safety, but a lack of transparency on the part of the company. pharmaceutical company is a cause for caution.The paper, in addition to discontinued clinical trials of AstraZeneca's coronavirus drug, exposed the risks associated with over-reliance on new and unverified technology, such as chimpanzee adenovirus.Unlike the human adenovirus vector, which has been extensively studied and effectively used to produce a range of vaccines and other medicines, chimpanzee adenovirus has never been used in any approved vaccine before.The human adenovirus approach is used by numerous pharmaceutical companies to develop vaccines against COVID-19, namely the Chinese CanSino and the American Johnson & Johnson, as well as the Russian Sputnik V vaccine, produced by the Gamaleya Center.Source: https://it.sputniknews.com/mondo/202009219556386-due-casi-di-complicazioni-neurologiche-i-test-del-vaccino-astrazeneca-ancora-fermi-in-usa/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

Tritto explains the origins of the virus with precision and scientific firmness, starting from the Chinese attempt to study vaccines against Sars; inserting genomes from HIV into organisms (which makes them more aggressive); adding elements of coronavirus discovered in ""horseshoe"" bats, with a method called ""reverse genetics system 2"".The first person in charge of these genetic engineering experiments is Professor Shi Zheng Li, head of the Wuhan laboratory. But this center has had the help of the French government and the Pasteur Institute, from which the Chinese have learned the use of HIV genomes. Then there is the help of some American scientists, including prof. Ralph S. Baric, of the University of North Carolina, and funds from US development aid (USAID). US scientists were interested in studies on coronaviruses, which, however, were prohibited in their country until 2017, due to their danger.The professor. Tritto has a very respectable curriculum: he is a doctor specializing in urology, andrology, infertility microsurgery, professor of microtechnology and nanotechnology (UK and India). Visiting Professor and director of nano-medicine at Amity University in New Delhi (India). And for this very reason he can dig into the meaning of these researches done in Wuhan. According to prof. Tritto, such research was born to fight disease, but gradually it turned into bio-engineering studies to build lethal biological weapons.It is no coincidence that in the last 5 years, the Wuhan laboratory has received the most substantial funds in all of China for virological research, becoming a very advanced research laboratory, which the Academy of Sciences, and the Chinese government itself, they have placed under their direct control.According to prof. Tritto, Prof. Shi Zheng-Li “probably had no interest in working for military or other purposes, unless she was forced to do so. Nobody doubts his good faith ”. But it is a fact that after the enormous publicity about the laboratory, caused by the pandemic, today the chief general of the Chinese People's Army, Chen Wei (photo 1), was appointed as the head of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to whom she was flanked by a team where the name of Zhong Nanshang stands out, a famous pulmonologist with long experience in infectious lung diseases. General Chen Wei is also an expert on biochemical weapons and bioterrorism.The Wuhan Institute of Virology was therefore practically a police station and placed under the control of the Armed Forces. Nothing is known about Prof. Shi Zheng-Li: she seems to have disappeared.In the book, scientists don't make a good impression on us: driven by the desire for knowledge, they then become eager for power, careerism, careerism and money. Part of the book is devoted to the issue of vaccine research, where each institute and laboratory competes with each other, not for the sake of medicine and to save the millions of coronavirus sufferers, but just to be the first to sell vaccines to the whole world. In this China is a teacher: according to prof. Tritto, Beijing has not made available the original genetic structure of the coronavirus (mother virus), but has only released partial data. And why? Because only with the original structure of the virus it is possible to produce a truly universal vaccine, effective on every point of the globe. In fact, over time, viruses mutate and a vaccine produced by a mutated virus is only effective in a certain period and in a certain area.In short: instead of love for science, there is only petty trade.The book of prof. Tritto also carries out a review of the World Health Organization, which has become - according to many - ""A puppet"" in the hands of the leadership of Beijing, having indulged its silence on the epidemic.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Virus, Italy ""could have avoided 10.000 deaths"". Guardian shock report","If Italy had updated its anti-pandemic plan, according to the guidelines indicated in recent years by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (Ecdc), Ten thousand of the 35.000 lives lost to Covid-19 could have been saved. This is what the Guardian anticipates, which viewed the report by Pier Paolo Lunelli, who was commander of the School for Nuclear, Bacteriological and Chemical Defense and contributed to writing protocols against pandemics for some countries, including Italy. Italy, we read in the 65 pages of the report, only had an ""old and inadequate plan"" which ""makes no reference to scenarios and planning hypotheses"".According to reports from the British newspaper, Italy did not update its anti-pandemic plan in 2017, when the WHO and the ECDC set out new guidelines. A ""plan for the flu pandemic"" published on the website of the Ministry of Health indicates that the last update dates back to 15 December 2016. However, the properties of the PDF document indicate that the creation of the document itself dates back to January 2006. ""When you change a document, you should also change the title,"" Lunelli told the Guardian. ""It could be that Italy hasn't updated its plan since 2006"".In his report, Lunelli compares the Italian anti-pandemic plan to those of other European countries. ""We are not the only ones with an old plan - he explains - the difference is that we were the first European country hit by the virus, where others have had time to plan"" their response. As a result of Lunelli's report, the 'Noi denouncemò' committee, created by the families of the coronavirus victims, which has already filed over 150 complaints to the judiciary, will also file complaints against all Italian prime minister and health ministers starting from 2013 , for the failure to update the anti-pandemic plan. For Lunelli, who said he was ready to meet the magistrates, the lack of an effective plan had serious consequences on the number of victims and on the economy. ""Dealing with a pandemic without a good plan, with insufficient intensive care capabilities and scarce supplies of protective materials is like driving a bus on a mountain road in the midst of sudden heavy snow, without snow chains,"" writes the general in his report. ""Unfortunately, the Italian bus has gone astray with serious consequences in terms of direct and indirect victims, as well as for the economic impact on some regions that contribute most to the national GDP.""On May 13, the Guardian recalls, WHO published an independent report, which examined what had happened in Italy at the beginning of the pandemic. The goal was to help other countries avoid what had happened in Lombardy. The document was titled, 'An unprecedented challenge: Italy's first response to Covid-19'. The following day, the report was removed from the WHO website at the request, according to the Guardian, of Dr. Ranieri Guerra, WHO assistant director-general for strategic initiatives. The report, prepared by the Emergency Team for Covid-19 at the WHO Venice European Office for Investments in Health and Development, stated that the plan for Italy's pandemic dates back to 2006, after the Sars and he was subsequently ""reconfirmed"". Dr. Guerra, the Guardian recalls, has been director general of health prevention at the Ministry of Health since 2014 and head of the office responsible for updates to the pandemic plan. ""Italy was not entirely unprepared when the first news came from China,"" read the report deleted from the WHO website. ""In 2006, after the first serious Sars epidemic, the Italian Ministry of Health and the regions approved a national response plan for the influenza pandemic, reconfirmed in 2017, with guidelines for regional plans"", the document still read. .

" Usa-Pfizer / Biontech agreement, two billion per cent million doses of anti-Covid vaccine","The first supply includes at least 100 million doses with the possibility, if the trials are successful, of reaching 500 millionFrom what is learned from the AboutPharma website, after the agreement of the United Kingdom, the USA-Pfizer / Biontech agreement also arrives a few days later. Cost of the operation about two billion dollars per 100 million doses. The White House, following the example of London, takes another contract home by signing it with the German and American companies.The first supply of the German Biontech will arrive in 2021 with 300 million doses, but already a first supply will cover the needs for 100 million. However, the doses provided are highly likely to reach 500 million. Pfizer makes it known that to speed up the time, both the clinical step and the development of mass production (with all the risks involved in terms of safety, efficacy) were initiated, on which the regulatory agencies have obviously not yet expressed their opinion.The agreement between the parties and the acceleration by Pfizer are the result of the immediate need to have results that can be spent immediately or in any case within a few months also given that the competition is ruthless especially after the news of the good results of the research put in place from Astrazeneca / Oxford / Irbm. Still in the forecasts and expectations by the end of the year, the two companies would like to produce at least 100 million total doses globally and then reach 1,3 billion by the end of next year.Article by Aboutpharma Online editorial staff of 22 July 2020Source: https://www.aboutpharma.com/blog/2020/07/22/accordo-usa-pfizer-biontech-due-miliardi-per-cento-milioni-di-dosi-di-vaccino-anti-covid/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

 Covid-19 vaccine: 81% of the clinical trial volunteers had reactions to the vaccine,"Vaccine that uses HEK293 human fetal cell linesPain, fever, fatigue, headache among the most common reactions to the CanSino Ad5-nCoV vaccine for COVID-19. Experimental trials of COVID-1273's Modern mRNA-19 COVID-19 also recorded grade 3 reactions. CanSino reported entering Phase 2 of the human clinical trial on the Ad5-nCoV vaccine for COVID-19.The CanSino Ad5-n-CoV vaccine uses human fetal cell lines HEK-293 for production. According to News Medical:The HEK293 cell is described by Creative Biolabs in this way:Referencesby Marco Cáceres and Barbara Loe FisherPosted on 6 July 2020 | Vaccination, Risk & Failure ReportsAn experimental vaccine for COVID-19 has been developed by CanSino Biologics, Inc. of Tianjin, China, in collaboration with the Institute of China's Academy of Military Medical Sciences' Institute of Biotechnology. A Phase 1 human clinical trial of the COVID-19 vaccine (adenovirus type-5 Ad5-nCoV) has been completed in China with 108 volunteers, aged between 45 and 60. (1 2 3 4)In that trial, 87 (81 percent) of the 108 participants experienced at least one adverse reaction within seven days of vaccination. Of these, 30 participants were in the low-dose group, 30 were in the medium-dose group, and 27 were in the high-dose group. Overall, 10 of the participants had grade 3 adverse reactions. Of the 36 participants in the high-dose group, six of them had grade 3 adverse reactions. (1 2)According to the researchers who conducted the Phase 1 clinical trial study for the Ad5-nCoV vaccine: the most common injection site adverse reaction was pain, which was reported in 58 (54%) vaccine recipients. Pain was reported in 17 (47%) participants in the low dose group, 20 (56%) participants in the medium dose group, and 21 (58%) participants in the high dose group. The most commonly reported systemic adverse reactions were overall fever (50 [46%]), fatigue (47 [44%]), headache (42 [39%]) and muscle pain (18 [17%]). Fever was reported in 15 (42%) participants in the low dose group, 15 (42%) participants in the medium dose group, and 20 (56%) participants in the high dose group. Headache was reported in 14 (39%) participants in the low dose group, 11 (31%) participants in the medium dose group, and 17 (47%) participants in the high dose group. Muscle pain was reported in 7 (19%) participants in the low dose group, 3 (8%) participants in the medium dose group and eight (22%) participants in the high dose group. (2)Nine of the participants, including two in the low-dose group, two in the medium-dose group and five in the high-dose group, developed grade 3 fevers of over 101,3 ° F (38.5 ° C). One of the participants in the high-dose group reported ""severe fever along with severe symptoms of fatigue, wheezing and muscle pain"". Another participant in the high-dose group experienced ""severe fatigue and joint pain"". The reactions occurred within 24 hours of vaccination. (1 2) As in the CanSino Phase 5 Ad1-nCov vaccine trial, some participants in the Phase 1 mRNA-1273 COVID-19 vaccine trial conducted by Moderna, Inc. also experienced Grade 3 reactions earlier this year. Of the 45 volunteers who participated in the Moderna clinical trial during the March-May 2020 period, nine percent of them had serious adverse reactions to the mRNA-1273 vaccine, including 29-year-old Ian Haydon from Seattle, Washington. (1 2) Haydon underwent Grade 3 reactions twelve hours after obtaining the second of two 250 µg doses of the mRNA-1273 vaccine. He developed a fever of over 103 degrees (39.5 C °) and eventually passed out. (1 2) Grade 3 reactions are described by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as ""serious or medically significant but not immediately life-threatening; hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization; disabling; which limits being able to take care of oneself ""like"" bathing, getting dressed and undressing, feeding, using the toilet, taking drugs "". The only thing worse than Grade 3 events are those classified as Grade 4, which is ""life threatening"" and ""Grade 5, which is"" death "". (5 6 7) Reportedly, CanSino Biologics has started a Phase 2 human clinical trial of the Ad5-nCoV vaccine using the HEK293 cell line which provides testing on 500 healthy volunteers. On May 12, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) announced a collaboration agreement with the Chinese company to ""advance biotreatment and clinical development in Canada"" for the Ad5-nCoV vaccine. (4 8 9 10) In a press release, the NRC said: ""This partnership will allow the NRC to advance a scale-up (high-level) production process for the candidate vaccine, using its proprietary cell line. HEK293 ""(9 10) To facilitate this work, the Canadian government has announced that it will provide $ 44 million to upgrade Montreal's NRC facilities to"" enable compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards ""and to"" ensure the availability of potential vaccine candidates for Canadian biotreatment as soon as they become available ""(9). ""It's the perfect time to take advantage of the cutting-edge technology and resources of both sides that are critical to Ad5-nCoV's development,"" said Xuefeng Yu, CEO of CanSino Biologics. (10)Life Site News reported on June 26, 2020 that CanSino's Ad5-n-CoV vaccine uses a chimpanzee adenovirus vector that uses HEK293 cell lines derived from the tissue of an aborted fetus. (11) The human fetal cell line HEK293, which It was designed, developed and authorized by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), it is also used to produce the AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Jenner Institute of the University of Oxford. The joint May 12, 2020 press release issued by the Canadian NRC and CanSino Biologics, Inc. said: ""The relationship between the NRC and CanSinoBIO was first established in 2013. The NRC's HEK293 cell line was subsequently licensed to CanSinoBIO and used for the development of an approved vaccine against the Ebola virus ""(12).The HEK293 cell line was initially produced in 1973 by a team led by Alex van der Eb in Leiden (the Netherlands) from normal fetal embryonic human kidney cells. These cells were created following a transfection with the cut DNA 5 adenovirus, which led to the incorporation of part of the adenoviral genome into human chromosome 19 of the fetal cell genome. The name 293 derives from the fact that it was the 293rd experiment of Frank Graham (one of van de Eb's postdoctorates). These cells were initially thought to originate from an endothelial, epithelial, or fibroblastic cell from the fetal kidney. However, recent evidence in the cellular characteristics of HEK293 cells has led to the suggestion that they may actually come from a fetal kidney neuronal cell. Following sequencing studies, it has also been identified that these cells have a very complicated karyotype, with multiple copies of chromosomes. For example, these cells have four copies of chromosome 17. It has also been established that these cells do not have a single Y chromosome, but have three X chromosomes, which suggests that the fetus from which they were obtained is a female. (13)The Human Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK293) cell line is a predominant host for both stable and transient expression of proteins of varying degrees of research and therapeutic proteins, and more recently, five therapeutic agents produced in HEK293 cells are have been approved by the FDA or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for therapeutic use. Since it was generated more than 40 years ago, the HEK293 cell line has been used extensively as a robust and reliable platform to produce a lot of recombinant antibodies, antibody fusion proteins and proteins important for the neuropharmacologist, such as paired receptors of the G protein, ligand-gated ion channels and voltage sensitive (voltage) ion channels. The HEK293 cell line was originally generated by the transformation of normal human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells after exposure to cut fragments of human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) of DNA. The adenovirus E1A gene is expressed in these cells and participates in the transactivation of some viral promoters, allowing these cells to produce very high levels of proteins.

" Coronavirus, Guardian: ""WHO and governments have based policies on 'fake' data""","The World Health Organization and various national governments have modified their Covid-19 response policies and therapies based on ""imperfect"" data from a half-known US health analytics company. The Guardian writes it in an exclusive investigation that shines the spotlight on Surgisphere, a US company whose staff also includes ""a science fiction writer and a model for adult magazines"", which provided the data necessary for the compilation of various studies on Covid -19 also published in the 'Lancet' and the 'New England journal of medicine', but which ""until now has not provided explanations on the data or on the methodology"" applied.The data that Surgisphere claims to have legitimately acquired from over a thousand hospitals around the world, writes the Guardian, have been the basis of scientific articles that have led to a modification of treatments for Covid-19 in Latin American countries. The same data has been used by WHO and research institutes around the world to stop testing the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has long been debated for the treatment of coronavirus.Two of the world's leading scientific journals such as 'Lancet' and the 'New England journal of medicine', the Guardian points out, have published studies based on data from the Surgisphere. Co-author of these studies is the CEO of the US company, Sapan Desai. After being contacted by the Guardian reporters, who informed them about the results of the investigation, the two magazines expressed ""concern"". The other authors of the published studies, not affiliated with Desai's Surgisphere, have now commissioned an independent investigation following the doubts raised about the ""reliability of the database"" used.The Guardian points out that, as a result of research into publicly available material, many Surgisphere employees have little or no scientific experience. One of the employees, referred to as the chief science editor, is actually a science fiction writer, while the 'marketing executive' turns out to be an adult magazine model and hostess for trade shows and congresses.source:https://www.adnkronos.com/fatti/esteri/2020/06/03/coronavirus-guardian-oms-governi-hanno-basato-politiche-dati-taroccati_UJqz4LICXCILoA7s1Xr5kO.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 WHO changes the guidelines: no negative buffer is needed to be considered cured by Covid,"The WHO has changed the rules: only three days without symptoms and goodbye isolation. Regardless of the severity of the infectionGoodbye to the double negative bufferThe problems that creates a long isolation periodAfter three days without symptoms, you can say goodbye to isolation. The World Health Organization has in fact changed the cards on the tables and has communicated that it will no longer be necessary to have the double negative buffer to certify the healing, and therefore to leave the home. They will indeed be sufficient 3 days without symptoms to return free. Regardless of the severity of the infection.As reported by Courier, the new criteria imposed byWHO they are essentially two. Symptomatic patients will have to wait 10 days after the onset of symptoms, and at least 3 days without symptoms, this also applies to fever and respiratory symptoms. For patients asymptomatic instead, we talk about 10 days after the positive swab result. This means that if a person has had symptoms for two days, after 10 + 3 days, or 13 from the beginning of the symptoms, they will be able to get out of isolation. If, on the other hand, a patient has had symptoms for 14 days, he will be able to say he is free at the end of the 17th (14 + 3). If the symptoms lasted 30 days, he will be considered out of isolation on day 33 (30 + 3).This change is due to the fact that the active virus, that is, what can replicate and infect other subjects, would not be present, except in very rare cases, in the patient's respiratory samples 9 days after the onset of coronavirus symptoms. This occurs especially in cases of mild infection, together with the formation of neutralizing antibodies. The patient is then freed from isolation based on clinical criteria, and no longer on repeat swab examination. This may indeed continue to find non-viable traces of RNA for several weeks, although not dangerous.Not to mention that being in solitary confinement for a long time can have a negative impact both on the person himself and on society, and on access to medical treatment. The new rules of the World Health Organization therefore serve to reduce the period of isolation for many patients who are not risky for themselves or for other individuals. This would also increase the resources for new asymptomatic swabs. Not to mention the savings: many of these swabs are performed precisely to certify healing from the coronavirus.The epidemiologist Luigi Lopalco explained that this issue is very important, as it is “There are many people who are prisoners in the house for weeks who show no symptoms and also happen cases di positive swabs after two negative swabs. We are sending these tests to specialized laboratories to understand if it is a non-viable RNA residue or if the virus grows in culture and therefore could still be contagious. The American CDCs have implemented the new WHO guidelines, let's see what Italy will decide "". Source: https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/coronavirus-stop-doppio-tampone-negativo-certificare-1871838.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Chinese shadows on Covid, who doesn't want the emergency to end","Covid is running out, but there are those who continue to fuel fear to maintain social limitations. And so the China alarm for contagion cases in Beijing was recreated: 130 people in all in a city of 21 million inhabitants, anything but an emergency. And even in Italy scientific evidence speaks of an increasingly aggressive and virulent virus, the Mario Negri Institute has also documented that new positives are no longer contagious. But the obstinacy with which unreasonable fears are fueled cannot fail to arouse suspicions about political and economic interests behind this epidemic that must not end.Covid is running out, but there are those who just don't want to resign themselves to this evidence, and persistently continue to argue that the threat is always looming, that limitations to social life must continue to be maintained.Since the data doesn't match this narrative, here we resort to China, a bogeyman who can always come in handy. And so in recent days the regime media have told us of an ""extremely serious"" situation, of a Beijing engaged ""in a fight against time"" to stop the contagion, through ""the strictest, most decisive and determined measures"", according to the classic Chinese model which was then imported into Italy.So we went to see the numbers of this new emergency, and tell us about 130 cases of infection in a week in the capital. Beijing - it should be remembered - is a city of over 21 million inhabitants. So we have one case of infected people per 200.000 inhabitants. It is as if we had five cases in Milan. And we are talking about the infected, not the hospitalized or least of the dead.So what emergency are we talking about?However, the Italian government continues to insist on the existence of new cases of Covid diagnosed. According to the Ministry of Health, this must call for caution as it would denote ""that in some parts of the country the circulation of the virus is still significant"", reads the weekly report for the period from 8 to 14 June of the Phase 2 Monitoring. "" throughout the Peninsula - continues the document - new cases of infection have been diagnosed in the current monitoring week, with cases increasing compared to the previous monitoring week "".However, the number of inpatients - particularly in intensive care facilities - continues to decline, as does mortality. What does this evidence mean, which the government does everything to hide? That the virus is losing its aggression and virulence.While trying to rekindle fear, The evaluation of an authoritative scientist, Professor Remuzzi, director of the Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research, one of the most prestigious institutions in Europe, arrived last Friday as a cold shower. ""The new positives are not contagious,"" he said in an interview. And this is because the viral load has become very low. This was discovered by analyzing the swabs made in the course of research promoted by the Institute itself, which has shown that current cases of positivity have a very low, non-contagious viral load. We call them contagions, but they are simply buffer positive people. These are positivity that have no clinical consequences: they are not sick people, and they cannot transmit the disease to anyone.Someone might object that it is a single study, but in reality other authoritative works are coming out confirming this picture, such as that of Center for Disease Prevention of South Korea made on 285 positive asymptomatic people, which traced 790 of their direct contacts. How many new positives? Zero.                         According to the director of Mario Negri, The Istituto Superiore di Sanità and the government must qualify the new positivity, or allow the laboratories to do so, explaining to the people that a positivity of less than one hundred thousand copies is not contagious, therefore it does not make sense to stay at home, to isolate, as it is not more useful to make traces that were good at the beginning of the epidemic.The existence of new positives must not create any alarmism: it is not the same type of positivity as in the past months. A positivity that can no longer give the serious clinical forms that we saw in the first three months of the epidemic. The government therefore needs to take note of how much and how the situation has changed since that distant 20 February. And act and communicate accordingly.Continuing to feed unreasonable fears can only arouse reasonable suspicions that political and economic interests are being played out on this epidemic that should not ""pass"". It is no coincidence that government circles only repeat - deaf to any scientific evidence - that two things are essential to put an end to the Covid affair: tracking apps and vaccines. Tertium non datur, although the scientific evidence says much more.Source: https://lanuovabq.it/it/ombre-cinesi-sul-covid-chi-non-vuole-che-lemergenza-finisca",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Coronavirus, the Region has miscalculated: ""The positives are less than a fifth of those declared""","Crossing the civil protection data with those of the ISS it emerged that the infected are in all 153 and not 805 as said in the latest bulletin on Wednesday: ""We are almost Covid free""Sorry, we were wrong.

 Herd immunity: the paper castle begins to collapse,"Still susceptibleAntibody levelsPrevent diseaseLet's take a cue from a recent article published on Bloomberg - which reports declarations of various characters related to vaccines developing against Covid-19 - to make some considerations on the propaganda that has always been used on vaccines and some sensational contradictions. In particular, I would like to dwell on a concept that is both abused and misleading: the ""protection of the flock"" or immunity of flock, a concept that anyone who has been interested in the vaccination issue will certainly have had the opportunity to study at least a minimum.In recent years, everything has been read and heard about vaccines; the various ""experts"" or self-styled ones chased each other to the sound of the goodness, safety and efficacy of each vaccine on the market, and at the same time they tried to criminalize those who dared to question the official narrative on the matter. Well, by dint of ""shooting"" you end up contradicting yourself: one example is the set of statements contained in this article - which we invite you to read in full below, but of which I would now like to underline some passages that demonstrate how easy it is lying to the population when trying to convince that vaccinating everyone is essential to protect the ""community"". For example Dennis Burton, immunologist and vaccine researcher, states here that ""Vaccines need to protect against disease, not necessarily infection.""  But how, until now we have focused on the hunt for asymptomatic greaser, and now they come to tell us that the vaccine would not prevent this condition?!?Indeed, we read that it could even increase it: ""Covid-19 is believed to be spread by people without symptoms and a vaccine that prevents symptoms can create even more."" You read that right, but it is certainly not new and those who had investigated the question for other vaccines already know this concept very well: vaccinated does not mean immunized but above all it is not synonymous with ""non-contagious""!  And in fact later we read: “About 3% of people who receive the measles vaccine develop a mild form of the disease and can spread it to others "". I got it? In the run-up to statements that attempt to clear the goodness of a forthcoming anti-Covid vaccine, what the media have so far branded as fake-news becomes admissible: the vaccinated themselves become the ""greasers"" of the disease from which they would like to protect themselves! !! Other than herd immunity!  Note well that it is on the assumption of the ""non-vaccinated child = danger-for-society"" that the whole schedule of vaccination obligations in Italy has been based in the last 3 years! And today we are told candidly that, in essence, we have always been right: vaccination is not at all synonymous with collective protection from a disease, but often even facilitates the condition of asymptomatic (or pauci-symptomatic) carrier.  This is not only true for measles, but, as we have always argued, also for many other vaccines, for example that of whooping cough, which in fact is also mentioned below by an FDA spokesman, such Felberbaum: “The authorized vaccines , including some against whooping cough, have not been shown to protect against disease-causing pathogen infections, but have been shown to protect against symptomatic diseases (from the symptoms, editor's note), ""he said. But there is more to think about.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering options for a vaccine that prevents diseases (not infections):""We could potentially consider an indication related to the prevention of serious diseases, provided that the available data support the benefits of vaccination,"" said FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum in response to the questions. ""For licensing, we wouldn't require a vaccine to protect against infections.""  Vaccines as a therapy against a certain disease complication, therefore. Nothing bad if not that this undermines the leitmotif of the fight against ""anti-vaccination"": those who do not get vaccinated, according to these statements, are not at all a problem for others, nor for the community, nor for the ""immunosuppressed"": in other words, if you believe in it, get vaccinated, but at this point any prerequisite to impose an obligation on the population in any age group is lost. There are therefore no reasons used so far to endorse a health tax, an imposition which in itself constitutes an aberration of the civil and constitutional rights of the individual and which all the more appears to us to be criminal, if seen from these assumptions.Here is the translation of the entire article:Desperate to find a way to stop economies from collapsing under the weight of Covid-19 could mean settling for a vaccine that prevents people from getting sick or dying, but doesn't stop them from getting coronavirus.Although the ultimate vaccine against the virus is the ultimate goal, early vaccines may have limitations on what they can provide, according to Robin Shattock, a professor from Imperial College London who leads the development of an experimental shot.""Is it protection against infections?"" Shattock says. “Is it protection against disease? Is it a protection against serious diseases? It is entirely possible that a vaccine that only protects against serious diseases is very useful. ""As countries cautiously emerge from lockdowns, leaders are looking at a preventive vaccine as a way to return to pre-pandemic life. Fueled by billions of dollars in government investment, vaccines from little-known companies like CanSino Biologics Inc. and giants such as Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc are being developed.At least one of the fastest experimental has already advanced in human studies after showing an impact on serious diseases - but less on infection - in animals. Experts argue that such a product would likely be widely used if approved, even until a more effective version is launched.""Vaccines need to protect against disease, not necessarily infection,"" said Dennis Burton, immunologist and vaccine researcher at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.There are drawbacks, however. Despite having the potential to save lives, these vaccines could bring complacency to the tired nations of the blockade, said Michael Kinch, a drug development expert who is an associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis.""My guess is that the day after someone got vaccinated, they would think"" I can go back to normal. Everything will be fine"". They won't necessarily realize that they may still be susceptible to infection. ""Covid-19 is believed to be spread by people without symptoms and a vaccine that prevents symptoms can create even more.Vaccines are among the most effective weapons against infectious diseases and prevent up to 3 million deaths per year, according to the World Health Organization. Yet few, if any, are 100% effective in all the people who get them. For example, about 3% of people who receive the measles vaccine develop a mild form of the disease and can spread it to others.In their attempts to deal with a rapidly growing threat, developers are turning to technologies that have never been successfully used in humans. More than 130 vaccines are in preparation for Covid-19 prevention, according to the World Health Organization.Vaccines work by presenting a form of germ - or a key part of it - to the immune system by preparing the body to respond when real exposure occurs. When this happens, immune proteins called antibodies attack the virus, blocking its entry into cells. Sometimes vaccines increase immune T cells, which don't do much to prevent infections, but can slow down and eventually stop their progression.A common approach to increasing antibody levels is by injecting a virus that has been inactivated or killed. About nine of these are being tested: one, produced by the Chinese Sinovac Biotech Ltd., has led to high levels of target antibodies to Covid in monkeys.Another vaccine developed at the University of Oxford uses an innovative approach in which Covid genes are inserted into a different and harmless virus. They produce proteins that are recognized by the immune system, which increases the defenses against a real infection.About a quarter of the experimental vaccines listed by WHO, including two already in the human study, follow the same approach as the Oxford vaccine. One of the advantages of technology is its speed. AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford, said it will start delivering doses to the United Kingdom as early as September and will have doses to the United States, which helped fund development, the following month.On Saturday, AstraZeneca and four European Union countries (including Italy, ed.) Said they had reached an agreement to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine. Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech also said over the weekend that the results of its vaccine test in humans support advancement to the final phase studies.It is not yet clear how the vaccine developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca affects infections. William Haseltine, a former HIV researcher at Harvard University, pointed out in a Forbes blog that animals had roughly the same amount of viral genetic material, called RNA, regardless of whether or not they received vaccines . The levels of antibodies to the virus were not as high as seen in highly protective vaccines, he said.However, clinical signs of severe infection, such as high respiratory rate and pneumonia, were better in vaccinated monkeys. This could still make such a recovery useful, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases.""That vaccine doesn't appear to be an infection protection knockout, but it could be very good at protecting against disease,"" Fauci told the Stat Medical News website.The vaccine will be a hit for both infections and serious symptoms, said Pascal Soriot, CEO of AstraZeneca, in an interview with the BBC. Advances in the vaccine in advanced studies have been approved by an independent scientific team and the company is waiting to see how it performs, a spokesman said.Faucius NIAID has partnered with Moderna Inc. for a Covid vaccine test whose main goal is to show that their vaccine prevents people from developing symptoms, the company said on June 11. Preventing infections is a secondary goal.Successful preventions must also prevent subsequent transmission, said Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard University. Effective vaccines may allow some cells to become infected, but they control the growth of the virus before it can be passed on to others, said Barouch, who is developing a vaccine with Johnson & Johnson. He said his efforts are aimed at a vaccine that prevents infections.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering options for a disease-preventing vaccine.""We could potentially consider an indication related to the prevention of serious diseases, provided that the available data support the benefits of vaccination,"" said FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum in response to the questions. ""For licensing, we wouldn't require a vaccine to protect against infections.""Authorized vaccines, including some against whooping cough, have not been shown to protect against infections with the disease-causing pathogen, but have been shown to protect against symptomatic diseases, Felberbaum said.The idea of ​​using imperfect vaccines and therapies is ""good,"" said Kinch. ""This is just practicality. And we can follow with other better ones. There will never be a really perfect vaccine.""Source:  https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/the-first-covid-vaccines-may-not-prevent-you-from-getting-covid",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Virus, Guardian accuses: ""WHO and governments have acted on the tarot data of an unknown company""","Covid-19, il Guardian in un'inchiesta esclusiva punta i riflettori sulla Surgisphere, azienda Usa nel cui staff figurano anche «uno scrittore di fantascienza e una modella di riviste per adulti», che ha fornito i dati necessari alla compilazione di diversi studi sul Covid-19 pubblicati anche su 'Lancet' e sul 'New England journal of medicinè, ma che «fino ad ora non ha fornito spiegazioni sui dati o sulla metodologia» applicata. L'Organizzazione mondiale della sanità e vari governi nazionali hanno modificato le loro politiche di risposta al Covid-19 e le terapie, quindi, sulla base di dati «imperfetti» provenienti da una semisconosciuta azienda statunitense che si occupa di analisi sanitaria. The data that Surgisphere claims to have acquired legitimately from over a thousand hospitals around the world, the Guardian writes, they have been the basis of scientific articles that have led to a modification of therapies for Covid-19 in Latin American countries. The same data have been used by WHO and research institutes around the world to stop tests on the use of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has long been debated for the treatment of coronavirus. Two of the world's leading scientific journals such as Lancet and  New England journal of medicine, the Guardian points out, have published studies based on Surgispehere data. Co-author of these studies is the CEO of the US company, Sapan Desai. After being contacted by Guardian journalists, who informed them of the results of the investigation, the two magazines expressed ""concern"". The other authors of the published studies, not affiliated with Desai's Surgisphere, have now commissioned an independent investigation following the doubts raised about the ""reliability of the database"" used.The Guardian points out that, following research on publicly available material, many Surgispehere employees have little or no scientific experience. One of the employees, indicated as chief scientific editor, is actually a science fiction writer, while the 'marketing manager' actually turned out to be a model of adult magazines and hostesses for fairs and conferences. The company's Linkedn page has fewer than 100 followers and last week, the Guardian reports, it indicated a staff of six, which then became three in the last three hours. Surgisphere, which claims to manage ""one of the largest and fastest hospital databases in the world,"" notes the Guardian, has virtually no online presence. The Twitter account has fewer than 170 followers, with no posts between October 2017 and March 2020.Source: https://www.ilmessaggero.it/salute/focus/virus_inchiesta_fake_news_dati_manipolati_surgisphere_azienda_taroccata_dati_cosa_e_successo_davvero-5266410.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Covid: Lancet's disturbing misstep on chloroquine,"After the withdrawal of the study that rejects the antimalarial drug, Dr. Andrea Mangiagalli, promoter of the Medici group in the front line, denounces the maneuvers that try to hinder their use on Covid-19 patients. A very low cost treatment which, if used at an early stage as the general practitioner of Pioltello did together with hundreds of colleagues, risks jamming the machine that tries to make money on the pandemic. The publication in The Lancet of the study signed by a Harvard professor, Mandeep Mehra, had prompted the World Health Organization to stop testing on hydroxychloroquine. The WHO decision in turn led the drug agencies of Italy and France to suspend the authorization to use the antimalarial drug.Here is the interview published in the weekly Panorama:Dr. Mangiagalli, why were you perplexed about this study? ""Because none of the doctors in Italy who have used chloroquine in the area have verified the presence of serious side effects at the cardiac level, let alone an increase in mortality. And we are talking about thousands of cases: besides us in Milan, to use chloroquine on the territory there is the oncologist of the Piacenza hospital Luigi Cavanna, who brought the chloroquine to the patients' home, colleagues from the Alessandria model and many others doctors who have used this scheme individually. Not to mention all the hospitals that have used it extensively, in an almost total way, starting from Sant'Orsola in Bologna, where Professor Pierluigi Viale suggested giving ""tape chloroquine"" ».But she had a doubt put forward, saying that chloroquine costs too little and does not generate any kind of profits. ""It is true, so much so that Sanofi itself, the French multinational that produces it, did not move aggressively to promote its drug.""Perhaps it was more profitable for Big Pharma to focus on the vaccine or on new drugs to be sold at a high price? ""In fact, if the pandemic resolved with a very low-cost drug used on a large scale at an early stage, the entire health and pharmaceutical organization that revolves around Covid would risk jamming. And the potential multi-billion dollar profits (which many yearn for and that the stock market rewards) would go up in smoke ».But how is it possible that The Lancet-yesa fell into a trap, however so coarse? «I find it hard to believe that a magazine with almost two centuries of history, so far considered the researchers' Bible, could have fallen into a trap. At this level it never happened. Let's not forget, then, that the study was signed by a Harvard professor. Yet it is true that he used a very questionable data collection methodology based exclusively on artificial intelligence ».And if it wasn't a trap, what was it? «I don't know ... To be honest, as incredible as it may seem, I too fear that someone's hand may be behind this operation. I don't know if interested in promoting the collection of big data through artificial intelligence or if interested in ousting such a ""dangerous"" drug from the game for those who would like to make money on the pandemic like chloroquine ».What is certain is that, thanks to this study, chloroquine has been banned in many other countries, starting from Italy. ""I do not know what to say. What is certain is that we doctors who have used it have also been pressured to reconsider our therapeutic choice. Not to mention the ostracism also from the media ».Could President Donald Trump's support have played a role? ""Probably yes. A political war has started against poor hydroxychloroquine against Trump's reelection. Because that's what's going on. ""A war that is also mediatic. «Above all media. As a conclusion, tell us that too many things don't add up. We are talking about a drug that we have been using for 30 years without any problem, which is cheap, which is available on all five continents, which has never killed anyone. Yet it ended up in the eye of a hurricane of a political war too.Do you doctors in the front line want to start prescribing chloroquine again? ""Yup. We wrote to The Lancet to President Sergio Mattarella to tell about our experience. And then we sent a request to the Medicines Agency and the Ministry of Health to revoke the suspension of the use of hydroxychloroquine. Because we want to be able to go back to cure our Covid patients, as we did before this study stopped us.

 China has delayed the release of information on the coronavirus,"Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a rapid response to the new coronavirus. He repeatedly thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus ""immediately"" and said that his work and commitment to transparency was ""very impressive and beyond words"".But behind the scenes, he discovered the Associated Press. it was a very different story: significant delays on the part of China and considerable frustration among WHO officials for not getting the information they needed to combat the spread of the deadly virus.Despite public compliments, China actually ""sat down"" on the release of the genetic map - or genome - of the virus for more than a week, after three different government labs completely decoded the information. According to dozens of interviews and internal documents, the fault lay with strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system.Chinese government laboratories released the genome only after another laboratory published it, before authorities, on a virologist website on January 11. Even then, China stopped for at least another two weeks in providing WHO with detailed patient and case data, according to internal meeting records organized by the United Nations agency for health until January - all in a moment. where the epidemic could have slowed dramatically.WHO director-general Tedros Ghebreyesus speaks during a news conference in Geneva in March. (Salvatore Di Nolfi / Keystone via AP)WHO officials praised China in public because they wanted to get more information from the government, so the records obtained by the AP suggest. In private, they complained during the meetings of the week of January 6 that China did not share enough data to evaluate the effectiveness of the virus among people or the risk it posed for the rest of the world, costing precious time.""We are going on very minimal information,"" said American epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, now WHO technical director for COVID-19, in an internal meeting. ""Clearly it is not enough for you to make adequate planning.""""We are currently at the stage where yes, they are giving it to us, 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,"" said WHO chief official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the Chinese central state television, in another meeting.The story behind the first response to the virus comes at a time when the United Nations health agency is under harassment and accepted one independent investigation how the pandemic was managed globally. After repeatedly praising the Chinese response at the outset, U.S. President Donald Trump blew up the WHO in recent weeks for alleged collusion with China likely to hide the magnitude of the coronavirus crisis. Trump has cut ties with the organization on Friday, jeopardizing the approximately $ 450 million that the United States gives annually as the largest single donor to the WHO.Meanwhile, Chinese President Xi Jinping has promised to pay $ 2 billion over the next two years to fight coronavirus, claiming that China has always provided information to the WHO and the world ""in a timely manner"".The new information does not support the narrative of the United States or China, but instead portrays an agency now stuck in the middle, which was urgently trying to request more data despite limited authority. Although international law requires countries to report information that may have an impact on public health to the WHO, the United Nations agency does not have control powers and cannot independently investigate outbreaks within countries. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of the Member States.Dr. Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization representative in China, during an interview at the WHO offices in Beijing. (AP Photo / Mark Schiefelbein)Records suggest that instead of colluding with China as Trump declared, WHO was itself kept in the dark, while China provided the minimum information required by law. However, the agency tried to portray China in the best light, probably as a means of getting more information. And WHO experts really thought that Chinese scientists had done ""a great job"" in detecting and decoding the virus, despite the lack of transparency by Chinese officials.WHO staff discussed how to put pressure on China for gene sequences and detailed patient data without angering the authorities, worried about losing access and putting Chinese scientists in trouble. Under international law, WHO is required to quickly share information and warnings with member countries about an evolving crisis. Galea noted that the WHO could not indulge China's desire to approve the information before saying it to other countries because ""this is not respectful of our responsibilities"".In the second week of January, WHO's chief of emergencies, Dr. Michael Ryan, told colleagues that it was time to ""shift gears"" and put more pressure on China, fearing a repeat of what happened in 2002 with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome which has killed nearly 800 people worldwide.Michael Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's Health Emergencies program, at a news conference in Geneva. (Salvatore Di Nolfi / Keystone via AP)""This is exactly the same scenario, we were constantly trying to get updates from China on what was going on,"" he said. ""WHO has barely come out with its neck intact, given the problems of transparency in southern China.""Ryan said the best way to ""protect China"" from possible actions by other countries is for the WHO to do its own independent analysis with Chinese government data that the virus can easily spread among people. Ryan also noted that China did not cooperate in the same way as other countries in the past.""This wouldn't have happened in the Congo and it wouldn't have happened in the Congo and other places,"" he said, probably referring to the Ebola epidemic that started there in 2018. ""We have to see the data ... It's absolutely important at this point.""The delay in the release of the genome has blocked the recognition of its spread in other countries, together with the global development of tests, drugs and vaccines. The lack of detailed patient data also made it more difficult to determine how quickly the virus was spreading, a crucial issue in stopping it.Between the day the full genome was first decoded by a government laboratory, January 2, and the day the WHO declared a global emergency on January 30, the outbreak spread with a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to i retrospective data of the infection provided by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus has now infected over 6 million people worldwide and killed over 375.000.""It goes without saying that we could have saved more lives and avoided many, many deaths if China and WHO had acted faster,"" said Ali Mokdad, a professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Assessment of the University of Washington.However, Mokdad and other experts also noted that if the WHO had been more confrontational with China, it could have triggered a much worse situation and obtained no information.If the WHO had pushed too hard, it could even have been kicked out of China, said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney. But he added that a delay of a few days in the release of genetic sequences can be critical in an outbreak. And he noted that as Beijing's lack of transparency becomes clearer, the continued defense of China by WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is problematic.""It has certainly damaged WHO's credibility,"" said Kamradt-Scott. “Has it gone too far? I think the evidence is clear ... it has led to so many questions about the relationship between China and WHO. It is perhaps a warning. ""WHO and its officials cited in this story have refused to answer questions posed by the Associated Press without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to provide to protect its sources.""Our leadership and staff worked day and night in compliance with the Organization's rules and regulations to support and share information with all Member States in the same way and engage in frank conversations with governments at all levels"", affirmed a WHO statement.The Chinese National Health Commission and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not commented. But in recent months, China has repeatedly defended its actions and many other countries, including the United States, they responded to the virus with even longer delays  di settimane e even months.""Since the outbreak began, we have continued to share information about the epidemic with the WHO and the international community in an open, transparent and accountable way,"" said Liu Mingzhu, an official from the International Department of the National Health Commission, in a press conference May 15th.The race to find the genetic map of the virus began in late December, according to the story that takes place in WHO interviews, documents and records. It was then that Wuhan's doctors noticed mysterious groups of patients with fever and respiratory problems who were not getting better with the standard flu treatment. In search of answers, they sent test samples from patients to commercial labs.By December 27, a laboratory, Vision Medicals, had assembled most of the genome of a new coronavirus with striking similarities to SARS. Vision Medicals shared its data with officials from Wuhan and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, as first reported by Chinese financial publication Caixin and independently confirmed by the AP.On December 30, Wuhan health officials released internal warnings about the unusual pneumonia that leaked on social media. That evening, Shi Zhengli, a coronavirus expert from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, famous for tracing the SARS virus in a bat cave, was warned of the new disease, according to an interview with Scientific American. Shi took the first train from a conference in Shanghai to return to Wuhan.Shi Zhengli works with other researchers in a lab at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. (Chinatopix via AP)The next day, the Chinese director of CDC Gao Fu sent a team of experts to Wuhan. Also on December 31, WHO first learned of the cases from an open source platform that searches for information on outbreaks, emergency chief Ryan said.WHO officially requested more information on January 1st. Under international law, members have 24 to 48 hours to respond, and China reported two days later that there had been 44 cases and no deaths.By January 2, Shi had decoded the entire genome of the virus, according to a warning later published in the your institution's website.Scientists agree that Chinese scientists detected and sequenced the then unknown pathogen with surprising speed, testifying to China's significantly improved technical capabilities after SARS, during which a WHO-led team of scientists employed months to identify the virus. This time, Chinese virologists showed in a few days that it was a coronavirus never seen before. Tedros would later say that Beijing has defined ""a new standard for responding to epidemics.""But when it came to sharing information with the world, things started to get worse.On January 3, the National Health Commission issued a confidential notice ordering laboratories with the virus to destroy their samples or send them to designated institutions for safekeeping. The warning, first reported by Caixin and viewed by the AP, prohibited laboratories from posting on the virus without government authorization. The order prevented Shi's laboratory from publishing the genetic sequence or warning of the potential danger.Chinese law states that research institutes cannot conduct experiments on new potentially dangerous viruses without the approval of the major health authorities. Although the law is intended to keep experiments safe, it does offer top health officials broad decision-making powers over what lower-level labs can or cannot do.""If the virology community had operated more autonomously ... the public would have been informed long before the lethal risk of the new virus,"" said Edward Gu, professor at the University of Zhejiang and Li Lantian, a doctoral student at Northwestern University. , in an article published in March analyzing the epidemic.Commission officials later repeated that they were trying to ensure the safety of the laboratory and had charged four separate government laboratories to identify the genome at the same time to obtain accurate and consistent results.By January 3, the Chinese CDC had independently sequenced the virus, according to internal data seen by the Associated Press. And shortly after midnight on January 5, a third designated government laboratory, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, had decoded the sequence and presented a report - pulling all night owls to get results in record time, according to an interview released by the media . (!)Yet even with complete sequences decoded independently of three state laboratories, Chinese health officials have remained silent. The WHO reported on Twitter that investigations were underway into an unusual group of deathless pneumonia cases in Wuhan and said it would share ""more details as we have them.""Meanwhile, gaps in the coronavirus experience have proven to be a problem at the Chinese CDC.For almost two weeks, Wuhan did not report any new infections, while officials censored doctors who warned of suspicious cases. Meanwhile, researchers had discovered that the new coronavirus used a distinct spike protein to bind to human cells. The unusual protein and lack of new cases led some Chinese CDC researchers to think that the virus did not spread easily among humans - such as the coronavirus that causes Middle East respiratory syndrome, or MERS, according to an employee who he refused to be identified for fear of punishment.Li Yize, a University of Pennsylvania coronavirus researcher, said he immediately suspected the pathogen was contagious when he discovered a leaked copy of a sequencing report in a group chat about a SARS-like coronavirus. But the Chinese CDC team working on the genetic sequence lacked molecular specialists and failed to consult external scientists, Li said. Chinese health authorities have rejected offers of assistance from foreign experts, including Hong Kong scientists excluded from a fact-finding mission in Wuhan and an American professor at a university in China.On January 5, the Shanghai Public Clinical Health Center, led by the famous virologist Zhang Yongzhen, was the last to sequence the virus. He sent it to the GenBank database, where it was waiting to be reviewed, and notified it to the National Health Commission. He warned them that the new virus was similar to SARS and probably infectious.""It should be contagious through the respiratory tract,"" the center said in an internal notice, seen by the AP. ""We recommend taking preventive measures in public areas.""On the same day, WHO stated that, based on preliminary information from China, there was no evidence of significant transmission between humans and did not recommend any specific measures for travelers.The following day, the Chinese CDC raised the emergency level to the second highest. The staff proceeded to isolate the virus, draft guidelines for laboratory tests, and design test kits. But the agency had no authority to issue public notices and the high emergency level was also kept secret by many of its staff.By January 7, another team at Wuhan University he sequenced the pathogen and found that it matched Shi's, assuring Shi that he had identified a new coronavirus. But Chinese CDC experts said they didn't trust Shi's findings and needed to verify his data before he could publish, according to three people who were familiar with the matter. Both the National Health Commission and the Ministry of Science and Technology, which oversees Shi's laboratory, have refused to make Shi available for an interview.An important factor behind the gag order, some say, was that Chinese CDC researchers wanted to publish their articles first. ""They wanted to take all the credit,"" said Li, the coronavirus expert.Internally, the leadership of the Chinese CDC is plagued by fierce competition, explain six people familiar with the system. They said the agency has long promoted staff based on how many documents they can publish in prestigious journals, making scientists reluctant to share the data.As the days passed, some Chinese CDC staff members also began to wonder why the authorities were taking so long to identify the pathogen.""We were becoming suspicious because sequencing would result within a day or two,"" said a lab technician, refusing to be identified for fear of punishment.On January 8th, the Wall Street Journal they reported that scientists had identified a new coronavirus in samples of pneumonia patients in Wuhan, anticipating and embarrassing Chinese officials. The lab technician told AP that he first learned about the discovery of the virus from the Journal.The article also embarrassed WHO officials. Dr. Tom Grein, head of the WHO acute event management team, said the agency looked ""doubly, incredibly stupid"". Van Kerkhove, the American expert, acknowledged that the WHO was ""already late"" in the announcement of the new virus and told colleagues that it was essential to push China.Maria van Kerkhove, head of the Outbreak Investigation Task Force for the World Health Organization, at a news conference in Geneva. (Martial Trezzini / Keystone via AP)Ryan, the WHO chief of emergencies, was also troubled by the scarcity of information.""The fact is that there are two to three weeks to an event, we don't have a laboratory diagnosis, we don't have an age, gender or geographic distribution, we don't have an epi curve,"" he complained, referring to the graph epidemic standards that scientists use to show how an epidemic is progressing.After the article, state media officially announced the discovery of the new coronavirus. But even then, Chinese health authorities did not release the genome, diagnostic tests, or detailed patient data that could suggest how contagious the disease was.At that time, suspicious cases had already appeared across the region.On January 8, Thai airport officials snatched a woman from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat and high fever. The team of Professor Supaporn Wacharapluesadee of Chulalongkorn University found that the woman had been infected with a new coronavirus, just as described by Chinese officials. Supaporn partially understood the genetic sequence by January 9, reported it to the Thai government and spent the next day looking for matching sequences.But since the Chinese authorities had not published any sequence, it found nothing. He could not prove that the Thai virus was the same that sickened people in Wuhan.""It was a bit of a wait and see when China will release the data so we can compare it,"" said Supaporn.On January 9, a 61-year-old man with the virus died in Wuhan - the first known death. Death was not made public until January 11th.WHO officials complained during internal meetings that they made repeated requests for additional data, especially to find out if the virus could spread efficiently among humans, but to no avail.""We have requested further epidemiological information informally and formally,"" said the Chinese representative of WHO Galea. ""But when we asked for details, we couldn't get anything.""Emergency chief Ryan complained that because China was providing the minimum information required by international law, WHO could not do much. But he also noted that last September, the WHO had issued an unusual public rebuke from Tanzania for not providing enough detail about a worrying Ebola outbreak.""We have to be consistent,"" said Ryan. ""The danger now is that, despite our good intentions ... especially if something happens, the WHO will be pointed out.""Ryan noted that China could make a ""huge contribution"" to the world by immediately sharing the genetic material, because otherwise ""other countries will have to reinvent the wheel in the coming days.""On January 11, a team led by Zhang from the Shanghai Public Health Clinic finally published a sequence on virological.org, used by researchers to exchange tips on pathogens. The move angered the Chinese officials of the CDC, said three people who were familiar with the matter, and the following day his laboratory was temporarily closed by the health authorities.Zhang made a request for comment to the Chinese CDC. The National Health Commission, which oversees the Chinese CDC, has repeatedly refused to make its officials available for interviews and has not answered questions about Zhang.Supaporn then compared her sequence to Zhang's and found that it was a 100% match, confirming that the Thai patient was ill with the same virus found in Wuhan. Another Thai laboratory achieved the same results. Thailand informed WHO that day, said Tanarak Plipat, deputy director general of the Department of Disease Control at the Thai Ministry of Public Health.After Zhang released the genome, the Chinese CDC, the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences ran to publish their sequences, working overnight to review them, collect patient data and send it to National Health Commission for approval, according to documentation obtained from the AP. On January 12, the three labs together finally released the sequences on GISAID, a platform that allows scientists to share genomic data.A giant TV screen at a quiet shopping mall in Beijing shows President Xi Jinping talking to medical workers at the Huoshenshan Hospital in Wuhan in March. (AP Photo / Andy Wong)More than two weeks had passed since Vision Medicals decoded a partial sequence and more than a week since the three government laboratories had obtained complete sequences. About 600 people were infected that week, an increase of about three times.Some scientists argue that the wait was not unreasonable considering the difficulties in sequencing unknown pathogens, as precision is as important as speed. They point to the SARS epidemic in 2003 when some Chinese scientists initially - and erroneously - believed that the source of the epidemic was chlamydia.""The pressure is intense in a blast to make sure you're right,"" said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealthAlliance in New York. ""It's actually worse to go out to go to the public with a story that is wrong because the public completely loses faith in the public health response.""However, others ask what happened behind the scenes.Infectious disease expert John Mackenzie, who served on a WHO emergency committee during the outbreak, praised the speed of Chinese researchers in sequencing the virus. But he said that once the central authorities were involved, the detailed data ended up in a scan.""Certainly there was a kind of empty period,"" said Mackenzie. “There had to be a man-to-man transmission. You know, he's staring at you ... I thought they would have been much more open at that point. ""On January 13, WHO announced that Thailand had a confirmed case of the virus, shaking Chinese officials.The next day, in a confidential teleconference, the main Chinese health official ordered the country to prepare for a pandemic, calling the epidemic the ""most serious challenge from SARS in 2003"", as previously reported by the AP. Chinese CDC staff across the country began screening, isolating and testing cases, presenting hundreds of them across the country.Yet even though the Chinese CDC internally declared a level one emergency, the highest possible level, Chinese officials still claimed that the possibility of prolonged transmission between humans was low.WHO has gone back and forth. Van Kerkhove said in a press conference that ""it is certainly possible that there is a limited human-to-human transmission."" But hours later, the WHO seemed to be going back and it has tweeted that ""preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have not found clear evidence of human-to-human transmission"" - a statement that later became fodder for critics.A senior official in the WHO office in Asia, dr. Liu Yunguo, who attended Wuhan medical school, flew to Beijing to establish direct and informal contacts with Chinese officials, a show of recordings. Liu's ex-classmate, a Wuhan physician, warned him that pneumonia patients were flooding the city's hospitals, and Liu pushed other experts to visit Wuhan, according to a public health expert who is familiar with with the matter.On January 20, the leader of a team of experts returning from Wuhan, the well-known government infectious disease doctor Zhong Nanshan, publicly stated for the first time that the new virus was spreading among people. Chinese President Xi Jinping called for the ""timely publication of information on the epidemic and the deepening of international cooperation"".Respiratory specialist Zhong Nanshan attends an oath-taking ceremony via video connections for two new probationary Communist Party members in Wuhan. (Deng Hua / Xinhua via AP)Despite this directive, WHO staff still had difficulty obtaining sufficient and detailed patient data from China about the rapidly evolving epidemic. On the same day, the United Nations health agency sent a small team to Wuhan for two days, including Galea, the WHO representative in China.He was told of a troubling group of cases among more than a dozen doctors and nurses. But they had no ""transmission trees"" that described in detail how the cases were connected, nor a full understanding of the spread of the virus and who was at risk.At an internal meeting, Galea stated that their Chinese counterparts ""speak openly and consistently"" about the human-to-human transmission and that it was debated whether or not this was supported. Galea reported to colleagues in Geneva and Manila that China's key request to the WHO was for help ""in communicate this to the public, without causing panic. ""On January 22, WHO convened an independent committee to determine whether to declare a global health emergency. After two inconclusive meetings in which the experts were divided, they decided not - although Chinese officials did they ordered Wuhan to be sealed in the biggest quarantine in history. The next day, WHO chief Tedros publicly described the spread of the new coronavirus in China as ""limited"".For days, China did not release much detailed data, even though its case count had exploded. Beijing city officials were alarmed enough to consider blocking the capital, according to a medical expert with direct knowledge of the matter.On January 28, Tedros and top experts, including Ryan, did an extraordinary trip to Beijing to meet President Xi and other senior Chinese officials. It is very unusual for the WHO Director-General to intervene directly in the practical aspects of outbreak investigations. Tedros' staff had prepared a list of inquiries.""It could all happen, the doors open, or there is no communication,"" Grein said in an internal meeting while his boss was in Beijing. ""We'll see.""At the end of Tedros' trip, WHO announced that China had agreed to host an international team of experts. In a press conference on January 29, Tedros then praised China, calling his level of commitment ""incredible"".The next day, the WHO finally declared an international health emergency. Once again, Tedros thanked China, without saying anything about the previous lack of cooperation.""We should express our respect and gratitude to China for what it is doing,"" said Tedros. ""He has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.""Source: https://apnews.com/3c061794970661042b18d5aeaaed9fae",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Why is the deputy minister for health Sileri under escort?,"""The deputy minister M5s of Health Pierpaolo Sileri he ended up under escort after denouncing corruption attempts and threats with respect to its political activity and in particular with regard to the allocation of public funds for the coronavirus emergency. The Prosecutor of Rome has opened a file against unknown persons for ""serious threats"": the deputy minister has already been heard by the magistrates and for about a week he has been accompanied by a public security officer. No official comment from the exponent M5s and his staff: ""I once heard a person who said the more you climb to the top and the stronger the wind blows"", he limited himself to say in the late afternoon, guest of Radio 1 Rai. ""I think it is our duty to give our best and the risks increase"".According to the indiscretions reported by the news agencies, among the people involved in the investigation there is also a senior executive in the healthcare field, with managerial roles between Rome and Calabria. The threats date back to the last period of the coronavirus emergency and have been going on for weeks. ""So he wrote Il Fatto Quotidiano on May 26, 2020.News confirmed by several colleagues, for example Vito Crimi, deputy minister of the interior, who tweeted ""My most sincere solidarity and closeness to the deputy minister of health Pierpaolo Sileri, forced to move under escort after threats received on the destination of funds for the Covid emergency 19. Pierpaolo, and with him the whole 5 Star Movement, are not intimidated. Go on like this"".But just the next day, on the same site, another article appears, of a completely different opinion and tenor: the article entitled ""Fontana, Azzolina, Sileri under escort: politics has little to do with anything. There is something more worrying"" tells us another version, claiming that the three political figures ended up under escort for different reasons, namely: ""attacks by organized groups of professional haters who work to poison the social climate. "" But how, the day before there was an ongoing corruption attempt, complete with an open file in the prosecutor's office, and the next day instead of magically the ""senior manager in the health field"" who would be involved and the corruption attempts related to destination of public funds no longer talk? By the way, this news seems to have received little echo from the mass media. Why? It may seem, to a cynical eye, that the arrival of the escort for other political figures and for other reasons has, so to speak, ""obscured"" the story concerning Sileri and which recalls motivations quite different from ""social tensions"". Still in the same cynical eye, the doubt may also arise that this thing risks making people feel comfortable, who, of corruption in the healthcare system, does not want to hear about it. Least of hypothetical attempts to ""condition"" public funds .... in full emergency.Now the real threats are social tensions, the real problems are the dissatisfied people who threaten via the web (according to some ""chased"" by political movements that blow on social unease). By highlighting the threats via the web received by Azzolina and Fontana, however, attempts at corruption, retaliation, serious threats connected to public funds are no longer mentioned. Look'.It will be that we live in Italy and we have been used to hearing about corruption too often, it will always be that the more confused and tense the situation the easier it becomes to distract attention, in the end we are no longer scandalized at all and above all, it becomes almost automatic to hide the dust under the carpet and pull straight. However, on issues like these, citizenship would have the right to know more. Deputy Minister Sileri should perhaps inform citizens more about the pressures he received, at least which specific sectors of health care would have involved, because if this emergency affects us all and the measures taken to manage it are having negative results on the whole Italian population both economically and socially, citizens have the right to greater transparency and any offenses should be publicly condemned and disclosed, even more so those involving the public sector.We just have to wait, in the absence of further ""indiscretions"", the outcome of the investigations of the Prosecutor. In the meantime, we hope that the bribe attempt denounced by the deputy minister will not end in oblivion of the media centrifuge of these months.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Flop vaccine, one of the most popular causes ""serious injuries"" in 20% of those tested","Disappointing results on the breed horse of the pharmaceutical and technological lobby. May cause ""serious adverse events"" and ""injuries"". Work is also being done on the inoculation of the artificial wild virus, which ""has already caused deaths"". But even the results of the competitors do not bode wellThe results concerning the experimentation of the Moderna vaccine, the breed horse of the pharmaceutical and technological lobby on which magnates had aimed as Bill Gates and controversial epidemiologists like Anthony Fauci. A first balance does it Children's Health Defense, movement created to protect the health of minors coordinated by Robert F. Kennedyjr.But what do the results say? Nothing that bodes well for someone to think about volunteering. 'Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high-dose group - they write from the organization - underwent a ""serious adverse event"" within 43 days of receiving the Modern jab. Moderna did not release its clinical trial study or raw data, but its press release, which was carried away with inconsistencies. He acknowledged that three volunteers developed systemic grade 3 events defined by the FDA as ""preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention"".In practice the company not only would not have published the data relating to human experimentation yet, but it would stand still hiding reality behind good turns of words. That is, that in some cases the administration of the vaccine has caused such adverse reactions that it ""requires medical intervention"". Whoever deludes himself to participate in the experimentation in search of (presumed) prevention tools, must therefore count on entering in a hospital ward that he could have avoided without a vaccine. A paradox, of course, which however in times of fake epidemics and fake pandemics becomes possible.""A vaccine with such reaction rates - they warn from Children's Health Defense based on the percentages provided by Moderna itself - it could cause serious injuries in 1,5 billion humans if given to ""every person on earth"". This is the threshold that Gates has set to put an end to the global blockade. ""It is not enough because the even more worrying obstacle has yet to come, and it concerns the inoculation of the"" wild covid virus "". And here the massacre is at hand : ""Both humans and animals have obtained a robust antibody response, then they got sick and died when exposed to the wild virus.

 STUDY: ASYMPTOMATIC COVID-19 NON CONTAGIOUS,"We publish a study just released in which it ends that the infectivity of some asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 ""could be weak"". In practice they followed all contacts (455) of a positive Covid-19 asymptomatic and found that none had been infected. It is legitimate to ask more than a few questions in a historical moment in which citizenship (even pediatric) is forced to wear masks even outdoors and where they are trying to convince us that ""social distancing"" is necessary to protect ourselves and others. ABSTRACTBackground: An ongoing coronavirus outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide. It is questionable whether carriers of asymptomatic COVID-19 viruses are contagious. Here we report a case of the asymptomatic patient and present the clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers.Material and methods: 455 contacts that were exposed to the carrier of the asymptomatic virus COVID-19 became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staff. We extracted epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary test results and therapeutic programs.Results: the average contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% of the patients' original diseases. In addition to the hospital staff, both patients and family members were medically isolated. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member experienced new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most frequent. The blood count in most contacts was within a normal range. All CT images showed no signs of COVID-19 infection. No coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was detected for severe acute respiratory syndrome in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test.Conclusion: in summary, all 455 contacts have been excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2 may be weak.Link to the study: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32405162/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Financial speculation suspicions behind the Moderna vaccine announcements,"Pump'n'dump. That is, inflate the ratings of a title with more or less real news and then sell, when the price has skyrocketed. Jurassic Park stuff of speculation, good script material Wall Street and Gordon Gekko's cynic festival jokes. Yet in the world of algorithmic and high frequency finance, certain practices still seem to work. And the serious thing is that suspicion about this not exactly orthodox strategy is gathering around something that the world awaits with anxiety and hope: the Covid-19 vaccine.At the heart of the dispute is the Modern, bio-pharmaceutical company that has monopolized the record day at the start of the week on the US Stock Exchange, placing a net plus 19% compared to the last close of last week at $ 80 per share. The reason? Guest of Cnbc, The company's CEO, Stephane Bancel, said that their experimental vaccine, mRNA-1273, offered excellent results in the pre-clinical experimental phase. Bingo!This despite, in reality, the tests were based solely on two low-dose trials on only 8 patients and that the only real finding was non-harmfulness for health. It matters little, a world gripped by the pandemic amplifies everything. Wall Street then multiplies it.There is a problem, however, as the graph shows: in after-hours trading the stock fell to 77 dollars. The reason? With timing worthy of a centometrist, the management of Moderna just closed the negotiations announced a public offer of securities for 1,25 billion dollars of equivalent in a range between 75 and 77,50 dollars per share.Morgan Stanley was delighted to offer herself immediately as sole book running manager operation. In short, in the eyes of the most experienced traders the whole move seemed little more than a salesman operation to place securities on the market at + 15-20% compared to the last closure.Perhaps, it's a promotional stock sale. And that's not enough.Why not alone Stephane Bancel appears as a very active stock seller of his company, according to the movements of the last few weeks but this screen shows how the top holder of Moderna, Flagship Pioneering Inc. is also selling a lot.Definitely quite a lot. Coincidentally, Bancel would also be the controller of that company.And that's still not enough. Because moments after the announcement of Moderna, the entire US bio-pharmaceutical sector followed suit, announcing public offers of stocks: Kristal Biotech, Clovis, Bellerophon, Novavax and Hexo, the latter not very quick to seize the timing of the operation and forced to announce only the placement in the near future, without even indicating a price fork.Will it be true medical-scientific glory in the name of public health and the fight against the ""big evil"" or just an operation of low speculation in the short term?Only time will offer an answer to the suspects, for now this graph shows how the recent precedent for Gilead's Rendesivir, a drug whose anti-viral properties were magnified by Dr. Fauci himself, by sending the title to the stars, does not testify to the inscription of May 18 as a great day for medical progress.Finally, the pearl.As reported by the US edition of Business Insider, the newly designated head of the national task force to combat coronavirus, Dr. Moceaf Slaoui, not only was he the director of Modernarole abandoned to be able to access the position offered to him by Donald Trump but continues to hold $ 10 million in the company's stock options, which of course is also benefiting from federal research funding.In short, a potential - and quite striking - case of conflict of interest.Which are they going to join now i suspected of pump'n'dump by Modernain the face of the lockdown, citizens in intensive care and thousands of victims.Net of the witch hunt against Bill Gates or the cheap conspiracies, one thing becomes clearer and clearer as the days go by: not only the search for the anti-Covid vaccine is a billionaire business but it risks turning into a race with no holds barred, a rollerball financial-scientific for people with few scruples.

 Burundi expels WHO officials who coordinate the coronavirus response,"A letter from the Foreign Ministry seen by the Associated Press states that the WHO representative in Burundi, Walter Kazadi Mulombo, has been declared. ""Unwelcome person"" and must leave the East African nation by Friday May 15. The letter also mentions three other WHO experts, dr. Walter Kazadi Mulombo coordinator of the country's coronavirus, dr. Jean Pierre Mulunda Nkata - head of communicable diseases, dr. Ruhana Mirindi Bisimwa - COVID-19 test expert, Professor Daniel Tarzy.These you read were the first lines of an article that we were about to write about the latest news from Africa, but something was wrong and we have deepened. The most glossy news sources accuse the government of Burundi of having acted to avoid alleged interference with the upcoming elections, and all reaffirm the need to have qualified experts, those of the WHO, to help the Nation overcome the Covid crisis19. According to the unified network information wave, the WHO suggested the government to limit the elections as a possible source of epidemic outbreaks and at that point the Foreign Minister, in fact, ordered the experts to leave the country ... end of story ?As always, things are more complex than they appear. One of the experts now expelled from Burundi, the Dr. W. Kazadi Mulombo, in a tweet of May 8, 2020, denied the news of The Jerusalem Post where his name was made about a trial of an Israeli anti-HIV drug, Gammora, in the context of the Covid-19 epidemic. So a member of the WHO on the front lines in Burundi in handling the Covid19 emergency, dissociates himself from an article calling him ""A despicable example"". The article referred precisely to an anti-HIV drug, defined miraculous for Covid patients19, but it must be contextualized well. There is talk of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where, at the time of the experimentation, there were 300 infected people whose health we do not know, out of a population of 84 million people (to understand today it has just over 1200) and many pan-African states they had opposed the experimentation on the African population both with vaccines and with antivirals or with drugs in general since, rightly, they reiterated their unwillingness to use their citizens as laboratory mice on which to experiment with any drug (as already widely happened in the recent past ). Add to this that the name of the Dr. Mulombo is approached to a used company to false claims scientific. How the site writes HIV Cure, la Israeli company Zion Medical works on sensational press releases on phantom studies that attest to even more phantom beneficial effects of their drug Gammora and this, in an explosive situation where many authoritative pan-African members have firmly opposed the experimentation in Africa, made the position of Mulombo very critical of the eyes of politics.We would have liked to finish our study here, but the situation is perhaps much worse than what the media say. The Burundian government actually decided to chase the experts already under accusation for articles on alleged trials, after a journalistic investigation entitled ""The WHO rattrapée for l"" Ebola business """" (WHO passed by ""Ebola business""). The investigation, signed by journalists Emmanuel Freudenthal and Joao Coelho, has made a lot of noise in many African states: emails and documents would show that some WHO employees who intervened for the Ebola epidemic in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018, they would be at the center of a $ 2 million (1,8 million) month ""Ebola"" business. Expert-owned cars, several, rented for $ 3.000 per vehicle per month. A real fortune in a country where the average monthly income does not exceed the equivalent of 50 euros.To confirm the accusations of journalists we find the statements of dr. Michel Yao, who coordinates Ebola's response to the WHO, in which he clearly says that ""It is not acceptable ... they can no longer do their job with all the necessary probity."" Some of the people involved in the journalistic investigation into the Democratic Republic of the Congo are precisely the same expelled from Burundi today.As you can see, ""truth"" does not exist, reality is so complex and full of variables that it is impossible to determine which version is right, if the experts were an obstacle to free and democratic elections and therefore Burundi placed democracy in the foreground compared to the Covid19 emergency, or if everything is due to a total loss of confidence in the WHO experts, disgraced in half the world for small or large alleged steals. To you to deepen and understand, certainly the WHO is not shining in transparency.Source:",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

" ""Covid is like HIV: we will never have the vaccine""","The important statements of Pasquale Mario Bacco who, with a team of doctors, in February had discovered that the virus had already been circulating since last October""There will be no vaccine"", says Pasquale Mario Bacco without too many words, medical health insurance lawyer, who with a team of thirteen colleagues, in his laboratory based in Bari, he has studied Covid-19 for a while and already at the end of February, given by hand, he had shown that lung infection has been circulating in Italy since last October.""We were interested in understanding the incidence where the disease did not occur,"" he says ilGiornale.it Bacchus.The medical team took a sample of 7038 healthy and symptom-free people, all employees of companies, carried out serological tests starting from 25 February and it was discovered that over 30 percent of the Italian population had come into contact with Covid-19 developing antibodies. We speak, in particular of 33,6 percent. 7.038 people were positive out of 2.365.Of these 2.365 subjects, 1.779 were present with IgG, i.e. immunoglobulin G dated, let's talk about Covid antibodies. ""It means that these people had already come into contact with the virus at least three and a half months before, they got sick and developed antibodies, although they are asymptomatic"", specified Bacchus (almost 90 percent of the infected people analyzed did not show anyone of symptoms attributable to Covid).Of course the antibodies are not for life, they last a few months, which is why it is impossible, according to the words of the doctor from Campania, to find a vaccine. ""In this Covid is like theHiv. They are viruses that change. It may be that the population will be called to undergo the vaccine in June, but that same vaccine will no longer be needed in October. I have seen in the laboratory how this virus changes, it is almost like HIV, so there will never be a vaccine. The only thing that will save us, if the virus becomes more aggressive, is a specific drug. Today serum-positive subjects have a life expectancy equal to a healthy subject, thanks to a drug. They lead a normal life only that they have to take one, two or three, but usually one pill a day because they have a retroviral that goes into the blood and this helps. And the same will be true for Covid, ""says the doctor.Nobody, however, in the Italian scientific field, wanted to give credit to the study of Bacchus and his colleagues. ""In'college of the Health neither the ministry of health have considered us. Then we brought our data to Professor Burioni and he didn't even see them""Bacco said, embittered. Currently there are 30.395 deaths due to Covid in Italy, according to data published on the internet, but according to Dr. Bacco, those numbers""they were invented from a healthy plant""because"" Covid deaths that were previously healthy are counted on the fingers of one hand because this virus is not capable of killing. It is a trivial, simple virus. For example, a serum-positive subject does not get sick of Covid, because he has HIV which is a much larger virus that uses the same receptors as Coronavirus, so even in competition, Covid cannot go on the same receptors. Wherever there is an adequate immune response, it is annihilated. ""According to the declarations of Bacchus, i deaths who were hospitalized in hospices, or who had plurimetastatic tumor pathologies, dilated, diabetic, paraplegic myocardiopathies, cannot be considered deaths for Covid, because ""they are all subjects who already had very short life expectancy"". The Coronavirus family absolutely suffers from the climate,""This can also be told by a second-year medical student""Bacchus underlines. Therefore, from the study carried out by the Bari group, Covid-19, like all coronaviruses, was determined (and importantly, it was already at the end of February) and is conditioned by the climate. summer and then reappear with falling temperatures and, moreover, it will always manifest itself in a more incisive way in the colder areas of Italy. ""Even at equal 'concentration' - reads the report of the team of scholars - the pathogenicity of the virus will be increasingly greater in the North, compared to Southern Italy and Southern Europe (where temperatures, even in winter, are higher) "".""The real question that should be asked today is: but this virus ad October how do you come back? Because the virus has not disappeared, it exists and survives""Bacchus specifies. So how will we get out of it?""With the discovery of a drug specific"", replies dryly, Bacchus. Today, according to the doctor from Campania, there are three solutions to the virus (until you find the right drug for Covid)."" We have hydroxychloroquine which is now useless to take, but not in October. Let me give you an example, the characteristic of Mediterranean anemia is that of the hemoglobin chains. Hemoglobin, simply called, is composed of an alpha and a beta part (let's talk about polypeptide chains, ed). Betatalaxemia subjects (therefore those suffering from Mediterranean anemia) do not have beta chains. Covid binds to beta chains, therefore these patients are not immune to covid because they do not have the virus, can enter their body, but does not bind. American scholars have understood this. That said, hydroxychloroquine has a very trivial mechanism (which approaches the concept of Mediterranean anemia, ed.), It is used for malaria. Taking this drug first, the beta chains are buffered, if the virus enters the body that has taken this medicine, it does not know where to bind and if it does not enter the cells, it dies. And it is not true that it has a thousand side effects as one of the television professors said. ""Of course, it is not the solution, but it is fine pending the official drug. The second drug is Tocilizumab, the anti-arthritis drug used in the hospital ""Cotugno"" of Naples that works because it reduces the body's reactions in contact with the virus. Finally there is the therapy with plasma ""which is what will save us if this virus becomes more aggressive"".Source: https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/covid-lhiv-non-avremo-mai-vaccino-1861905.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Coronavirus, Zaia: ""If it loses strength it means that it is artificial""","'I say something that will anger someone: if the virus loses strength it means that it is artificial. A virus doesn't lose strength with this speed, if it loses strength then it probably could be artificial in nature. A lot has been written about this virus, it goes away so fast in my opinion there is something artificial about it ''. This was said by the president of the Veneto region, Luca Zaia, in the usual live Facebook press point. reopenings - Activities? '' I hope the government decides to say something in these hours. If they had decided not to present new decrees, therefore in theory to open everything from the 18th, it is essential that we tell the citizens, we cannot say on the 17th in the evening the commercial activities open tomorrow morning. It doesn't work like this: we open but in a programmed way. We must also organize our prevention services. I also hope that the guidelines are reasonable and do not complicate citizens' lives. A table every 4 meters? If you put it in your home and not in a restaurant, it would mean closing all restaurants. Scientific exercise is one thing, real life is another. I hope the prime minister will appear on TV tonight and tell us something. I understand that yesterday he already had a report from the technical-scientific committee on the progress of the infection during the week, I imagine that the prime minister tells the country what he wants to do. If you want advice: make a Dpcm with a single article, in which he says the Regions are delegated, in the face of the presentation of a plan, to the reopenings ''.Cable cars and lifts? ''We support the reopening of everything. We no longer have Ateco codes, according to us in compliance with the health indications, we are to try to reopen everything. And so do my fellow governors, '' said Zaia.MASKS - As for the masks, '' we are receiving many photos of people who do not use the mask. It must be clear that if you do not use the risk of reopening outbreaks and recontagation is high, the risk is to thunder back with quarantines and to give reason to those who say it should not be opened. It is a minimal commitment that we ask, the appeal to everyone is to do team action. We get pictures of people at the supermarket with or without a mask around their neck. The use of the mask is essential, relapse would be a tragedy, even from an economic point of view, it would mean closing all activities '' he warned.THE BUDGET - Then, taking stock of the cases in Veneto, the governor explained: '' We have reached 432 thousand tampons, 10 thousand more than yesterday. There are 5.163 people in isolation, 340 fewer than yesterday, isolation is also falling. The positives in Veneto are 18.671, 53 more than yesterday. We are not concerned about numbers.

Meanwhile, the secret services of five nations are pointing their finger at Beijing for the management of the pandemicThe US returns to attack China heavily, accuses Beijing of having done everything to hide Covid-19, and re-launches the thesis according to which the virus was born in a Wuahn laboratory, going so far as to affirm that there is ""enormous evidence"" . To launch the latest attack, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, who in an interview with ABC, did not want to say whether he thinks that the virus was released intentionally, because, he explained, China ""continues to prevent Westerners access to laboratories "".Beijing, he added, ""is known for its propensity to infect the world and use poor laboratories. This is not the first time the world has been threatened by Chinese laboratory viruses, we must be able to go there. We do not have the virus samples yet. we need "", warned the head of US diplomacy, accusing China of having done"" everything possible to ensure that the world did not know in time "".US President Donald Trump has never spared criticism of China's handling of the first outbreak in the city of Wuhan in December and last week said he had evidence that it was leaked by a Chinese laboratory, as scientists and WHO continue. to believe that the virus was transmitted from animals to humans after emerging in China, probably from an exotic animal market in Wuhan.Pompeo's claims come on the day when the secret services of five countries make harsh accusations against China on the management of the pandemic, in particular on the origin of the pandemic. A dossier of the so-called ""Five Eyes"" alliance composed of the 007 of the USA, Great Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, says that Beijing would have tried to cover up what happened at the beginning and points the index on the ""risky"" methodologies used in a Wuhan laboratory.The 15-page document speaks of an ""attack on international transparency"" and the 007s point out that until January 20 China had denied that the virus is transmitted among humans, when there would have been clear evidence already at the beginning of December.German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also asked China for ""transparency"" about the origin of the coronavirus: ""The whole world has an interest in the origin of the virus being clarified,"" said the head of German diplomacy. ""But well-founded answers must be given by science, not by politics: in this China can test how transparently Covid-19 actually means"". Source: https://www.agi.it/estero/news/2020-05-03/coronavirus-pompeo-prove-enormi-partito-da-laboratorio-wuhan-8505400/#",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Blood tests in Japan reveal: coronavirus mortality is lower than influenza,"Kobe City General Medical Hospital study on a thousand blood samples: only 0,01% died due to Covid. The prudence of scientists: do not let your guard downTOKYO. The mortality of covid19 could be far lower than what scientists had previously believed. Even one in ten thousand. This is what emerges from a study conducted by Kobe City Medical Central General Hospital that collected 1.000 blood samples from patients who visited the hospital in late March and early April.Patients with coronavirus symptoms were excluded from the sample. Of these thousand 33 people, or 3,3% tested positive for Covid19 antibodies.If the analyzes were confirmed by further tests in other prefectures of Japan, the mortality of Covid19 would plummet to 0.01%, or even lower than the seasonal flu.The doctors who performed the tests remain cautious as they are still samples taken exclusively from outpatients, but the director of the hospital, Kihara Yasuki, has however reiterated that there is a high possibility that many more people have actually been infected from Covid19 with respect to the hypotheses made so far. To these data are added hundreds of patients affected by the seasonal flu who had already noticed ""unusual"" symptoms in January.Kobe is one of the most cosmopolitan Japanese cities, so that Covid19 arrived here already at the end of last year is not at all improbable. This discovery could have significant consequences not only from a psychological but also a practical point of view: it could lead to a lightening of the emergency measures taken starting from mid-April. Closing of schools, cancellation of events and request to clubs and restaurants to remain closed.And it is this latter recommendation that has had the most devastating repercussions. When the curve of the infected by Covid19 returns to levels that are no longer alarming, it will be necessary to count not so much the excess deaths caused by the virus but those due to the consequences of the closure of the economy.How many small entrepreneurs, restaurant owners fall into the cold statistics of the 1700 suicides that occurred in March it is difficult to establish it but in the chronicles of these days heartbreaking stories emerge. Like the manager of an izakaya in Sapporo who hanged himself after getting into debt to renovate the club in view of the Olympics which were then postponed. Same fate for the owner of a tonkatsu restaurant (fried cutlets) well known in Nerima, north of Tokyo, who has chosen to set himself on fire in his restaurant.And it is precisely because stories like these are now on the agenda if the governor of Osaka thinks of easing emergency measures already from mid-May.Source: https://www.lastampa.it/esteri/2020/05/04/news/test-sul-sangue-effettuati-in-giappone-rivela-la-mortalita-da-coronavirus-e-di-gran-lunga-inferiore-all-influenza-1.38801430",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 A company kicks off the production of 40 million units of a vaccine before it even knows if it will work,"Il largest vaccine manufacturer in the world is mass-producing a coronavirus vaccine developed by the University of Oxford without even knowing if it works.The Serum Institute of India - which produces 1,5 billion vaccine doses each year for a range of diseases - has said it will start production earlier than the fall date for the completion of Oxford research.The Oxford Vaccine Group says it hopes to complete human tests of the hAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine in September.Thursday, ai first two humans were injected with the vaccine in Oxford. Around 1.100 people in the UK will be injected as part of the process, which is funded by the British government.""We could get enough data in a couple of months to determine if the vaccine works, but if transmission levels drop, this could take up to six months,"" the group said Thursday.The research team plans to produce one million doses of the vaccine itself by September.But Adar Poonawalla, CEO of the Serum Institute of India, has told the Times of India Monday that would not have waited so long.Said that the institute will produce five million units of vaccine per month for six months to anticipate demand.""We are not waiting for the tests to end in September in the UK, to then begin production here. The decision - at our risk and cost - it was taken solely to make a leap forward in production, to have enough doses available, if clinical studies prove effective, ""he said.“Our goal is to produce four to five million doses per month for the first six months, following which we could increase up to 10 million doses per month, based on the success of the tests. We are trying to produce up to 20-40 million doses by September-October"".“We are planning to make it vaccine available at an affordable price of around 1.000 rupees ($ 13) in India""He said. Drug prices vary widely around the world, and the same treatment often costs much more in other countries.Professor Sarah Gilbert, who is leading the Oxford mission to secure a vaccine, has declared on April 11 that September is a realistic dateto expect a vaccine that can work.""I think there is a high probability that it will work based on other things we have done with this type of vaccine,"" he said.Poonawalla had previously declared to Business Insider India that his company would not have patented the vaccine.""We don't want to make money and market anything above a sustainable level in such an epidemic that puts public health at risk,"" he said.About 80 vaccines are currently being developed worldwide, according to the BBC.Oxford scientists started developing a vaccine on January 10 and have declared on March 18 to have found a promising candidate.Gilbert and his team previously developed a vaccine for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS).Source: https://it.businessinsider.com/unazienda-da-il-via-alla-produzione-di-40-milioni-di-unita-di-un-vaccino-prima-ancora-di-sapere-se-funzionera/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Wuhan's Franco-Chinese bacteriological bomb: Le Monde's investigation into a Chinese laboratory,"The evidence is not there but the suspicion remains.

And above all there is a woman, an expert Chinese scientist, who could clarify what really happened in Wuhan's laboratory. Her name is Shi Zhengli, 55, and she is responsible for the most research on the viruses brought by bats. Perhaps the Lady of the Bats or BatWoman, as she is called, could resolve many doubts: the French know her perfectly because she was trained in Lyon in the Jean-Merieux high security laboratory and for her degree thesis she spent a few years in Montepellier.For France, Wuhan's laboratory is a bloody wound to national pride that affects us all. Le Monde dedicates two pages of reports with news and interviews on the famous Wuhan P4 laboratory totally built by the French, with Chinese researchers trained in Lyon but where French researchers have never been able to set foot despite an agreement that provided for their presence. The only one who has entered and knows something, René Courcol, an infectious disease specialist, keeps his mouth shut. Not only that: the Chinese about the virus did not pass any information on to the French. According to the Ministry of Defense, France at the time would have delivered a sort of ""bacteriological bomb"" to Beijing. There is still no evidence that the coronavirus came out of there but the suspect, even in China, remains. One thing is certain: Chinese opacity is total and there are serious doubts that cooperation with Beijing will continue.The Wuhan P4 laboratory was born in 2004 from an initiative wanted by French President Jacques Chirac and Chinese President Hu Jintao with the official goal of consolidating an alliance against possible epidemics such as Sars. But in France not everyone agreed. A report from the Foreign Ministry reads: ""The Chinese are trying to develop a research program on bacteriological weapons like others,"" recalls Gerard Araud, who was director of strategic affairs at the time. But Foreign Minister Dominic Villepin insisted: in 2003 France had opposed the American and Western intervention in Iraq against Saddam Hussein and Paris was looking for new diplomatic shores in Moscow and Beijing.Thus it was that France began to build the laboratory and also finance the training of Chinese researchers who had to become familiar with the procedures of a P4 type laboratory: these laboratories are those that treat viruses at the highest contagion and mortality rate . It is no coincidence that Wuhan's took a long time to be completed and inaugurated: the official ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Bernard Cazeneuve, takes place with great pomp on 23 February 2017. But already in May 2018, according to an article in the Washington Post of April 14, the American services are warned, in all likelihood by the French themselves, that ""the Wuhan laboratory presented technical and safety procedures flaws"".In fact, after the initial enthusiasm, the French had received a loud slap from Beijing. At the end of 2017, a report arrives to Yves Le Drian - Prime Minister of Defense and then of Foreign Affairs with Macron - very little encouraging: no French researcher out of the 50 planned had been able to set foot in the new P4 laboratory. The only one who entered was the infectious disease specialist René Courcol but it is not known where he was taken and to which premises and facilities he actually had access. Of all those interviewed by Le Monde is the one who did not want to make statements. Tight-lipped.And to think that the French ambassador in Beijing in 2016 had pinned the Legion of Honor on the chest of Wuhan laboratory director Yuan Zhiming and the bat and virus hunter, Batwoman Shi Zhengli. Here is how things went in the lake mists of Wuhan: neither the Chinese authorities nor the two scientists awarded with the Legion of Honor have passed on to Paris the minimum useful information to fight the pandemic that is sinking the whole world. A total failure as cooperation.In March, Chinese writer Yan Geling from Berlin published a literary essay on Covid-19. To describe the attitude of the Chinese authorities towards this epidemic, it borrows three words from an ancient poem by the poet Tang Wan (1130-1156), ""hide, hide, hide"" (man, man, man). He repeats it three times: as a warning perhaps it may be enough.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

" According to Montagnier, the coronavirus was manipulated for an AIDS vaccine","The revelations of the Nobel Prize on the French podcast 'Pourquoi Doctor': ""Intervening on a genome is a work of sorcerer's apprentices but nature does not accept these manipulations and, over time, eliminates them"".Coronavirus is said to be a manipulated virus, accidentally released from a Chinese laboratory in Wuhan where the AIDS vaccine was being studied. This was stated by Professor Luc Montagnier, Nobel Prize for Medicine 2008, to the microphones of the French podcast, specialized in medicine and health, ""Pourquoi Doctor"".According to Professor Montagnier, who in 2008 discovered he discovered HIV as the cause of the AIDS epidemic along with Francois Barré-Sinoussi, Sars-CoV-2 is a virus that was accidentally processed and released by a Wuhan laboratory specializing in coronavirus research in the last quarter of 2019.""With my colleague, the biomathematician Jean-Claude Perez, we carefully analyzed the description of the genome of this RNA virus ""explained the Nobel in his interview with Dr. Jean-Francois Lemoine."" We were not first, a group of Indian researchers tried to publish a study showing that the complete genome of this virus which has within the sequences of another virus, that of AIDS. The Indian group retracted after publication. But the scientific truth always emerges. The AIDS sequence was inserted into the coronavirus genome to attempt to make the vaccine. "" According to the scientist, the altered elements of this virus will still be eliminated as it spreads: ""Nature does not accept any molecular manipulation, it will eliminate these unnatural changes and even if nothing is done, things will improve, but unfortunately after many deaths"" . In addition, Montagnier added who also gave his solution: ""With the help of interfering waves, we could eliminate these sequences - he explained - and consequently stop the pandemic. But it would take a lot of means available"".""So - added Montagnier - the history of the fish market is a beautiful legend but it is not possible that it is just a virus transmitted by a bat, it is probably from this that they started, then they modified it. Maybe they wanted to make a vaccine against AIDS using a coronavirus as a vector of antigens. A work of sorcerer's apprentices can be said. Because we must not forget that we are in the world of nature, there are balances to respect. Nature eliminates the sequence of the coronavirus genome "".Conspiracy? ""No - replies the professor - the conspiracy theorist is the one who hides the truth. I believe, however, that in this case it is the Beijing government that has hidden things. But the truth comes out as I said. But 'errare humanum est', and there is no need to make accusations now nor to open investigations. China is a great country and I hope it will be able to recognize an error ""he concluded.Source: https://www.agi.it/estero/news/2020-04-17/coronavirus-montagnier-wuhan-8364636/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Covid-19: tests, analysis and vaccines. What future awaits?","by Nassim Langrudi, April 13th, 2020 - thanks to Chiara Remedia for translationA few days ago the idea of ​​an ""immunity passport"" has entered the public discussion on the Covid19 emergency measures.I have waited before sharing some of my thoughts about this topic, but sadly this idea seems to be concretely confirmed…. Why am I saying “sadly”? Some people at first may consider it a great idea to verify people's immunity, a perfect response to the quarantine measures; yet ...Let's just assume: currently no one really knows a thing about this ""virus"" acquired immunity.Will it be permanent? No one knows.How long the eventual Sars-COv-2 immunity will last, it hasn't been evaluated with reasonable confidence. What has been confirmed, however, is that - like the whole Coronavirus family - this variant too is susceptible to rather important mutations: ""The genotyping analysis shows that the genes encoding the S proteins and RNA polymerase, RNA primase, and nucleoprotein, undergo frequent mutations. These mutations are critical for vaccine development in disease control. ""https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10965Clearly this uncertainty on the acquired immunity makes the whole immunity passport debate a non sense.Some questions arise: does being immune mean no longer being a healthy carrier? Who decided it? Where is it proven?An individual, normally, can be immune to a certain disease, because coming into contact with it, he acquires natural immunity in a symptomatic or asymptomatic way, is that right?However, when it was unequivocally proven, once this immunity has been acquired, the individual would cease carrying this virus, in case he met it? Who said that the virus would stop harboring in the body?Because, if this fact can't be proved, and it can't, we are facing an hysterical delusion.A virus acquired immunity allows the body to recognize that virus so when we come in contact with it again we won't develop the disease: it is not a shield that prevents from coming into contact with the virus !!!What are we then blabbering about?""A subject can be defined as a healthy carrier when he has been infected by a pathogen and he is hosting the pathogen with no signs of any pathology: these are usually immunologically resistant subjects (mostly having previously acquired immunity), where microorganisms live as saprophytes , who can infect close people, especially if they are less resistant ""But let's take a step back, before technically and scientifically discussing about the (NON) validity of the proposal, because in my opinion a “philosophic” reasoning is required: what are we heading towards by legitimizing this idea? Are we really starting to discuss issuing a kind of ""immunity certificate"" to allow, or not, people to live in the world as ""normal"" individuals?Are we really considering, in these days, to limit personal freedoms, of movement, enjoyment of goods and services, by subjecting them to a virus immunity ???It seems to me an absurd and paranoid hypochondriac dystopia, but I must acknowledge that, unfortunately, these delusions are being given a lot of space by the media: we are now reading every day about this innovative strategy ... but where are we heading to?Are we willing to introduce (and accept) the idea that individuals, human beings, need to prove their immunity to some pathogen in order to have the right to move freely? Coronavirus today, and who knows what else tomorrow? Is it only me shuddering to think of it as a real possibility? Are we realizing what the implications are?But we have already gone further with hypochondriac atrocities, take for example the swab mania: ""you have to do the swab"" and thus demonstrate that you are - or not - a virus carrier at a given time. This is already happening, and the call for nasopharyngeal swabs full-scale over the population.Trifles like test reliability are underestimated, because gee, we are in emergency !! Thus, the possibility of refusing a medical test (and the right to privacy) is affected, in the name of a test that, given the emergency, hardly matters if it provides potential false positive or false negative, and what percentage !!For example this article mentions a concerning percentage of these swabs' inaccuracy and unreliability.Therefore, we are evaluating political, social and health strategies, not supported by sufficient scientific reliability.Obviously, all of the above opens up to a logical need to be very, very cautious about a vaccine against this ""disease"": if we don't have reliable data on the rate of mutation and on circulating serotypes, and on the persistence of any acquired immunity, how can I preview the effectiveness of a vaccine? And how do these considerations affect an almost non-existent evaluation of the adverse reactions and of the vaccine safety? In fact, another basic aspect we must not overlook is the safety of a hypothetical vaccine (which, according to the latest news, would be in the human trial phase already). We've had many official statements about the very short testing time in this particular case, which obviously affects the pre-clinical safety tests indeed, these very same tests we have been, until recently, reassured about the ""very long"" testing times for the vaccines. As of yesterday, faced with demands of scientific evidence for these drugs' safety, we were told that it was guaranteed by years of study, whereas today Villani is telling us that testing time is ""normally"" two years: ""Normally - he said - at least two years are needed to develop a vaccine, on this particular occasion the times will certainly not be the same "". What the implications?In conclusion, in my view great caution is needed considering the different proposals we are reading of these days: - the indiscriminate use of unreliable diagnostic tools- the feared “necessity” to somehow tie to a hypothetical ""immunity"" the people's return to a semblance of normalcy- the call for a vaccine with the above assumptionsAs always, all we have to do is watch over the evolution of the events and facts, keeping in mind that any restriction of civil and constitutional rights is likely to be permanent.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Giulio Tarro: “Coronavirus is not Ebola, the vaccine is not needed. Healthcare in crisis due to those who have halved intensive care ""","The wait for a coronavirus vaccine may be unnecessary: ""Self the virus looks like a Chinese variant and a Po valley, it will be complicated to have one that works in both cases exactly as it does for flu shots that don't cover everything. ""Giulio Tarro he is an internationally renowned virologist, disciple of Albert Sabin - father of the polio vaccine - of which he directed the laboratory after his disappearance. In Italy, however, it is much discussed also for the frequent remote confrontations with the web star Roberto Burioni: “I don't want to make controversy, but it is curious - Tarro says - that we still listen to those who at the beginning of February said that the risk of contracting the virus was zero because in Italy it circulated, when it had already been around for some time ”.The fight against the virus has divided experts into factions with the parts that - often - tend to discredit themselves, but Tarro, born in 1938, does not seem interested in the rumors:“Today we are informed on the internet, at my age and from the height of my experience I keep away. I isolated the cholera vibe in Naples, I fought the AIDS epidemic and I defeated the dark evil of Naples, the respiratory virus'sincinziale ' which caused high mortality in children from zero to two years suffering from bronchiolitis "". Retired primaryCotugno hospital of Naples - the only second Ernesto Burgio to have ""adequate protections for doctors"" - has been in the front line against many influences and for this reason he recalls that “neither for the first Sars, nor for the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East vaccines were prepared, however, the antibodies of the healed subjects were used"".As if to say that the key to return to normal is in the development of one antiviral therapy effective, “a cure that could also arrive for the summer. I hope science and heat can be allies. And I trust that we can go to swim. Too many people talk about the coronavirus without having the support of scientific data and without the right knowledge"".Tarro is convinced that around Covid-19 there is a lot of exaggeration because despite being “a rather particular virus, fortunately it does not have the same mortality as Sars and not even Mers who killed one in three patients. Today we are not fighting Ebola, but our enemy is a disease that is not lethal for almost 96% of the infected ”.They would therefore be a series of contributing factors to the crisis in the Lombard health system: “The problem - continues the professor - is in the remaining 4% that broke loose at the same time. In practice, in less than a month we had the same flu patients as an entire season. A wave that was impossible to cope with due to health cuts in recent years. According to the WHO, intensive care beds were halved between 1997 and 2015. And worse, we weren't fast enough to repair the damage. ""According to the expert Italy - and Lombardy in particular - wasted too much time between the declaration of the state of emergency on January 31 and the activation of ad hoc measures to deal with the emergency""Because when we got the news from China, the French intervened immediately on the intensive care places and we didn't? We preferred to block flights with China: a really useless measure. Not to mention the chaos masks. The truth is that at the beginning we did not have them so it was said that they should use them are doctors and patients, then we became masks producers and therefore we say that they are useful to everyone. It's incredible, everyone had to be told immediately to use them and keep their distanceinstead, one mess after another was made. We wanted to armored Lombardy like China and then thousands of people were allowed to migrate to the south ... Frankly it was not clear what the government's approach was and containment measures were taken late"".The communication strategy also does not convince the expert:""The alarm is a source of stress and stress, paradoxically, causes a decrease in the immunological defenses. All the experts know it, yet every day we see these unnecessary numbers communicated by the Civil Protection. There are data that don't mean anything: we do not know the precise number of infected people and consequently we are faced with a very high mortality rate. If we go to see some English studies, however, we discover that the infected would be many more: according to a study by the University of Oxford even 60-64% of the entire population; at least 6 million for Imperial College. With these estimates, the death rate drops dramatically. I think we will get below 1% as in China. ""Pending an effective antiviral, the expert does three hypotheses on the end of the epidemic:“It could completely disappear like the first Sars; reappear like Mers, but in a regionalized way or become seasonal like bird flu. For this, a cure is needed more than a vaccine. The fact that it does not take root in Africa gives me hope for the summer"".Source: https://it.businessinsider.com/giulio-tarro-coronavirus-non-e-ebola-il-vaccino-non-serve-la-sanita-e-crisi-per-colpa-di-chi-ha-dimezzato-le-terapie-intensive/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

Intestinal samples of sick pigs were ground and used to feed other pigs.Ministers say that while the latest information does not contest the zoonosis of the virus - originating from animals - it can no longer be ruled out that the virus initially spread to humans after ""escaped"" from a Wuhan laboratory.Last week, further doubts were expressed about the animal market theory after Cao Bin, a doctor from Wuhan Jinyintan hospital, highlighted research showing that 13 of the first 41 patients diagnosed with infection had had no contact with the market. ""It seems clear that the fish market is not the only origin of the virus,"" he said.The 30 million pounds sterling from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, the most advanced laboratory of its kind on the Chinese mainland, is located ten miles from the infamous wildlife market.Last night, Anthony Bellotti, president of the White Coat Waste group, condemned his government for spending many dollars in China, adding: ""Reportedly, animals infected with viruses or otherwise sick and mistreated in Chinese laboratories could be sold to markets for consumption once the experiments were performed""American MP Matt Gaetz said: ""I am disgusted to learn that for years the United States government has funded experiments in dangerous animals at the Wuhan Institute, which may have contributed to the global spread of coronavirus and research in other laboratories in China that have virtually no oversight by of the U.S. authorities.

Well, when would it have been established unequivocally that once acquired this immunity I would cease to carry this virus, in case I met it? Who said the virus would stop ""harboring"" in my body? Because if this fact is not demonstrable, and it is not, we are facing a hysterical delusion. Immunity acquired by a virus allows my body to recognize it and not to develop the disease anymore when I get in touch with it again: it is not a shield that prevents me from coming into contact with it !!!What are we babbling about?""A subject can be defined as a healthy carrier when it has been contaminated by a pathogen and hosts the pathogen without presenting any pathology: these are usually immunologically resistant subjects (usually thanks to a previously acquired immunity), in which microorganisms live as saprophytes, but that can infect close people, for example if they are less resistant ""But let's try to take a step back, because even before discussing the technical (scientific) validity of this proposal, it is in my opinion fundamental to make a ""philosophical"" reasoning: what are we going to meet by clearing this hypothesis? Are we really starting to discuss issuing a kind of ""immunity certificate"" to allow people to live in the world as ""normal"" individuals or not? we are really considering, in these days, to be able to limit personal freedoms, movement, enjoyment of goods and services, making them immune to a virus??It seems to me an absurd and paranoid hypochondriac dystopia, but I must take note that, unfortunately, these delusions are being given a lot of space in the media: we now read every day statements on the merit of this innovative strategy ... where do we want to go?Do we want to introduce (and accept) the idea that individuals, people, must demonstrate that they are immune to some pathogen in order to have the right to move freely? Coronavirus today and who knows what else tomorrow? Do I just get the shivers thinking of this as a real possibility? Do we realize the implications?   But we are already going further with hypochondriac atrocities, take for example the buffer mania: ""you have to do the swab"" and thus demonstrate that he is - or is not - the carrier of the virus at a given moment. This is already happening, and recourse to the use of nasopharyngeal swabs at full spread over the population. Tricks like the reliability of the test are underestimated, because jeez, we're in an emergency! Thus, the possibility of refusing to undergo a medical analysis (and the right to privacy) in the name of a test that, given the emergency, does not matter if it provides potential false positives or false negatives, nor in what percentage! ! For example In this article there is a worrying% of unreliability of the tests used (so-called ""swabs"").  Therefore, we are evaluating political, social and health strategies that are not supported by sufficient scientific reliability.   Obviously, all of the foregoing opens up to a logical need to go very, very cautiously on the use of a vaccine against this ""disease"": if I do not have reliable data on the rate of mutation and on circulating serotypes, if I do not have reliable data on the persistence of any acquired immunity, how can I predict the effectiveness of a vaccine? And this, how does it affect the acceptability of an almost null evaluation of the adverse reactions of the safety a vaccine? Because another fundamental aspect on which we do not postpone is precisely the safety of a hypothetical vaccine (which according to the latest news is already being tested on humans). There are already numerous official declarations on the fact that in this case very short testing times are necessary, which obviously affects precisely the pre-clinical safety tests, those same tests that until recently assured us that we would normally require ""very long"" testing times ""for vaccines. Until yesterday, in the face of requests for scientific evidence on the safety of these drugs, we were told that it was guaranteed by years of study, while today Villani informs us that the years of experimentation are ""normally"" two: ""Normally - he recalled - it takes at least two years to develop a vaccine, on this occasion the times will certainly not be the same ""  . With what implications?In short, in my opinion extreme caution is urgently needed in the various proposals we are reading about in these days:  - the indiscriminate use of unsafe ""diagnostic tools - the feared need to subordinate in some way the resumption of a semblance of normality of people to a hypothetical ""immunity"" - the invocation of a vaccine with the above conditions.   As always, all we have to do is watch over the evolution of the facts, keeping in mind that any denunciation of civil and constitutional rights is likely to be permanent.",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 World Health Coronavirus Disinformation,"LWHO bows to Beijing, compromising the global response to the pandemicThe coronavirus pandemic will offer many lessons about what to do next time to save more lives and reduce economic damage. But there is already a way to prevent future pandemics from being so lethal: Reform or take away funds from the WHO.Last week Florida Senator Rick Scott requested a congressional investigation (Parliamentary inquiry) on the United Nations agency ""role in helping Communist China to hide information about the Coronavirus threat."" The dirty relationship with the WHO goes beyond the exchange of effusions with Beijing, but it is a good starting point.The coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan, China in the fall, perhaps as early as November, and accelerated in December. Caixin Global reported that Chinese laboratories had sequenced the coronavirus genome in late December but received orders from Chinese institutions to destroy the samples and not to disclose the results of their research. On Dec. 30, Dr. Li Wenliang warned the Chinese doctors of the virus, and several days later the local authorities accused him of lies that caused ""a serious disturbance to the social order"".Taiwanese institutions warned WHO on December 31 that they had evidence that the virus could be transmitted from man to man. But the agency, bowing to Beijing, has no normal relationship with Taiwan. On Jan. 14, WHO tweeted ""Preliminary investigations conducted by the Chinese authorities have not found clear evidence regarding human-to-human transmission."" The agency took another week to reverse this disinformation.On Jan 22-23, an WHO emergency commission was discussing whether to declare Covid-19 a ""public health emergency of international concern"". The virus had already spread to several countries and making such a statement would have better prepared the world. It should have been an easy decision, despite Beijing's objections. However, general manager Tedros Ghebreyesus declined and rather went to China.Finally, he made the statement on January 30 — losing a week of precious time — and his rhetoric suggests that the trip to Beijing was more about politics than public health. ""The Chinese government deserves our congratulations on the extraordinary measures it has taken,"" he declared. ""I started with absolute certainty about China's commitment to transparency"".A study from the University of Southampton suggests that the number of coronavirus cases could have been reduced by 95% if China had moved 3 weeks earlier to contain the virus. However, Dr. Tedros said that Beijing had set up ""a new standard for responding to the epidemic."" He also praised the speed with which China ""sequenced the genome and shared [the discovery] with the WHO and the rest of the world"". China did not do this until January 12th.On 30 Jan. Dr. Tedros also declared that ""WHO does not recommend limiting trade and circulation"". President Trump ignored the advice and announced restrictions on travel to and from China the next day, slowing the spread of the virus. The progressive American elites referring to WHO criticized Trump. WHO did not declare coronavirus a pandemic until March 11th.Not that all this prompted an examination of conscience. Alluding to China, WHO officer Michael Ryan said last week ""We must also be very careful not to outline some parts of the world as uncooperative."" Beijing made propaganda of these statements, as well as other WHO statements.This relationship is tragic but not surprising. Much of the blame for the WHO failures lies with Dr. Tedros, who is a politician, not a medical doctor. As a member of the left wing of the Tigray People's Liberation Front, he grew up in the autocratic government of Ethiopia as Minister of Health and Foreign Affairs. After taking up the post of general manager in 2017, he attempted to install Zimbawe dictator Robert Mugabe as a goodwill ambassador to WHO.China inevitably gains more international influence as its economy grows. But why does the WHO seem to fear Beijing's anger much more than Washington's? Only 12% of the estimated member states' contribution to WHO comes from China. U.S. contributions are 22%. The Americans towards the WHO are genuinely loyal to the institution, while Chinese officials put China's interests ahead, otherwise they would suffer Beijing's outrage.China's influence on the WHO has been organized and coherent, while the U.S. response has been random. Washington needs a full back to lead the fight against China for the dominance of the WHO and other international organizations. However, the Office of the State Department for International Organization Affairs lacks a political officer.The United States will have allies in an effort to reform the WHO. The frustrated Japanese vice minister called WHO ""the Chinese Health Organization"". British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is reportedly rethinking the UK-China laws over the lack of bluntness towards the virus.Congress should investigate how the WHO has acted against the coronavirus and whether its judgments have been corrupted by China's political influence. Of all the international institutions, the WHO should be the least politicized. Its main mission is to coordinate international efforts against epidemics and to provide honest public health guidance.If the WHO is just a politicized Maginot Line against epidemics, then it is worse than useless and should no longer receive funding from the United States. And if foreign policy elites want to know why so many Americans distrust international institutions, WHO is the reason.Source: https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-health-coronavirus-disinformation-11586122093",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" As the pressure for the coronavirus vaccine increases, scientists discuss the risks of accelerated testing","SEATTLE RISKEARLY SIGNALS CHICAGO (Reuters) - le farmaceutiche stanno lavorando il più rapidamente possibile per sviluppare un vaccino per combattere il coronavirus in rapida diffusione che ha infettato oltre 100.000 persone in tutto il mondo.Dietro le quinte, gli scienziati e gli esperti medici sono preoccupati che velocizzare l'iter di approvazione di un vaccino potrebbe finire per peggiorare l'infezione in alcuni pazienti piuttosto che prevenirla. Gli studi suggeriscono che i vaccini contro il coronavirus comportano il rischio di ""potenziamento del vaccino"", dove invece di proteggere dalle infezioni, il vaccino può effettivamente peggiorare la malattia quando una persona vaccinata viene infettata dal virus.  Il meccanismo che causa tale rischio non è completamente compreso ed è uno dei blocchi che ha impedito lo sviluppo efficace di un vaccino contro il coronavirus. Normalmente, i ricercatori impiegherebbero mesi per testare la possibilità di potenziamento del vaccino negli animali.  Data l'urgenza di arginare la diffusione del nuovo coronavirus, alcuni produttori si stanno muovendo direttamente in test umani su piccola scala, senza attendere il completamento di tali test sugli animali. ""Capisco l'importanza di accelerare le tempistiche per i vaccini in generale, ma da tutto quello che so, questo non è il vaccino con cui farlo"", ha dichiarato il Dott. Peter Hotez, preside della National School of Tropical Medicine del Baylor College of Medicine a Reuters. Hotez ha lavorato allo sviluppo di un vaccino per la SARS (sindrome respiratoria acuta grave), il coronavirus alla base di un grave focolaio del 2003, e ha scoperto che alcuni animali vaccinati hanno sviluppato una malattia più grave rispetto agli animali non vaccinati quando sono stati esposti al virus. ""Esiste il rischio di potenziamento immunitario"", ha affermato Hotez.  ""Il modo in cui riduci tale rischio è innanzitutto dimostrare che non si verifica negli animali da laboratorio."" Hotez ha testimoniato la scorsa settimana davanti al comitato della Camera degli Stati Uniti su scienza, spazio e tecnologia sulla necessità di finanziamenti per la ricerca sui vaccini.  There is no vaccine left for any of the new coronaviruses that have caused outbreaks in the past 20 years.At least for now, world experts have concluded that accelerated tests are a risk worth taking.During a World Health Organization (WHO) meeting specifically convened in mid-February, designed to coordinate a global response to the new coronavirus, scientists representing government-funded research organizations and manufacturers around the world agreed that threat was so great that the vaccine would have to switch rapidly from human testing before animal testing is complete.""If you want to get a vaccine as quickly as possible,"" former WHO deputy director-general, Marie-Paule Kieny, who chaired the meeting, told Reuters, ""You have to balance this with the risk you put on a very limited number of people and do everything you can to mitigate the risk as much as possible. ""The conclusion of that meeting, which was not open to the media, was not officially publicized by the WHO. It does not reflect any official position adopted by WHO, a United Nations body whose job is to help shape global health policy.Regulatory oversight of drug manufacturers and research is in the hands of national regulators. The most powerful of these, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has reported that it is in agreement with the consensus and will not stand in the way of accelerated testing programs.""When we respond to an urgent public health situation such as the new coronavirus, we intend to exercise regulatory flexibility and consider all data related to a given vaccination platform,"" said FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo in a statement. The agency did not specifically comment on animal tests for vaccine enhancement.Coronavirus vaccine developers are still required to conduct routine animal tests to make sure that the vaccine itself is non-toxic and can help the immune system respond to the virus.About 20 coronavirus vaccine candidates are being developed by research institutes and manufacturers including Americans Johnson & Johnson and France's Sanofi SA. The US government has allocated over $ 3 billion for coronavirus treatments and vaccines.The biotechnology company Moderna Inc, which works with the U.S.-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH), is closest to testing humans, announcing plans to start testing with 45 people in Seattle this month.Testing for the specific risk of vaccine enhancement in animals will proceed simultaneously with human trials, NIH told Reuters, which said it should determine if it is safe to expose more people to the vaccine. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.The plan complies with WHO consent and FDA requirements, said Dr Emily Erbelding, director of the microbiology and infectious diseases division of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The trial is expected to last 14 months, an NIH spokeswoman said.Dr. Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, expressed doubts about this approach. ""This is important, but it must be done in a way that reassures scientists and the public that these (vaccines) are not only effective, but safe,"" he told Reuters.Hotez said he was surprised that human tests were going on. ""If there is an improvement in the immune system in laboratory animals vaccinated with the Modern vaccine, this is a sight,"" he said.The American immunotherapy company Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with a Chinese company, also plans to launch human clinical trials on 30 U.S. volunteers in April instead of waiting for animal studies on vaccine enhancement.""The community as a whole has evaluated this and said that we do not want to delay the clinical process. We have been encouraged to go to Phase 1 studies as quickly as possible,"" Inovio CEO Joseph Kim told Reuters.The company plans to launch human security trials shortly thereafter in China and South Korea, two countries that have been hit hard by the virus. Kim said he expected to have an answer to the question about vaccine enhancement later this year.The Moderna / NIH study is enrolling patients at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The choice of location, made several weeks ago, could prove problematic.To reduce the risk to volunteers, scientists from the WHO meeting recommended manufacturers to limit early clinical trials to small groups of healthy people and to take them to places where the virus is not spreading, according to Kieny, who now he works at the French research institute Inserm. This reduces the chances that people taking the vaccine may encounter the virus and trigger a more serious reaction.Ever since the location was chosen, the Seattle metropolitan area has emerged as the epicenter of infections in the United States. Washington state reported 162 coronavirus infections and 22 deaths, out of a total of 755 infections and 26 deaths in the country as of Tuesday, according to a count from Johns Hopkins University.However, Moderna and the NIH are planning to move forward.""We think there is no reason to have to change sites. If you change it, there might be a community broadcast on another site in the next two weeks,"" said Erbelding. “Any risk of this for the participants is very small. It would be manageable as the process progresses. People are observed very, very carefully. ""Tragic experiences from other vaccines and previous work on coronaviruses have raised some warning flags for developers.The best-known example occurred in a U.S. study in the 60s of a vaccine created by NIH and licensed to Pfizer Inc to fight the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes pneumonia in infants. The vast majority of children who received the vaccine developed a more serious disease and two children died. A more recent example occurred in the Philippines, where around 800.000 children were vaccinated with Sanofi's dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. Only later did the company learn that it could increase the risk of more serious diseases in a small percentage of individuals.Research, including that conducted by Hotez, has shown that coronaviruses in particular have the potential to produce this type of response. But testing the risk of vaccine enhancement takes time because it requires scientists to breed genetically modified mice to respond to the virus like humans. Work on these and other animal models has just begun in several laboratories around the world.Modern, Inovio and many other vaccine developers are not waiting for this process to complete and are planning to launch human studies in record time for a virus discovered only in December.Both Moderna and Inovio claim that their vaccines have a lower risk of vaccine potentiation because they are made using newer technology that focuses on specific genes on the external spike portion of the virus. The coronavirus vaccines that caused the vaccine to potentiate were generally made using an inactive version of the whole virus. Neither company has so far produced an authorized vaccine.J&J said it is developing animal models to test vaccine enhancement and hopes to have a vaccine candidate ready for human testing in October. A Sanofi spokesperson said the company will look into this risk before testing the vaccine in clinical trials.""People know how traumatic the RSV experience has been,"" said Dr. Johan Van Hoof, global head of Janssen Vaccines, J&J vaccination unit. ""When you see signs in animals like this, we shouldn't ignore them.""Source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-vaccines-insight/as-pressure-for-coronavirus-vaccine-mounts-scientists-debate-risks-of-accelerated-testing-idUSKBN20Y1GZ",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 The origin of the virus will remain unknown,"But where did this damned Sars-Cov2 come from? The Lancet and Nature report that the infection began to spread in the first half of December 2019 with 41 cases of pneumonia with an unclear cause in the city of Wuhan, capital of Hubei province in China. Again according to these sources, the first case dates back to December XNUMXst.It had been said that probably, given the uses of slaughter and sale of different animals in these typical Chinese markets, as had happened with the Sars coronavirus, also for this new virus the origin had been a ""wet"" market (markets where all types of domestic and wild animals are sold and slaughtered) in the city of Wuhan. However, it was soon ascertained that the first recorded case was a personwho had not gone to the Wuhan fish market. ""The appearance of symptoms in the first patient identified dates back to December 2019, 41,"" reads The Lancet: ""None of his family members developed fever or other respiratory symptoms."" At the moment, moreover, ""there are no epidemiological links between the first patient and the other cases"". To complicate the picture, the results of studies carried out on the first 27 cases examined by the Chinese research group led by Chaolin Huang of the Jin Yintan hospital in Wuhan: 66 subjects (equal to 10%) had been on the market since December XNUMX, others do not.So where did this new coronavirus come from (alone or accompanied)? Around the corner is the conspiracy hypothesis which has also taken on an official profile. It is a Chinese government official who accuses the Americans of having introduced him (involuntarily) during the international military games held in Wuhan in November 2019.Natural or laboratory-built virus? A paper highlighted strange evidence of HIV protein coronavirus inserts: Uncanny similarity of unique inserts in the 2019 - nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 from the Kusuma School of Biological Sciences, University of Delhi, India. The research was strangely withdrawn two days after publication. Much more successful was instead a recent publication in Nature of March 17, ""The proximal origin of Sars-Cov2"" - The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, Ca, Usa - which ensures, without a shadow of a doubt, that it is a virus natural. However you want to think about it, there is no transitive property that claims natural virus = virus not spread voluntarily or escaped from the laboratory. Nobody can claim nor will ever know the truth.MARIA RITA GISMONDO director of clinical microbiology and virology of the ""Sacco"", Milan",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" The accusation of the virologist Crisanti: ""Ricciardi and WHO errors: lost a month on asymptomatic","Finger also pointed at the Chinese: ""They lied to the world and did not communicate the fundamental theme of transmission""Rapid serological testsThe virologist did not use mincing words to talk about what he judges a ""irresponsible attitude""by WHO, which continues to say that the transmission takes place by symptomatic subjects: yet 30 days ago through the Veneto Region these data were transmitted, but for WalterRicciardi - adviser to Health Minister Roberto Speranza - they could not be taken into consideration ""without a scientific publication"". The article is now ready and awaits revision""of one of the most prestigious magazines in the world"". There was a warning against Rome:""Have lost time precious, this is not how an epidemic is faced"".The Director of Microbiology of the University of Padua refused to attack the government's work. His finger is in fact pointed at the WHO: ""I Chinese they lied to the world and did not communicate the fundamental issue of the transmission of the virus by asymptomatic subjects. But theWHO, who went to China to do inspections with a task force, what checks did she do?"".In the interview given to The Daily Made The topic of the next steps to be taken was also touched: in his opinion, it is necessary to intervene quickly, circumscribing the outbreaks and identifying all the positives. Another step would be to go back to to sample, to see if someone has escaped after some time: ""It is clear that it cannot be done on an entire city, but a city is never completely infected, there are also clusters there, small Vo '"". The model can therefore be applied""al grouping urban, neighborhood, group of houses""But it is necessary to go to investigate and actively monitor and that is precisely""that Italy has not yet been able to do"". If our country had been prepared, with the capacity to make 100 thousand tampons per day,""we would have cut this epidemic"".Crisanti then spoke of the rapid serological tests: he would judge them ""undoubtedly useful""if there was the certainty that""work"", but is currently""very cautious""He finally made it clear that there were no problems with the governor LucaZaia, but with an official from the Region who had not given the go-ahead to the tests on asymptomatic: subsequently the intentions were understood and confidence was given to its approach. ""I do it only because it's right, I don't want to be pulled by the jacket, my contribution is purely scientific and not political""concluded the virologist.Source: https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/cronache/laccusa-virologo-crisanti-i-cinesi-hanno-mentito-mondo-1849915.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 USA: Experts warn that 1 in 3 coronavirus test results may be incorrectly negative,"An alarming new report from the The Wall Street Journal suggests that almost one in three patients who are infected with COVID-19 turn out to be false negatives. ""A false negative is problematic because it tells the patient that he doesn't have the virus,"" explained Dr. Craig Deligdish to the newspaper.Estimating incorrect results is based on limited data, but the concern that the tests may be far from accurate is worrying. As Deligdish has observed, it means that people who have been reassured that they are not contagious are probably going on and spreading the disease to others.Health experts also told the Wall Street Journal that part of the problem with the tests is the speed with which they were approved. ""The different thing this time is that most of these tests are going through a very rapid validation process,"" said Ohio State University epidemiologist Bill Miller. ""As a result, we cannot be completely sure of their effectiveness."" Other doctors have already collected the wrong results.The new guidelines for sick Americans ask that if you have coronavirus symptoms, suppose you have COVID-19. ""Research from China indicates that the false negative rate may be around 30 percent,"" he writes Harlan M. Krumholz of the New York Times. ""Some of my colleagues, laboratory medicine experts, express concern that the false negative rate in this country may be even higher.""Curiously, it doesn't seem to go the other way. The Times added, ""the tests seem to be highly specific: if the test turns positive, it's almost certain that you have the infection.""

" Coronavirus, what happened in that Piacenza clinic in February? The true story of a contagion boom","Coronavirus in Piacenza: the true history of the Sant'Antonino clinical caseSant'Antonino private clinic, Piacenza. A clinic accredited with the health service that with ""Casa Piacenza"", its ""twin"" and of the same property (the medical director Mario Sanna), is at the center of a very disturbing case: patients, doctors, head nurse, oss, nurses, women of the cleaners who get sick of Coronavirus already in mid-February, or maybe even earlier, and no information comes out of there. As long as the Everyday occurrence, on March 18, uncover the pot: a cleaning lady dies and it turns out that weeks earlier an old man with the Coronavirus was quickly taken away from the facility.The Sant'Antonino private clinic, questioned by me on March 6, is silent on everything saying to ask Ausl, the director of the Ausl of Piacenza Luca Baldino tells me that what happens there does not interest him and that he has more important things to deal with . On March 13, the Ausl of Piacenza announces that Sant'Antonino becomes Covid specialized clinic and thanks the clinic for its ""sensitivity"" in an official statement. And therefore, it is perhaps the time to add all the details of the story, including the various testimonies collected and the new ""answers"" from the management of the Casa Piacenza and Sant'Antonino, even if once again substantially they attribute all responsibility to the Local Health Authority of Piacenza.History In mid-February, when Coronavirus seems not to have arrived in Italy yet, the elderly patient Gino B., admitted to the Sant'Antonino clinic, feels ill. He begins to have a constant fever, which does not go down. In the clinic they think it depends on the fact that his bed is located next to the heater. However, that fever does not pass and at a certain point his neighbor also gets sick. Some doctors are also sick. On February 24, in the clinic, news arrives that Dr. Cremonesi, a retired doctor who carried out some operations at the Piacenza clinic, was hospitalized in Tenerife while he was on vacation: he has Coronavirus. The newspapers and news reports also mention it, but the name of the Piacenza Clinic is never associated with the fact.Officially, nothing happened in there. No official communication from the owner Mario Sanna, no communication to the families of hospitalized patients, no official communication to all staff. Gino, the old man found positive, is taken away a few days later. On March 16, Monica Rossi, a cleaning lady from Casa Piacenza, is found dead at home. “I could have saved her, I will never forgive myself! I will live my life with this cross on my shoulders! Excuse me if you can Monica! ”, The staff manager of Casa Piacenza Laura Cappellano writes on Facebook.So what happened from mid-February to that March 16, in the private clinics Casa Piacenza and Sant'Antonino? Many things, and all well silenced by the care manager Nawal Loubadi, by the daughter of the owner Lidia Sanna and by all the managers of the structures. Many employees have continued to work, since that February 24, in a condition of uncertainty and fear, always discovering in reverse ways, for the confidences of doctors, nurses, oss, that the disease was turning in the clinics and that many of them are they were getting sick. Someone had been infected and ""went on vacation"" or ""got sick"" in a hurry. The word ""Coronvirus"" was taboo.After the cleaning lady's death, however, everything changes. Employees start talking. And many people contact me. An oss from Sant'Antonino tells me, between a cough, the other: “There have been dozens and dozens of positive people for over a month. It all starts with the elderly patient Gino B., in room 8, near the boiling radiator. He always had a very high fever, from about February 10th. They move him to room 15, a triple room. After Coronavirus bursts in Italy they discover, I believe with a plate or a swab, which is positive. They move him to a single room, the 5. Regarding the two patients who were next to him, one died days ago "".“I don't know how Coronavirus got there in here, but definitely not from hospitalized patients. Here is a Casalpusterlengo nurse who has a mother who is a nurse at the Codogno hospital, a mother who had Coronavirus. The chief of the Sant'Antonino also took Coronavirus in February and apparently his daughter had been at dinner with an intimate friend of the wife of patient 1 of Codogno. The doctor F., the doctor C., the nurse S., the head nurse C., "", the physiotherapist F. and so on, got sick. “The hospital hygiene service called me in mid-March and had a partial employee list. I asked him if S., the Casalpusterlengo employee, was on the list and I was told 'The clinic did not give us this name'. They did not have various names of some sick employees or of the red areas that had to stay at home. ""“We operators of Sant'Antonino are destroyed. We only work for patients. We haven't had an FFP3 mask to do oxygen therapy for weeks, so we will all be infected around that time. We saw panic in here, but no one in the management shared any information with us mortals. At a meeting my colleague N. said she would go to the union, they contested that she was not a serious person. The health problem could have happened, this silence could not ”. “The Covids moved them all here to Sant'Antonino because the operating room is in Casa Piacenza. They could therefore continue to operate and invoice, here we were treated like garbage. Those who had fallen ill with us are now mixed with Covid patients sent from hospitals, so the waters can now be confused. If Luca Baldino from Ausl wants to start investigating, start with the patient Gino B. "". “The problems start from before the emergency. Here we have no soap, gauze, right ointments for dressings. For years, we have been told to recycle the bibs where patients eat. Here everything has always been geared towards savings, with continual management cazziatoni "".A nurse from Sant'Antonino tells me: “From one shift to the next, I found 80 patients with Covid here without knowing how to manage them. 20 people died in one week. A woman from the Ausl gave us a quick lesson on how to use the overalls, telling us: 'You don't even have to look at the patients, they are all people who will die'. The nurse cries as she tells it. “I wash them, I take care of everyone, for me they are all as if they were my mother, if I save one I am happy. But we are too few here, sometimes I find the diapers of the day before. This morning a patient ripped my soul out. He took my hand and asked me: 'How is my wife, please tell me.' The wife was sick, they die alone, like flies. At least let them die with dignity. If I complain that I need personnel, they tell me: if you don't want to work here, that's the door ”. “We have been asking for tampons for weeks, Coronavirus patients who entered in late January and then had symptoms in February got sick. If they had swabbed everyone, they would have closed because they would have been without staff ”. “I see patients dying like fish without water, this is just a place where very old patients come to die, at least a little dignity for them and security for us. The Ausl must monitor the rigor with which the private sector works, what does Piacenza do? Since the relatives have not entered here, what has been done has been done, who has checked? ”.A cleaner, colleague of the dead cleaning lady, tells me: “I work at Casa Piacenza. I am destroyed. It hurts to breathe, my head hurts, I'm so afraid, I have a family. I was working with Monica, so I may have taken Coronavirus too. She had a fever, stopped for a few days, then returned to work with a fever and eventually died at home. A colleague of mine is positive, her husband took it from her too, ended up in hospital. Here they did the swab to whoever seemed to them. "" “In the meantime I had been going on for weeks with a mask that should be used 8 hours and that I used 1 week. I don't want to die, I have a son. My colleagues are all with fever, I saw the primary every day and I didn't know he was sick, I knew he had Coronavirus after a week. Ditto Dr. C. and who knows how many others "".Another nurse reveals: “I don't know how Coronavirus entered here at Sant'Antonino. We took blood cultures without knowing that the virus was running. Then one day I find out that the primary's mother died. That the primary has Coronavirus. Our head nurse is from Codogno. They made tampons only to some, then they told us that the tampons were finished, but I saw them in a locker, they were there. My colleague L. had interstitial pneumonia. All sick. Here they now make us a tac, if you don't have symptoms like fever and cough you also work with pneumonia. We are not employees, we are landfills. "" “A patient who was staying in the 'Sollievo' room for 3.000 euros a month at Casa Piacenza who was not positive and got the virus here died. We are two nurses out of 40 patients, we don't know where to turn. We are slaughter meat, we and the poor sick. We have the resolution to tie the wrists for their sake because we can't look at them all, otherwise the oxygen will rise. We can't do anything, Urbason is also in short supply for therapies, sometimes I take it from the emergency trolley. If we complain we are told that there is a line outside the door to work there, we can leave. Many of us have decided to speak and that's good. The problems here exploded with Covid, but they started with the management of Mario Sanna, before we worked well with Doctor Agamemnon "".Luisa says: “My mother-in-law was hospitalized on 13 March at Sant'Antonino with a fever and cough. My husband had a very high fever, but Ausl did not want to swab. On Saturdays we call and we can't talk to anyone. We call three times but they tell me they don't know the patients well yet. In the evening they put my phone down. On Sundays they say that my mother-in-law responds to treatment and to bring a change. They don't answer us the next day. In the end my brother-in-law goes to the clinic with the change the next day at 13.00. They ask him for the lady's name, a doctor comes after 30 minutes and informs him that my mother-in-law died during the night. Nobody warned us! We never had a diagnosis, nothing. Did they cure her for Covid? It's an obscene thing. ""Silvia Bettini, from Piacenza, had her dad at Sant'Antonino, hospitalized on February 13th. “I last saw him on the 23rd. Days later on the phone they tell me he's breezy. Nobody tells us that Coronavirus runs there, but I find out by the wrong way. So one evening my brother called the clinic threatening them, saying 'I know what's going on in there, take my father immediately to the emergency room in Piacenza!'. After half an hour they call us from the emergency room and tell us that my father had arrived malnourished and dehydrated. He was dying and they would have morphine on him. He died a few hours later, at night. We were told that he definitely had Coronavirus because of very severe interstitial pneumonia. He never had treatment for Coronavirus. ""Andrea, the son of a woman who was admitted to Sant'Antonino, tells me: “My mother had been operated on at the Piacenza hospital in late January and then went to Sant'Antonino for rehabilitation. I was all advised against that clinic. She came in on February 25st and stayed until the 26th. My mother and I fell ill with Coronavirus. I got sick on the 25th. They denied that there were cases of Coronavirus, I got angry because a lady who was in the same room as my mother had carers who constantly changed and came twice a day, when the Codogno case had already erupted. They were all with coughs and colds, they told of sick relatives. I quarreled and went to the nurses to report the situation. On the 26th I asked to discharge her: my mother comes home and stays with the caregiver. On the 29th I get sick. The caregiver on the 118th calls me and tells me that mom is sick, on the XNUMX they go to get her and discover pneumonia. In the end she makes the swab and is positive. I inside the Sant'Antonino I saw a terrible atmosphere of fear and silence, the doctors said to me 'Let's not talk here please, they hear us!'. They left healthy and infected together for a long time, they did not inform us relatives that the same primary and doctors with whom we spoke were infected, we all went around Piacenza sick. They ticked patients in February when they understood what was going on, a doctor confirmed it to me, but they chose not to tell the truth how it should be done and immediately to all involved "".After my first article on Casa Piacenza it came out on The fact on March 18, some of my sources at the facilities told me that the managers of the clinics had an intimidating attitude towards employees, threatening layoffs if they discovered my sources. Regarding the death of the cleaning woman Monica Rossi, Ausl confirmed to her sister Marina the positivity of the swab: “But the general practitioner wrote that my sister Monica died of stroke and - you know what? - Without ever having seen his body after death! When I asked him for explanations he was vague and then he never spoke to me again.

" Coronavirus, the killer drug for the sick","An anti-coronavirus cure initially approved but stopped after 7 days. The medicine can cause respiratory failure. How many people was it given to?For a week, coronavirus patients were given a drug by the Italian national health service (SSN) which proved to be ""incompatible"" with their health and which could also have caused minor damage to the group of patients to whom it was administered.The drug is interferon beta 1, to which a mysterious number of Covid 19 patients had access in that short period. Commercially available on the Italian market, it exists under the name Avonex, used to date in the treatment of plaque sclerosis. As is clear from the instructions, its administration in those treatments had to be done by intramuscular injection or at the limit under the skin. Aifa - the Italian drug agency - has instead authorized its use in the fight against intravenous coronavirus. The result according to the warnings of the drug is a substantial overdose due to faster absorption. And the effects already tested in this case are, among other things: ""fainting. Seizures, depressive disorders, including serious ones with suicidal ideation, arrhythmias, angina, high blood pressure, heart failure and even breathing difficulties "". We do not know what happened to those patients, but it is certain that after 7 days of administration that authorization to use interferon beta 1 was suddenly revoked by Aifa itself. Authorization and revocation are public documents, both published in the Official Journal as a drug agency's determine. The first is dated March 17 and establishes that interferon beta 1 «is payable entirely by the National Health Service as support therapy for patients with Sars-CoV2 infection (COVID-19), in compliance with the conditions indicated for it. in Annex 1 which is an integral part of this determination "". The annex to which it refers explained that the drug was obviously contraindicated for those who had hypersensitivity to interferon beta 1, to those who were following other ""corticosteroid therapy"" and for pregnant or lactating women. It also stipulated that the cure would be borne by the NHS for three months, and the therapeutic plan: ""dosage 10 mg per day as an intravenous bolus for a maximum of 6 consecutive days"". Finally, the parameters indicated for clinical monitoring: ""During the treatment with the medicine, extubation times and mortality must be monitored"".Eight days later - on March 25 - a new Aifa decision was published in the Official Gazette which revoked the previous decision which should have lasted three months, explaining only that the technical and scientific commission of the Medicines Agency at its meeting held on March 24 « has deemed it appropriate to withdraw this insertion due to incompatibility problems of the available formulation with respect to the proposed use "".When I read both official journals I jumped on the chair: «What happened to allow coronavirus patients to use a drug that is withdrawn after only seven days? Has it been used on any patient? With what effects? Have you improved your situation or aggravated it, given the retirement? ». All questions that should be answered in the minutes of that AIFA technical commission, which however is neither published nor public. I tried to get news from inside the Agency as I had already done in the past, but I found a reserve that had never been placed before me. Insisting the only thing I knew was that the drug had already been tested before its authorization on about 300 patients, with some success. And with this I was clear the reason for the first Aifa resolution, which included it among the official coronavirus treatments paid by the public health system. But why then was it withdrawn? A thriller.So I sent the two official journals to the Deputy Minister of Health, Pier Paolo Sileri, who jumped on the chair as soon as I read it exactly as it had happened to me: ""I am informed"". Sileri is always very kind and cares about transparency, but in this case he had an extra sensitivity: in the tunnel of that bad disease he too passed firsthand, and has just come out. The deputy minister tried through the short and informal ways to have clarifications from AIFA, in the hope of being able to provide a quick and reassuring response. But the attempt failed. So he asked for official clarifications by sending a letter to AIFA in his role as controlling minister. At that point they could not remain silent. There he asked the reasons for the authorization and those of the revocation as well as the number of Covid 19 patients possibly treated in that week of authorization of the drug and with what result. He received the official answer 36 hours after his questions, only late yesterday evening. And he turned it around. Here it is: «As for any patients treated with IFN-beta1a from 17 to 25 March, this data is not yet available to AIFA, since the platform for the insertion of data by clinicians is being published these days. Furthermore, in this moment of emergency, hospital centers are not easy to send data and therefore we will verify them as soon as possible. The reference study for initial insertion involved intravenous treatment. Unfortunately, the formulations available in Italy are not authorized for intravenous use and therefore the CTS, as part of the continuous reassessment of the evidence relating to drugs for the treatment of COVID-19, deemed it appropriate to revoke the inclusion in the lists to pursuant to law 648/96, for the mentioned problems of incompatibility of the available formulation with respect to the proposed use ».Unfortunately, the answer clarifies little. Confirm what we had discovered for ourselves: authorization had been given to use an intravenous drug which, however, exists on the market only for intramuscular administration. And this is already a sensational mistake: because being the AIFA the agency that authorizes the marketing of drugs in Italy, it is the only subject that should know its characteristics. But it is the first part of the answer that worries a lot. The agency could have replied: ""Obviously the drug not available for what we thought was not administered even to a patient."" Unfortunately it does not say this, quite the contrary. He simply says that he is unable to know at this moment, having to wait for the data that will gradually arrive from the Italian hospitals. The only thing is to hope that this incredible injury of the agency has not led to a similar error in any hospital or doctor who trusted AIFA following the instructions provided. God forbid that our health system administered to the sick of this ugly beast what it could cause even without the virus a respiratory failure.Source: https://www.iltempo.it/cronache/2020/04/01/news/coronavirus-ai-malati-farmaco-killer-aifa-autorizza-poi-ritira-avonex-interferone-beta-1-contro-covid-19-insufficienza-respiratoria-1306393/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
" Presumed SARS and influenza virus samples found in baggage: FBI report describes China's ""biosecurity risk""","WASHINGTON - In late November 2018, just over a year before the first coronavirus case was identified in Wuhan, U.S. customs and border protection agents at Detroit Metro airport stopped a Chinese biologist with three ampoules labeled ""Antibodies. "".The biologist told the agents that a colleague in China had asked him to deliver the vials to a researcher from a U.S. institution. After examining the vials, however, the customs agents came to an alarming conclusion.""The inspection of the writing on the vials and the declared recipient led the inspection staff to believe that the materials contained in the vials could be materials of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome)""The report, written by the FBI's Directorate of Weapons of Mass Destruction Chemical and Biological Intelligence Unit (WMDD), does not provide the name of the Chinese scientist carrying the suspected SARS and MERS samples, or the intended recipient in the United States. , but the FBI concluded that the incident and two other cases mentioned in the report were part of an alarming pattern.""The Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate assesses foreign scientific researchers who carry undeclared and undocumented biological materials in the United States in their cabin baggage and / or checked baggage almost certainly pose a risk to biosafety in the United States."", reads the report. ""The WMDD carries out this evaluation with great confidence based on direct access link relationships.""The report, published more than two months before the World Health Organization learned of a group of pneumonia cases in Wuhan that turned out to be COVID-19, appears to be part of a larger FBI concern about involvement. of China in scientific research in the United States. Although the report refers extensively to foreign researchers, all three cases cited concern Chinese citizens.In the case of the suspected SARS and MERS vials, the intelligence report cites another classified document which is marked as ""FISA"" in the sense that it contains information collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Another case mentioned in the report appeared to involve strains of influenza and one third were suspected of E. coli.The FBI does not say exactly what type of biosecurity risk these cases could present, but Raina MacIntyre, a professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, said the FBI appears to be concerned with dual-use research. which would be used for bioterrorism. And if the illicit samples mentioned in the report were brought to the United States, he says, the traffic will likely be both ways.General Robert Spalding, who worked on China-related issues in the National Security Council under the Trump administration, said that ""there is a threat"" posed by Chinese citizens carrying biological samples, said that: ""likely the courier ... would be someone who was not aware,"" making it difficult to determine the intent. ""Some may probably be intentional, to test our ability to identify and intercept. Others may be opportunists.""The FBI report refers to both biosafety, and in gender refers to the intentional use of pathogens, as for bioterrorism, both to biosecurity, which covers accidental release. The FBI declined to comment on the report.Concerns about Chinese biosecurity are not new. For example, the SARS epidemic in 2003 was followed by numerous episodes of infections caused by laboratory accidents, including eight cases resulting from mismanagement at the Chinese Institute of Virology in Beijing.""There have been cases in the past where a variant of a flu pandemic species had escaped a laboratory due to mismanagement,"" said Elsa Kania, an adjunct member of the Center for a New American Security.But the problem isn't limited to Chinese researchers, although those cases have been important, he continued. ""It certainly is a risk for biosecurity when someone transports materials clandestine because ... there have been several incidents in which this has occurred with researchers of various nationalities.""Concerns about China's non-compliance with biosafety precautions have a long history, but the coronavirus pandemic is likely to exacerbate tensions between Beijing and Washington. The epidemic comes as the growing tensions in US-China relations on issues ranging from trade to espionage.Andrew Weber, who worked during the Obama administration as assistant secretary of defense for nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs, said that the relationship with China in the life sciences has deteriorated in recent years.“After SARS, when China needed technical assistance, it had a strong relationship with the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. They were transparent, because they realized that covering an epidemic cost him dearly, ""said Weber, now senior member of the Council on Strategic Risks."" In recent years they have strengthened, making international cooperation more difficult. ""In recent weeks, however, these tensions have rapidly increased, with President Trump calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"", while Beijing has in turn promoted conspiracy theories by stating that the virus originated in a weapons laboratory of United States.Scientists have been firmly convinced that the virus is not a weapon, neither from the United States nor from China. ""There is no basis for suspecting that it is a laboratory construct,"" says Richard Ebright, professor of chemical biology at Rutgers University. ""It has none of the expected signatures that would be present for deliberate construction.""However, Ebright does not rule out the possibility that the spread of the virus started with poor biosecurity in China. A fundamental theory is that the virus has gone from wildlife to humans. Some researchers speculate that this happened in an animal market where exotic species are being sold as food. But Ebright also notes that these wildlife viruses are collected in laboratories, including in Wuhan. ""Therefore, it is also possible that this virus entered the human population through an accidental infection by a laboratory worker who collects it in the field or an accident by a laboratory worker who characterizes the sample in a laboratory.""Regardless of the coronavirus, the FBI's focus on Chinese biosecurity appears to be part of the long-standing suspicion by the United States government regarding China's involvement in the biological sciences. Numerous recent high-profile cases from the Justice Department involving the export of sensitive technologies have involved Chinese scientists or people with alleged ties to the Chinese government.Above all, the Justice Department in January announced accusations against Charles Lieber, president of the Harvard department of chemistry and chemical biology, for hiding ties to the Chinese government. ""It's a clear case of conflict of interest and, unfortunately, it's not an isolated incident,"" said FBI Special Agent Joseph R. Bonavolonta, head of the Boston field office, in announcing the allegations. .But the FBI's focus on China and the Chinese aspects are also raising concerns among some academics. ""I'm afraid he says the trend of national security is to profile people of Chinese descent,"" said Nicholas Evans, assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, who specializes in medical ethics. ""It's not just racist, it's bad practice. The FBI and other attempts at profiling intelligence and law enforcement have often been harmful without making us safer.""Evans also questioned the FBI's focus on topics that carried biological samples as a single threat. He pointed to earlier examples, such as an American laboratory in Maine that was fined more than a decade ago for importing bird flu and highly pathogenic viruses from Saudi Arabia.""The FBI says it is impossible to accurately determine the contents of the samples, even if declared under the applicable import laws"" ... ""That's true. But I'm skeptical about the degree to which this particular behavior adds risks associated with the given security. that there are many other ways to bring biological agents into the country. ""Yanzhong Huang, a senior member of the Council on Foreign Relations, said that it has been true that China has long had gaps in its biosecurity regulations. ""That's why [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] spoke in February about strengthening biosecurity and biosecurity legislation.""That story has already encouraged rumors such as the idea that coronavirus originated as a biological weapon.Now, as relations between China and the United States deteriorate, Huang predicts that collaboration in biological research will become even more difficult, reversing decades of cooperation. ""I often argue that the United States' commitment to China is the most successful in the public health field."" This cooperation also survived the difficult period after the 1989 Tiananmen Square protest.Now, however, these relations are being reduced to the object of hostilities between the two countries.Source: https://news.yahoo.com/suspected-sars-virus-and-flu-found-in-luggage-fbi-report-describes-chinas-biosecurity-risk-144526820.html",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0

" Paolo Liguori: Chinese syndrome, the virus originates in a Wuhan military laboratory","An alarming news is reported in a national news network: the virus that is causing the current deaths in China may have escaped from a military laboratory located in Wuhan. It is not the only source, both in the USA and in Russia the same news begins to predominate.The Wuhan laboratory had already been mentioned in 2017 (1) in prestigious scientific journals and had raised the concern of many scientists about the safety issue. In that laboratory we played with genetic editing of very dangerous viruses, such as Sars.Now, however, we are reminded that in the same period the prestigious World Health Organization had prophesied the advent of a ""Disease X"", a completely theoretical pandemic disease but one of the diseases that would have threatened humanity. Was this theoretical X pandemic the result of mere speculation? Is the fact that the release of a modified pathogen (they specified genetic editing) among the triggers was completely random with what is happening now in China?The questions remain unanswered for now, of course there is only a huge round of money, a speculation on health enhanced by a media-induced psychosis but we want to emphasize one point: if the news were to be confirmed, with all the ""SEs"" derived from a state, the Chinese one, which would do everything to avoid confirmation, we would face a paradox, who should defend us from pandemics or invent them (3) or cause them ...PS As always, the Italian government is very quick to shed light on what is happening, it is never that someone thinks that the delicate relations between Italy and China for the 5G technology issue, can somehow make us too soft in the real assessment of the situation ... in the end we have #TheExperts ...",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 Coronavirus: almost 3 months ago the ministry was already alerted,"We had promised ourselves not to talk about the current Covid19 situation except for two distinct aspects but united by a single and indissoluble question: if someone is jointly responsible for the problem, how can it also be solved?The first aspect that will lead us to talk about Covid19, but we will deal with it soon, focuses on where the virus is born. For us it is an absolutely primary question: the answer, as a logical consequence, helps to understand who has had any responsibility, with or without malice, for the propagation of the pathogen. Because let's face it: if it were incidental and if it was the Wuhan laboratory, our beloved WHO would have to give more than one explanation to the whole world.The second aspect that almost obliges us today to talk about Covid19 is the reaction of the institutions, both Italian and worldwide.And here we are. Yesterday, March 27, 2020, we read on Il Fatto Quotidiano that there is a document from the Ministry of Health dated January 5, 2020 which reported the following note: ""... clinical signs and symptoms mainly consist of fever, breathing difficulties, while chest radiographs show invasive lesions in both lungs ... the occurrence of 44 cases of pneumonia that need hospitalization and form a cluster must be considered with caution "". Of this note, as reported in the article, public opinion was not informed, nor were doctors; subsequent clusters of viral pneumonia that occurred in Italy were therefore not treated with due caution, according to this information.But there is more, alone after February 21st (when Italy had its patient 1), a series of institutional meetings and meetings began and, as Professor Antonio Pesenti, director of resuscitation at the Polyclinic of Milan, declares: the risk was underestimated. He explains of ""simulations on the development of the contagion"" which confirmed that ""it was immediately clear that the intensive care would go to pain"" ... for us this is a fact of enormous gravity, second only to not having warned and monitored January any clusters.What Il Fatto Quotidiano does not write is that the respirators for intensive care have been ordered by Consip tender only from 10 March 2020 and that still today there is a hard clash between regions and the Government precisely on finding both respirators for intensive and sub-intensive therapies, and all the material suitable for health personnel.We recommend staying at home and drawing lots of colorful rainbows, but if you have some time left it would be desirable to realize that something has not worked and a whole series of constitutional rights have been waived for the protection of public health, the protection that, from what can be deduced from the article of Il Fatto, it has not been implemented from the beginning. Understanding today whether the pandemic - or at least the state of emergency of health currently taking place in our country - was made such due to someone's carelessness and / or incapacity, can lead us to formulate two further questions:Source: https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/in-edicola/articoli/2020/03/27/coronavirus-quasi-3-mesi-fa-il-ministero-era-gia-allertato/5750662/",1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
 # Covid19 - Stunning coincidences,#Covid19 - The mysteries of the Coronavirus Pandemic: Biological weapon? An instrument for abolishing democracy? Planetary financial reset? by Roberto Quaglia EN SUB,1,https://www.corvelva.it,0
MSN: Why Covid Herd Immunity Could Be ‘Twice as High as First Thought’,"Two new scientific studies suggesting that immunity to COVID-19 may be much higher than previously thought offer some much-needed hope in the battle against the disease.Although coronavirus antibody testing has found that levels are low even in the cities worst hit by the pandemic, other types of immune response appear to be more widespread. Indeed, the Telegraph says:“public immunity could be as much as twice that found in antibody tests, meaning infection hotspots such as London could be further along the path to herd immunity than thought.“1Is there a natural ceiling? Scientists have been perplexed by the tendency of the new coronavirus to spread quickly and then slow down long before expecting to see herd immunity. Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeSweden-based epidemiology professors Paul W. Franks of Lund University and Joacim Rocklov of Umea University, in an article on The Conversation say:“On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, for example, where the virus is likely to have spread relatively freely through the air-conditioning system linking cabins, only 20% of passengers and crew were infected.”1They noted that the 20% ceiling on infections has also been seen in outbreaks on military ships, as well as in London, Stockholm, and New York. MSN reports:“This has led to speculation about whether a population can achieve some sort of immunity to the virus with as little as 20% infected” – much lower than the “widely accepted herd immunity threshold” of 60% to 70% suggested by earlier mathematical models.1T-cells could explain the discrepancy. Recent studies have focused on T cells’ role, a type of white blood cell that forms part of the human immune system. T cells “thwart infections in two different ways”, says Science magazine:…by spurring other cells to produce antibodies and by targeting and destroying infected cells. The severity of disease can depend on the strength of these T cell responses.1And unlike antibodies, which are specific to a particular virus or bacteria, T cells activated by one infection can protect against an array of similar threats. Microsoft News noted:As such, people with activated T cells that are effective against the Covid-19 coronavirus could help to close the gap between the 20% of people with antibodies and the 60% or more needed for herd immunity.1U of O Scientist Seeking Edible Vaccine for COVID-19 Hopes to Put Them in Veggies that People Would EatIn fact, according to MSN, ‘a third of us may be immune.’1 A new study conducted by the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden looked at blood samples from 200 adults, including people with no symptoms of Covid-19. The Telegraph reports:“In total, 30% of the healthy blood donors were found to have developed ‘T-cell immunity’ – twice the number of cases in which antibodies were detected.”1It is unclear whether active T cells – or indeed antibodies – offer complete protection against the coronavirus. Still, scientists say that both responses are likely to help the body fight the virus. Study co-author Marcus Buggert, an assistant professor at the institute’s Centre for Infectious Medicine, said:“What this means is that we are probably underestimating the number of people that have some type of immunity.”1Another study involving T cells by researchers at Germany’s University Hospital Tubingen found even more widespread immunity among a total of 365 volunteers. As had been expected, when their blood was exposed to the new coronavirus, the 180 participants who had previously had Covid-19 showed the strongest T-cell immune response. The Daily Mail reports:“But surprisingly, there was also an immune reaction in 81% of the people (150) who had never had Covid-19. This, the scientists said, was because they had already been infected with one or more of the common cold coronaviruses known to infect humans.”1Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19About a third of all colds are thought to be caused by coronaviruses that predate the new variant which causes Covid-19.If T cells are a critical part of the body’s defenses against Covid-19, low levels of these “immune hunters” in older people might explain why the elderly are more likely to die from the virus. Disease experts Franks and Rocklov added:“Young people and those with mild infections are more likely to have a T-cell response than old people. We know that the reservoir of programmable T-cells declines with age.“1And if T cells are most effective against the new coronavirus when they have already fought off a similar infection, this may have helped some countries like Japan contain the pandemic more easily than others. The Observer noted:“Exposure to the related virus that caused the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) in 2002-04 might have afforded some protection to East Asians against Covid-19.”1",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a Decade,"Just as COVID-19 (reportedly caused by the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2) has dominated the news cycle in 2020, so, too, the focus on an eventual coronavirus vaccine has crowded out needed attention to a wider range of prevention and treatment strategies. Self-appointed pandemic guru Bill Gates—through a complex tangle of direct and indirect funding mechanisms that includes being the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) second largest donor—is gleefully leading the contingent promoting planet-wide coronavirus vaccination, unashamedly asserting that a vaccine “is the only thing that will allow us to return to normal.” Gates has the effrontery to make such claims despite financial conflicts of interest blatant enough to be noticed even by the credulous, and a lengthy trail of vaccine-related destruction left in the wake of Gates-funded vaccine programs around the world.Globally, roughly 70 COVID-19 vaccines are in various stages of development—a veritable gold rush that will be all the more lucrative since Gates has made sure that the vaccines will be indemnified against lawsuits. Gates funding, through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), is helping to spur the accelerated development of some of the leading contenders, including two of the three experimental vaccines rushed into Phase I trials in humans without any preliminary testing in animal models. (A third experimental vaccine will soon proceed to Phase II trials in China.) The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is running the trial of one of these vaccines (mRNA-1273), co-developed under CEPI sponsorship with Cambridge-based biotech firm Moderna. Meanwhile, Pennsylvania-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals is conducting a Phase I trial of INO-4800, a vaccine being developed with massive infusions of funding from both the Gates Foundation and CEPI.In early April, Dr. Jerome H. Kim (Director General of the United-Nations-affiliated International Vaccine Institute) called attention to the “unprecedented speed” with which the Phase I trials launched, stating that it will be difficult to know whether a vaccine developed in a scant four, 12 or even 18 months “is really safe” and noting that the vaccine development process ordinarily takes anywhere from five to ten years. Although striving for enthusiasm about the “remarkable” speed-up, Kim warned that even when vaccine makers appropriately begin the process with animal studies, “vaccine development is characterized by a high failure rate of ‘often 93%.’”Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsDr. Kim’s words of warning are far from theoretical. In the mid-to-late 2000s, scientists engaged in an ultimately futile effort to develop a vaccine to address the first SARS-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Researchers of the day developed four SARS-CoV vaccines that underwent testing in animal models and two (described in 2007 and 2008) that proceeded to Phase I trials in humans. The less-than-reassuring results of the animal studies, in particular, prompted one set of researchers to conclude that “Caution in proceeding to application of a SARS-CoV vaccine in humans is indicated” [emphasis added].In 2012, Texas researchers with combined expertise in molecular virology, microbiology, immunology, biodefense and emerging diseases reported in the journal PLoS ONE on their evaluation—in mice—of four candidate vaccines designed to prevent SARS-CoV. All four vaccines had run into trouble in earlier experimental studies, which showed that the vaccines had a tendency to induce pathologic lung reactions in the unfortunate recipients—whether mice, ferrets or nonhuman primates.The Texas scientists reevaluated the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of two whole-virus vaccines prepared in Vero tissue or Vero cell cultures (from African green monkey kidney); one recombinant (genetically engineered) DNA spike protein vaccine produced in insect cells; and their own virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine containing SARS-CoV proteins as well as mouse hepatitis coronavirus. They also compared versions of the vaccines containing an aluminum adjuvant with adjuvant-free formulations. The research team injected the experimental groups of mice with vaccine on days zero and 28, exposed them to live SARS-CoV on day 56 and sacrificed them two days later (day 58) to examine the lungs for virus and histopathology, comparing the experimental mice to control groups.All four vaccines appeared to induce antibodies against SARS-CoV two days after exposure to live virus. However, the second set of results—the findings that persuaded the researchers to urge the utmost caution in proceeding to human testing—showed that all of the vaccinated mice, irrespective of the type of vaccine or the presence or absence of aluminum adjuvant, displayed unique lung damage not seen in the control mice, and the pathology occurred in the absence of any detectable SARS coronavirus in the lungs. The researchers described this “Th2-type immunopathology”—indicated in part by abnormal levels of white blood cells called eosinophils—as suggestive of vaccine-induced “hypersensitivity to SARS-CoV components.”To explain their findings, the Texas researchers pointed to studies showing similar immunopathologic reactions in human infants who, in the 1960s, received vaccines for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). That body of research found that the RSV vaccine “stimulated an unbalanced immune response” that “potentiated” disease in the vaccine recipients upon subsequent exposure to RSV, often leading to hospitalization and sometimes leading to death. Given that the very basis for developing a SARS vaccine was to protect vaccine recipients from infectious SARS-CoV, the Texas researchers concluded that a vaccine that instead elicited an immunopathologic reaction (as had occurred in the 1960s with the RSV vaccine) was cause for concern.More recently, in 2016, scientists expressed similar worries when children in the Philippines developed serious complications or died after receiving a vaccine to protect against dengue disease. Far from protecting the children, the vaccine dramatically worsened risks of severe complications in children exposed to dengue after vaccination. The deaths of roughly 600 children are now under criminal investigation.DailyBeast: Bill Gates Praised Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s Lifestyle: ‘Kind of Intriguing’Two other worries highlighted by the Texas researchers in 2012 are worth mentioning in light of today’s COVID-19 context. First, given that there are a number of human coronaviruses, the researchers suggested that their results raised important questions about the “safety of vaccinated persons exposed to other coronaviruses.” Second, they noted that although the two Phase I clinical trials of SARS-CoV vaccines in humans had reported the vaccines to “induce antibody responses and to be ‘safe,’ . . . the evidence for safety [was] for a short period of observation.” Today, knowing that even the WHO’s top experts are questioning how vaccine safety gets evaluated, one wonders how the rushed COVID-19 vaccine trials will be able to address SARS-CoV safety concerns to any meaningful degree.Bill Gates and his foundation have longstanding ties with the good-cop/bad-cop duo that has been headlining the official COVID-19 narrative: Dr. Anthony Fauci, long-time NIAID director, and physician and retired Army colonel Dr. Deborah Birx, U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and Special Representative for Global Health Diplomacy. It is noteworthy that the two government doctors are long-time allies, having cut their professional teeth working “side by side” on the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and sharing overlapping career paths ever since. With HIV vaccine patents to both their names, neither Birx nor Fauci is a stranger to the lure and potential profits involved in vaccine development—regardless of whether the vaccine ever pans out.In the early 2000s, Birx was one of the lead investigators of an HIV vaccine clinical trial in Thailand. Although the trial’s methodology and results drew severe criticism, Birx and others—including Fauci—spun the study as a success. As her reward, Birx then spent the next ten years directing the CDC’s Division of Global HIV/AIDS. In 2016, Fauci and NIAID dished out more taxpayer money to test the same HIV vaccine all over again in South Africa, but NIAID had to call a halt to the study in February 2020, when an interim review found that the vaccine was worthless.Around the same time as the Thai vaccine trial, Fauci was active as one of the “principal architects” of the 2003 President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), a still-ongoing program that has since ballooned into over 50 countries, where it coordinates (across seven different U.S. departments and agencies) promotion of HIV drugs and other measures. Since 2014, PEPFAR has been led by none other than Birx, who has been only too happy to accept generous Gates Foundation support. The foundation is the top source of philanthropic funding for all international HIV efforts, and development of an HIV vaccine remains one of its core “areas of focus.” In the face of recent Trump administration threats to slash PEPFAR’s budget, Birx has declared her willingness to seek out “other sources of funding wherever she can find them.”The National Institutes of Health (NIH), of which NIAID is a part, have been joined at the hip with the Gates Foundation for many years, together funding 57% of “global-health research and development on diseases that disproportionately affect populations in low- and middle-income countries.” The close partnership has involved working to develop new vaccines (such as a malaria vaccine and a universal influenza vaccine) as well as mobilizing Gates funding streams to roll out NIH-developed vaccines across the developing world. In 2013, Gates declared himself “thrilled” with NIH for “pushing [vaccine research] forward” and stated, “We are just at the beginning of what we can do together.”Despite writing on March 26 in The New England Journal of Medicine that the COVID-19 case fatality rate is likely to be no worse than the rate observed for a severe seasonal flu, Dr. Fauci continues to pledge allegiance to extreme measures, parroting Mr. Gates’ statements that more prolonged lockdowns are necessary and advising Americans to become a nation of obsessive-compulsive hand-washers who never share a handshake again. On these topics , Birx has been evasive and non-committal.Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exposes Bill Gates & his relationship with Big PharmaRecently, Dr. Zeke Emanuel—coronavirus advisor to both Joe Biden and the WHO, and one of the former ringleaders behind Obamacare—joined the fray, urging the banning of conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services and restaurant meals for another 18 months, or “until we have a vaccine that protects everyone.” The Guardian obligingly echoed this vaccine-centric propaganda on April 8 when, reporting on a Chinese study just published in The Lancet, the British rag stated that “Lockdowns can’t end until Covid-19 vaccine found.”Listening to these individuals’ carefully crafted public briefings on COVID-19 exit strategies, one could easily get the impression that a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine is, indeed, the only way out. For a population amped up on hysteria and fear, it may be challenging to accept other solutions—including the historically documented benefits of natural herd immunity—but the studies on unsafe vaccines for SARS-CoV, RSV and dengue suggest that Americans would be wise to ask the age-old question of “who benefits” and push back against the billionaires and scientists looking to limit choices, control populations and make a financial killing.*Article originally appeared at the Children’s Health Defense.

U of O Scientist Seeking Edible Vaccine for COVID-19 Hopes to Put Them in Veggies that People Would Eat,"University of Ottawa professor and plant biologist Allyson MacLean hopes that eating your veggies will one day soon protect you against COVID-19.McClean has been busy during the pandemic designing an edible vaccine for the virus. Her research involves injecting tomato, potato, and lettuce plants with a tiny particle of viral DNA swimming in a bacterial solution. McClean, an assistant professor of plant biology, said:“We take a syringe that does not have a needle point. You press it up against the large leaf … and you basically push … the bacteria into the plant tissues.” The bacteria carry that DNA into the plant, which triggers the production of viral proteins. Consuming the plant enables these proteins to pass through the digestive system, where they’re taken up by specialized cells in the gut, stimulating a type of immunity called “mucosal immunity.” It’s of particular interest to the scientists in battle with COVID-19 because the virus that causes the disease (SARS-CoV-2) enters the body via the respiratory system’s mucosal surface. Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeIn her current research to create an edible vaccine for COVID-19, MacLean uses “parts of the virus that other researchers believe will elicit a strong protective antibody response.” They’re hitching a ride into the plant tissue on the back of her old friend Agrobacterium.Ibuprofen And COVID-19 Symptoms: Here’s What You Need to KnowMacLean has spent a decade studying symbiosis in nature, specifically how microbes and plants co-exist. One of the most common microbes is Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which lives in soil and naturally latches onto plants. She explained:“It finds a wound in the plant and it gets in there. It takes part of its DNA and injects it into a plant cell. It basically makes the plant cells grow tumours … that the bacteria can then use as a food source.” “People realized a few decades ago that this was going on in nature,” she said. “Somebody had the brilliant idea: OK, can we harness this as a way of making genetically modified organisms?”MacLean is currently using a close relative of tobacco to determine the best way to make a plant express the viral proteins. Next stop, lettuce. Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19The pandemic has challenged MacLean’s research. When COVID-19 struck in March, she struggled to move her hands-on laboratory course online. She was especially worried about her “precious transgenic mutant plants” left behind in the lab when the U of O campus closed down due to COVID-19. To continue caring for them, she was granted permission to feed and fertilize the plants three times a week. MacLean thinks injecting plants with vaccines is a more efficient route to global immunity. She also believes that more people would rather eat their medicine that get a shot, adding:“Plant-based vaccines are better for the developing world. They’re cheaper to produce. They don’t need … to be refrigerated for long periods of time.”“People are more willing to ingest a vaccine than they are to get a needle.” In collaboration with John Bell of the Ottawa Health Research Institute, MacLean’s work will be tested on mice. She said:“This project is pairing up a cancer researcher who uses viruses to tackle cancer and a plant biologist who normally studies the way microorganisms interact with plants. We’re both stretching out of our comfort zones.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
FOX: Doctor Claiming Covid-19 Conspiracy Tells Reporter “We Don’t Have Much Time”,"A highly respected Chinese virologist has fled Hong Kong and says that the Chinese government knew about COVID-19 long before they claim they did.In an exclusive interview, Yan Li-Meng told Bill Hemmer Reports that lives could have been saved if the Chinese government hadn’t censored her work, adding:“This is a huge pandemic we have seen in the world. It’s more than anything we’ve known in human history. So, the timing is very, very important. If we can stop it early, we can save lives.”Yan said she believes the Chinese government knew about the novel coronavirus well before publicly acknowledging the outbreak. She also claimed her supervisors, renowned as some of the top experts in the field, ignored research she was doing at the onset of the pandemic that she believes could have saved lives. She told Fox Digital News:“I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of COVID-19 and the origin of the SARS-2 COVID virus.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeShe added that the Beijing government knew in December that more than 40 citizens had already been infected with the virus, and “human-to-human transmissions [were] already [occurring] at that time.” According to Fox:An intelligence dossier compiled by the Five Eyes intelligence agencies that was leaked to an Australian newspaper in May stated that Chinese authorities denied that the virus could be spread between humans until Jan. 20, “despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December.” As late as Jan. 14, the World Health Organization had stated that there was “no clear evidence” for human-to-human transmission of COVID-19.CBS: Researcher Killed In Apparent Murder-Suicide Was Close To ‘Making Very Significant Findings’ Related To COVID-19Yan told Hemmer that she has records of communications with others in China, appearing to describe them as chatlogs, and emphasized that she is very much in fear for her life. She said:“I know how they treat whistleblowers. [They want] To keep people silent if they want to reveal the truth, not only about COVID-19, but also for the other things happening in China.”During the SARS [pandemic of 2003], for example, senior doctor Professor Jiang Yanyong had revealed evidence [of a cover-up] in Beijing … and also in Shanghai [another physician’s] team reviewed the sequence of the SARS-COVID-2 [coronavirus] for the first time in the world and published it in February this year. Then their lab was shut down by the government. Yan added:“I am waiting to tell all the things I know, provide all the evidence to the U.S. Government. And I want them to understand, and I also want the U.S. people to understand how terrible this is. It is not what you have seen … This is something very different. We have to chase the true evidence and get the real evidence because this is a key part to stop this pandemic. We don’t have much time.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
We Just Interviewed Dr. Shi*va. Watch It Here Now.,"Both of us will be interviewing Bobby Kennedy in the next few weeks as well. While I introduced them virtually (and have had the honor to meet Mr Kennedy and call him a friend) I’m thrilled each of us will do a separate interview with Mr Kennedy who is one of my heroes.Today, we continue to provide you information about the COVID-19 pandemic. At the time of this recording, April 6, 2020, there are more than 1.4 million cases worldwide and 370,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., with New York City being one of the hotspots.1,2 Here, I interview Shiva Ayyadurai, who has a Ph.D. in systems biology from MIT.His academic background gives Ayyadurai a slightly different perspective on this outbreak, as it focuses on the foundational causes of disease rather than the conventional medical paradigm that tends to focus on pharmaceutical remedies. Ayyadurai explains:“The MIT department of biological engineering was created in 2003. The notion was … that you needed an engineering approach to biology as new advances or new discoveries were coming out in biology. That created the department of biological engineering …One of the big things that took place in 2003 that led to the formation of that department was, in an ironic way, what occurred with the human genome project starting in 1993. We went into the genome project with a reductionist view of biology. Biologists essentially thought that the number of parts meant complexity. We knew in 1993, a worm had around 20,000 genes. So, we said, OK, we’re going to start mapping out the human genome. We were at least 25 times more complex. The notion was we had about a half a million genes. By 2003, they only found 20,000 protein coding genes. That flipped biology on its head because it said, wait a minute, we have the same number of parts, and they thought genes were a reflection of complexity. That led to systems biology starting around 2003, which said, look, genes create proteins and these proteins interact. So, it’s about all these interactions … Today, that has led to this field called epigenetics, in which we know that the external environment, what we interact with, can turn on and turn off genes. I came back to MIT in 2003. I did four degrees at MIT in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering. My Master’s was in design, but I always was fascinated with medicine.” Flu Misinformation and Coronavirus Fears: My Letter to Dr. Sanjay GuptaThe project Ayyadurai took on for his Ph.D. thesis was to mathematically model the whole human cell. His work led to the creation of a platform called CytoSolve “cyto” standing for “cell.” This approach is different from biology, computer science and chemistry.“Biologists are essentially distributed knowledge engineers,” he says, “and the thing they’re trying to understand is this thing called the body. No different than aeronautical engineers trying to build the airplane. The difference is when we build an airplane, we actually know what we want to build. And we know the parts in biology, we’re finding the parts, that’s what they’re doing. Some biologists can win a Nobel prize just for looking at how two proteins interact. So, they’re very focused on understanding these parts. So, imagine if we could create a technology where we could take those parts, integrate them, and then essentially let them be sort of focused in their silos. But there wouldn’t be this framework that you could integrate, where you could integrate these molecular pathways. And that really created cytosol. To me, it was a big circling back because I grew up in India where my grandmother practiced traditional systems of medicine. In that system of medicine, they had diagnosis methods, they looked at you, they figured out your body type and they would figure out the right types of foods and medicines, herbs or even body work to get you back into balance. That was always seen as a ‘black art’ from a Western medicine [perspective]. [CytoSolve] lets us decipher what they were doing and actually understand these synergies. So that’s what systems biology is about. It’s taking an engineering systems approach to the body … It’s literally understanding how to diagnose and assess and identify what the problem is, and then how to administer a prescription within a few minutes. It’s essentially an ‘AI’-type model. As noted by Ayyadurai, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only highlighting our immune health but also our economic health. We’re seeing the integration of medical policy and economic policy.“I had a very interesting discussion with a leading economist,” Ayyadurai says, “and he had a serious concern about the fact that economists are being forced to backfill in a misguided health policy, which is occurring. What he meant by that is, [they’re being told to] just use quantitative easing, which is basically printing money, and that will solve the problem. Now that entire process does two things. First of all, we have I think 10 million unemployment claims in March alone. In addition to that, you have the fact that we’re going to print money, which … if you look, since 2008 and 2009, when quantitative easing started … that has essentially been the biggest transfer of wealth — to the 0.01%, again. It is essentially a weakened earning power and the [weakened value] of the dollar. So that’s what’s occurred. Now we have this COVID-19, and we have this economic overreaction, in my opinion, from the fear-mongering. In many ways, it reflects the immune system.The immune system fundamentally wants to operate well for you and maintain homeostasis, and it’s the overreaction of a weakened and dysfunctional immune system that causes harm. Similarly, when you look at it from the economic standpoint, we have this unbridled overreaction, in my view. [We’re] not looking at what modern medicine is saying — that we should take a personalized medicine approach, right? One size doesn’t fit all. This is basically flatten the curve: Kick the can down the street. We’re just going to wait until, when? Until the vaccine is produced or until a drug comes out. The assumption is that the immune system of all of us is equally weak. That’s what this is based on. The assumption is that all of us are going to get it and all of us will suffer from it. It’s a very interesting model. Look at the person leading this health policy, Dr. Fauci. His background is from the pharmaceutical world … [and] when you look at the NIH and the CDC, these organizations are heavily, heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies.In that environment, the model has always been never to discuss immune health, what we can do to support the immune system. It’s always under the assumption that there’s this big boogeyman, that the virus harms your body. Most medical doctors, again, they’re victims of this education. Many of them are taught the virus literally comes and attacks your body, and that a vaccine or a pharmaceutical intervention blocks it. It’s not taught broadly that [the problem is that] the dysfunctional, weakened immune system is not running on all cylinders. One part of it can overreact, and that overreaction is what goes in and attacks your own tissues. So, the issue is, we’re not having a discussion at all in the media about ‘How do you modulate that overreaction and support people’s immune health?’”Similarly, Ayyadurai notes, the economic collapse is “a result of precisely engineered governmental policies,” even though those policies, superficially, appear to be in the public’s best interest.COVID-19 meets the technical definition of a pandemic, and the World Health Organization did declare it a pandemic. However, the death toll is nowhere near that of earlier serious pandemics that would legitimately justify the extraordinary measures being deployed by the U.S. government.The Spanish flu in 1918 infected 500 million people worldwide, killing between 20 million and 50 million. The bubonic plague also killed 50 million people, wiping out a shocking 60% of the European population. This is typically what people think of when they hear the word “pandemic.”COVID-19 presently affects a tiny fraction of the global population — about 1.4 million cases out of a global population of 7.78 billion3 — and even with a death toll of 81,000 worldwide,4 COVID-19 has had a miniscule impact, having killed a mere 0.00001% of the population.Don’t get me wrong. Any death is tragic. But any given individual’s risk of dying from the epidemics of diabetes, heart disease or cancer, for example, is greater than their risk of dying from COVID-19. Why is death from lifestyle-induced disease and environmental toxicity more preferable and acceptable than death from an infectious disease?Dying from a preventable medical mistake is also a greater risk, as that kills up to 440,000 Americans every year. Where’s the panic about that? Isn’t the idea that conventional medicine kills 440,000 people a year terrifying?! 1 in 5 elderly patients are also injured by medical care. Where are the calls to protect our aging loved ones from this threat?Were health policies more aligned with truth, we wouldn’t have these chronic disease epidemics and far fewer people would die from preventable medical mistakes. More people would lead healthy lives were they properly informed about what’s harmful and what’s healthy.Similarly, when it comes to COVID-19, there are simple strategies with which we can address this infection that does not require collapsing the global economy, creating unheard of unemployment and isolating everyone from human contact for weeks on end. You can find many articles detailing such strategies on my Coronavirus Resource Page.As noted by Ayyadurai, systems biology tells us that one size does not fit all. “We need to move to the right medicine for the right person at the right time,” he says. But this knowledge has not been applied in this pandemic. Instead, everyone is being treated as though they’re high risk for severe infection and death and therefore need to take identical precautions. So, what’s really going on here?“We have not said, ‘Hey, let’s shut down the economy to address the fact that we have skyrocketing obesity taking place, skyrocketing diabetes,” Ayyadurai says. “So, the level of contradiction, the level of hypocrisy should wake up everyone to understand that there is another agenda. There is another agenda afoot. I repeat what my mentor said: ‘When things don’t add up, take a step back and ask, what is the other agenda?’ And the only thing in a common-sense way that reveals itself to me is power, profit and control. Power, profit and control.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeLike Ayyadurai, I believe the fearmongering is being used to suppress dissent, to crash the economy and to issue medical mandates. “If you look broadly, there were massive uprisings, antiestablishment uprisings [in different countries]. Well, they’re all gone now. We don’t even hear anything about them,” Ayyadurai says.He also believes this fearmongering and social isolation mandates will be used as a way to acclimatize people to accept state wants or what a few people deem is good for everyone. “That, I think, is the milieu being set up,” he says. “That’s being teed up.” Indeed, it simply doesn’t add up when you look at mortality rates.“There’s another agenda,” Ayyadurai says. “That’s what I see, because it doesn’t make any rational sense [to crash the economy over COVID-19]. I think that’s why a number of the videos, the tweets I’ve done have gone viral, because to everyday working people, it doesn’t make sense either. They’re trying to sort this out.”Interestingly, this epidemic is taking place just a few months after Google began censoring holistic health news. So, people searching for sound nutritional strategies can no longer find them. Instead, they’re directed to Big Pharma-backed sites promoting conventional medicine.The censorship isn’t even about squashing nonscientific views anymore. Educated health professionals are being banned left and right simply for posting peer-reviewed studies showing nutraceuticals work, or that drugs or vaccines don’t work — including Ayyadurai himself, who got kicked off Twitter the day this interview was recorded over a vitamin D post.“It has essentially moved to a model of a finite set of people serving the interests of another finite set of people,” Ayyadurai says. “That’s what’s fundamentally going on. When we really look back at the history of ‘infectious diseases,’ what actually caused the real decline in infectious disease? …That came from sanitation, vitamin A, nutrition, elimination of child labor, refrigeration [and] infrastructure at the political level … Well, how did we get that? This is one layer people need to understand from a human standpoint. It came about because in the late 1800s, there was a massive force of the American working class who were militant, and they fought for those rights. People lived in squalor. No one cared for them. It was the uprising of those people and very, very powerful independently self-organizing systems, all over this country, that forced the elites to give them these basic infrastructures …So, what I see is the ability for people to organize and demand their rights and get them. That is what occurred in the late 1900s, and we got massive gains. Now look at infrastructure today. Dirty water, dirty air, dirty food … and we look at them in synergy, how they affect our body. None of that’s discussed, none of that. I think the United States has a D+ in infrastructure. The roads, the bridges and the water systems [are all crumbling]. And when you don’t fix these things in time, they affect all types of environmental things. The elite in this country do not want to address that. They want to always create a fake problem and a fake solution to consolidate power. And that’s why when you look at this [COVID-19] phenomenon that’s taking place, it’s a penultimate of it … You create massive amounts of fear so people will be willing — because they’re under economic stress, under what they think is a health [threat] — to give up their rights. And that’s where I see this headed. So, this is an interesting convergence of … economic attack, attack on people’s health, [and attack on] people’s autonomy and freedom. Truth, freedom and health are all under attack …They do not want any discussion about indigenous people’s medicines that have worked for centuries. They don’t want to talk about simple solutions … so, they suppress discourse, suppress debate, suppress freedom, and move everything away from the scientific method — which is a process where you actually have to prove stuff, which is what they claim they want to do to scientific consensus. Freedom gets suppressed and now you can move truth to scientific consensus. So, you go from suppression of freedom to fake science or outdated science at best. And then that is used to create a fake problem and a fake solution. And then, if you go to the health part, what that means is you diminish people’s health, you control people’s health, and now you have a populace which is so controlled, they don’t have the strength to fight for their freedom. So, you have the attack on freedom, the attack on truth, and the attack on health. All of those are interconnected. They too are a system from a systems perspective. Without freedom, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have health. And without health we don’t have the strength to fight for our freedom. And the way that truth actually is discovered should be through the scientific method. That’s what’s really been compromised, starting, I would say, in the late ‘50s.”To summarize, the three-pronged agenda is: Power, profit and control. To counteract that three-pronged threat, we need academic freedom and the freedom to discourse and debate.From that freedom, we get truth, and from truth, we’re able to understand health, not only physical health but also in the broadest sense the health of our systems, our infrastructure and environment. With health, we gain the strength to fight for even more freedoms.“For each one of those, there’s a solution. For example, when you go to freedom, if you look at communication, right now we are heavily relying on Google, Facebook and three major telecom companies. So, basically, five CEOs control our communication. One phone call to them, and you can essentially shut down communication … What is the solution? Well, it’s going to sound weird, but … the founding fathers of this country created an institution called the United States Postal Service. Why did they create that? Because the crown was not allowing each individual to communicate. So, the notion of ‘the press’ was all of us. There was no New York Times. Each one of us were supposed to be the press … If anyone interfered with your communications, [they got a] 20-year prison sentence. It was criminal. So, the entire postal service system was a decentralized environment enabling every American to communicate for pennies … In 1997 is when email volume overtook postal mail volume. I met with the executives of the postal service. I said, look, you guys should be living up to what you were chartered to do, which is to protect free communications. Why don’t you offer a public email service and public social media services … that would be protected by the laws of the Constitution? No one, including the government, could interfere. They thought it was a ridiculous idea … In 2011, the postal services were going out of business. Why? Because all the best parts of the postal service were privatized into DHL and FedEx. So, I again hit them really hard. The inspector general, Dave Williams, called me up. He goes, ‘Shiva, why are you attacking us?’ I said, ‘Look, you guys are not doing your job. You’re not in the postal mail business. You were supposed to be in the communications business. You are set up as a quasi-organization to protect our rights. So anyway, I did two chartered reports for them. My point is we need a digital rights act, and there is an institution [that can supply us with that].  It is the postal service, in my view. All these postal service locations could be converted to a mesh network. So, there is an opportunity to have a network by the people for the people. Now if someone wants to go use Google and Facebook and you can, but there needs to be a public common. Those few elite would object to this and have the power and control to prevent that from being implemented. Definitely. That’s why I believe we need to have a mass movement. Nothing has ever been given to us. People think slavery ends one day and we have freedom the next. Every point in human history has always been people chipping away at slavery to get freedom from the elite.”Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsAyyadurai discusses many additional issues and goes far deeper than I can summarize here, so please, listen to the interview in its entirety. He has many fascinating insights, ideas and solutions. For example, about 50 minutes in, he discusses how federally funded research systems can be improved to ensure scientific integrity and prevent scientific fraud.“We need to take power away from the academics,” he says, “and one way to do that is to force decentralization. That’s a common theme here.” He also analyzes the health care model, and discusses how health care, as a system, can be improved while simultaneously being made far less expensive.“Broadly, we need to decentralize health care. The concept of centralized health care — which is what the purpose of this [COVID-19 pandemic is] — is that next year everyone’s going to be mandated vaccines,” he says.“For them to crash the economy, to drive it into a depression, for them it’s a relatively great return on investment. You make the fed print $6 trillion, but you’re going to make $7 trillion to $8 trillion recurring revenue [by way of mandated, annual vaccinations] … So, we have to do whatever it takes to decentralize health care … When you look at these things I’ve said, it comes down to one word: Decentralization … I think the opportunity here is to start educating people. It is supposed to be We the People, and this does not mean it’s going to happen without struggle. We may have to rise up and fight in ways that we haven’t done before, just like those people did in the late 1800s, and the idea is to compel the thing. We need to build a broad-based movement bottom-up … And I think it begins with taking care of your health.” His academic background gives Ayyadurai a slightly different perspective on this outbreak, as it focuses on the foundational causes of disease rather than the conventional medical paradigm that tends to focus on pharmaceutical remedies. Ayyadurai explains:“The MIT department of biological engineering was created in 2003. The notion was … that you needed an engineering approach to biology as new advances or new discoveries were coming out in biology. That created the department of biological engineering …One of the big things that took place in 2003 that led to the formation of that department was, in an ironic way, what occurred with the human genome project starting in 1993. We went into the genome project with a reductionist view of biology. Biologists essentially thought that the number of parts meant complexity. We knew in 1993, a worm had around 20,000 genes. So, we said, OK, we’re going to start mapping out the human genome. We were at least 25 times more complex. The notion was we had about a half a million genes. By 2003, they only found 20,000 protein coding genes. That flipped biology on its head because it said, wait a minute, we have the same number of parts, and they thought genes were a reflection of complexity. That led to systems biology starting around 2003, which said, look, genes create proteins and these proteins interact. So, it’s about all these interactions … Today, that has led to this field called epigenetics, in which we know that the external environment, what we interact with, can turn on and turn off genes. I came back to MIT in 2003. I did four degrees at MIT in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering. My Master’s was in design, but I always was fascinated with medicine.” The project Ayyadurai took on for his Ph.D. thesis was to mathematically model the whole human cell. His work led to the creation of a platform called CytoSolve “cyto” standing for “cell.” This approach is different from biology, computer science and chemistry.“Biologists are essentially distributed knowledge engineers,” he says, “and the thing they’re trying to understand is this thing called the body. No different than aeronautical engineers trying to build the airplane. The difference is when we build an airplane, we actually know what we want to build. And we know the parts in biology, we’re finding the parts, that’s what they’re doing. Some biologists can win a Nobel prize just for looking at how two proteins interact. So, they’re very focused on understanding these parts. So, imagine if we could create a technology where we could take those parts, integrate them, and then essentially let them be sort of focused in their silos. But there wouldn’t be this framework that you could integrate, where you could integrate these molecular pathways. And that really created cytosol. To me, it was a big circling back because I grew up in India where my grandmother practiced traditional systems of medicine. In that system of medicine, they had diagnosis methods, they looked at you, they figured out your body type and they would figure out the right types of foods and medicines, herbs or even body work to get you back into balance. That was always seen as a ‘black art’ from a Western medicine [perspective]. [CytoSolve] lets us decipher what they were doing and actually understand these synergies. So that’s what systems biology is about. It’s taking an engineering systems approach to the body … It’s literally understanding how to diagnose and assess and identify what the problem is, and then how to administer a prescription within a few minutes. It’s essentially an ‘AI’-type model.” DailyBeast: Bill Gates Praised Pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s Lifestyle: ‘Kind of Intriguing’As noted by Ayyadurai, the COVID-19 pandemic is not only highlighting our immune health but also our economic health. We’re seeing the integration of medical policy and economic policy.“I had a very interesting discussion with a leading economist,” Ayyadurai says, “and he had a serious concern about the fact that economists are being forced to backfill in a misguided health policy, which is occurring. What he meant by that is, [they’re being told to] just use quantitative easing, which is basically printing money, and that will solve the problem. Now that entire process does two things. First of all, we have I think 10 million unemployment claims in March alone. In addition to that, you have the fact that we’re going to print money, which … if you look, since 2008 and 2009, when quantitative easing started … that has essentially been the biggest transfer of wealth — to the 0.01%, again. It is essentially a weakened earning power and the [weakened value] of the dollar. So that’s what’s occurred. Now we have this COVID-19, and we have this economic overreaction, in my opinion, from the fear-mongering. In many ways, it reflects the immune system.The immune system fundamentally wants to operate well for you and maintain homeostasis, and it’s the overreaction of a weakened and dysfunctional immune system that causes harm. Similarly, when you look at it from the economic standpoint, we have this unbridled overreaction, in my view. [We’re] not looking at what modern medicine is saying — that we should take a personalized medicine approach, right? One size doesn’t fit all. This is basically flatten the curve: Kick the can down the street. We’re just going to wait until, when? Until the vaccine is produced or until a drug comes out. The assumption is that the immune system of all of us is equally weak. That’s what this is based on. The assumption is that all of us are going to get it and all of us will suffer from it. It’s a very interesting model. Look at the person leading this health policy, Dr. Fauci. His background is from the pharmaceutical world … [and] when you look at the NIH and the CDC, these organizations are heavily, heavily influenced by pharmaceutical companies.In that environment, the model has always been never to discuss immune health, what we can do to support the immune system. It’s always under the assumption that there’s this big boogeyman, that the virus harms your body. Most medical doctors, again, they’re victims of this education. Many of them are taught the virus literally comes and attacks your body, and that a vaccine or a pharmaceutical intervention blocks it. It’s not taught broadly that [the problem is that] the dysfunctional, weakened immune system is not running on all cylinders. One part of it can overreact, and that overreaction is what goes in and attacks your own tissues. So, the issue is, we’re not having a discussion at all in the media about ‘How do you modulate that overreaction and support people’s immune health?’”Similarly, Ayyadurai notes, the economic collapse is “a result of precisely engineered governmental policies,” even though those policies, superficially, appear to be in the public’s best interest.COVID-19 meets the technical definition of a pandemic, and the World Health Organization did declare it a pandemic. However, the death toll is nowhere near that of earlier serious pandemics that would legitimately justify the extraordinary measures being deployed by the U.S. government.The Spanish flu in 1918 infected 500 million people worldwide, killing between 20 million and 50 million. The bubonic plague also killed 50 million people, wiping out a shocking 60% of the European population. This is typically what people think of when they hear the word “pandemic.”COVID-19 presently affects a tiny fraction of the global population — about 1.4 million cases out of a global population of 7.78 billion3 — and even with a death toll of 81,000 worldwide,4 COVID-19 has had a miniscule impact, having killed a mere 0.00001% of the population.Don’t get me wrong. Any death is tragic. But any given individual’s risk of dying from the epidemics of diabetes, heart disease or cancer, for example, is greater than their risk of dying from COVID-19. Why is death from lifestyle-induced disease and environmental toxicity more preferable and acceptable than death from an infectious disease?Dying from a preventable medical mistake is also a greater risk, as that kills up to 440,000 Americans every year. Where’s the panic about that? Isn’t the idea that conventional medicine kills 440,000 people a year terrifying?! 1 in 5 elderly patients are also injured by medical care. Where are the calls to protect our aging loved ones from this threat?Were health policies more aligned with truth, we wouldn’t have these chronic disease epidemics and far fewer people would die from preventable medical mistakes. More people would lead healthy lives were they properly informed about what’s harmful and what’s healthy.Similarly, when it comes to COVID-19, there are simple strategies with which we can address this infection that does not require collapsing the global economy, creating unheard of unemployment and isolating everyone from human contact for weeks on end. You can find many articles detailing such strategies on my Coronavirus Resource Page.As noted by Ayyadurai, systems biology tells us that one size does not fit all. “We need to move to the right medicine for the right person at the right time,” he says. But this knowledge has not been applied in this pandemic. Instead, everyone is being treated as though they’re high risk for severe infection and death and therefore need to take identical precautions. So, what’s really going on here?“We have not said, ‘Hey, let’s shut down the economy to address the fact that we have skyrocketing obesity taking place, skyrocketing diabetes,” Ayyadurai says. “So, the level of contradiction, the level of hypocrisy should wake up everyone to understand that there is another agenda. There is another agenda afoot. I repeat what my mentor said: ‘When things don’t add up, take a step back and ask, what is the other agenda?’ And the only thing in a common-sense way that reveals itself to me is power, profit and control. Power, profit and control.”Robert F. Kennedy Jr. exposes Bill Gates & his relationship with Big PharmaLike Ayyadurai, I believe the fearmongering is being used to suppress dissent, to crash the economy and to issue medical mandates. “If you look broadly, there were massive uprisings, antiestablishment uprisings [in different countries]. Well, they’re all gone now. We don’t even hear anything about them,” Ayyadurai says.He also believes this fearmongering and social isolation mandates will be used as a way to acclimatize people to accept state wants or what a few people deem is good for everyone. “That, I think, is the milieu being set up,” he says. “That’s being teed up.” Indeed, it simply doesn’t add up when you look at mortality rates.“There’s another agenda,” Ayyadurai says. “That’s what I see, because it doesn’t make any rational sense [to crash the economy over COVID-19]. I think that’s why a number of the videos, the tweets I’ve done have gone viral, because to everyday working people, it doesn’t make sense either. They’re trying to sort this out.”Interestingly, this epidemic is taking place just a few months after Google began censoring holistic health news. So, people searching for sound nutritional strategies can no longer find them. Instead, they’re directed to Big Pharma-backed sites promoting conventional medicine.The censorship isn’t even about squashing nonscientific views anymore. Educated health professionals are being banned left and right simply for posting peer-reviewed studies showing nutraceuticals work, or that drugs or vaccines don’t work — including Ayyadurai himself, who got kicked off Twitter the day this interview was recorded over a vitamin D post.“It has essentially moved to a model of a finite set of people serving the interests of another finite set of people,” Ayyadurai says. “That’s what’s fundamentally going on. When we really look back at the history of ‘infectious diseases,’ what actually caused the real decline in infectious disease? …That came from sanitation, vitamin A, nutrition, elimination of child labor, refrigeration [and] infrastructure at the political level … Well, how did we get that? This is one layer people need to understand from a human standpoint. It came about because in the late 1800s, there was a massive force of the American working class who were militant, and they fought for those rights. People lived in squalor. No one cared for them. It was the uprising of those people and very, very powerful independently self-organizing systems, all over this country, that forced the elites to give them these basic infrastructures …So, what I see is the ability for people to organize and demand their rights and get them. That is what occurred in the late 1900s, and we got massive gains. Now look at infrastructure today. Dirty water, dirty air, dirty food … and we look at them in synergy, how they affect our body. None of that’s discussed, none of that. I think the United States has a D+ in infrastructure. The roads, the bridges and the water systems [are all crumbling]. And when you don’t fix these things in time, they affect all types of environmental things. The elite in this country do not want to address that. They want to always create a fake problem and a fake solution to consolidate power. And that’s why when you look at this [COVID-19] phenomenon that’s taking place, it’s a penultimate of it … You create massive amounts of fear so people will be willing — because they’re under economic stress, under what they think is a health [threat] — to give up their rights. And that’s where I see this headed. So, this is an interesting convergence of … economic attack, attack on people’s health, [and attack on] people’s autonomy and freedom. Truth, freedom and health are all under attack …They do not want any discussion about indigenous people’s medicines that have worked for centuries. They don’t want to talk about simple solutions … so, they suppress discourse, suppress debate, suppress freedom, and move everything away from the scientific method — which is a process where you actually have to prove stuff, which is what they claim they want to do to scientific consensus. Freedom gets suppressed and now you can move truth to scientific consensus. So, you go from suppression of freedom to fake science or outdated science at best. And then that is used to create a fake problem and a fake solution. And then, if you go to the health part, what that means is you diminish people’s health, you control people’s health, and now you have a populace which is so controlled, they don’t have the strength to fight for their freedom. So, you have the attack on freedom, the attack on truth, and the attack on health. All of those are interconnected. They too are a system from a systems perspective. Without freedom, you can’t have truth. Without truth, you can’t have health. And without health we don’t have the strength to fight for our freedom. And the way that truth actually is discovered should be through the scientific method. That’s what’s really been compromised, starting, I would say, in the late ‘50s.”To summarize, the three-pronged agenda is: Power, profit and control. To counteract that three-pronged threat, we need academic freedom and the freedom to discourse and debate.From that freedom, we get truth, and from truth, we’re able to understand health, not only physical health but also in the broadest sense the health of our systems, our infrastructure and environment. With health, we gain the strength to fight for even more freedoms.“For each one of those, there’s a solution. For example, when you go to freedom, if you look at communication, right now we are heavily relying on Google, Facebook and three major telecom companies. So, basically, five CEOs control our communication. One phone call to them, and you can essentially shut down communication … What is the solution? Well, it’s going to sound weird, but … the founding fathers of this country created an institution called the United States Postal Service. Why did they create that? Because the crown was not allowing each individual to communicate. So, the notion of ‘the press’ was all of us. There was no New York Times. Each one of us were supposed to be the press … If anyone interfered with your communications, [they got a] 20-year prison sentence. It was criminal. So, the entire postal service system was a decentralized environment enabling every American to communicate for pennies … In 1997 is when email volume overtook postal mail volume. I met with the executives of the postal service. I said, look, you guys should be living up to what you were chartered to do, which is to protect free communications. Why don’t you offer a public email service and public social media services … that would be protected by the laws of the Constitution? No one, including the government, could interfere. They thought it was a ridiculous idea … In 2011, the postal services were going out of business. Why? Because all the best parts of the postal service were privatized into DHL and FedEx. So, I again hit them really hard. The inspector general, Dave Williams, called me up. He goes, ‘Shiva, why are you attacking us?’ I said, ‘Look, you guys are not doing your job. You’re not in the postal mail business. You were supposed to be in the communications business. You are set up as a quasi-organization to protect our rights. So anyway, I did two chartered reports for them. My point is we need a digital rights act, and there is an institution [that can supply us with that].  It is the postal service, in my view. All these postal service locations could be converted to a mesh network. So, there is an opportunity to have a network by the people for the people. Now if someone wants to go use Google and Facebook and you can, but there needs to be a public common. Those few elite would object to this and have the power and control to prevent that from being implemented. Definitely. That’s why I believe we need to have a mass movement. Nothing has ever been given to us. People think slavery ends one day and we have freedom the next. Every point in human history has always been people chipping away at slavery to get freedom from the elite.”Ayyadurai discusses many additional issues and goes far deeper than I can summarize here, so please, listen to the interview in its entirety.

Ibuprofen And COVID-19 Symptoms: Here’s What You Need to Know,"Living under the uncertainty of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has sparked many concerns and questions worldwide. Though it is widely understood that the virus spreads rapidly and the nation is in the midst of a pandemic, people grapple with how to manage the emerging infection. Communities work to restrict the movement of people, and everyone is doing his or her part to social distance. But what to do if you in fact contract the illness? How do you best treat symptoms of COVID-19?International researchers and healthcare professionals, working to provide us the most up to date information possible, are sharing some new tips in March 2020 to manage COVID-19 infections.A recent concern prompted by a recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) over the use of ibuprofen during coronavirus infections has been rectified. As of March 18, 2020, WHO and other health groups around the globe okay the use of ibuprofen in the management of COVID-19 symptoms. Beyond the drug’s usual side effects, there are no known additional negative outcomes from managing COVID-19 symptoms with this common over-the-counter medication (also referred to as Motrin or Advil).The classification of ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or for short, NSAIDs. NSAIDs are not ideal drugs for everyone and are, therefore, not recommended for everyone. Specifically, NSAIDs should not be taken by those with diminished circulation, heart disease, and a history of gastrointestinal bleeding.As effective as Ibuprofen, is it in your pantry?There has been past research indicating that some respiratory infections and diseases (ie. asthma) can worsen symptoms and cause greater complications when treated with ibuprofen. An explanation as to why this happens is not clear. But some experts believe ibuprofen ‘dampens’ the body’s immune response. However, it must be noted that no such evidence exists for COVID-19.Professor Parastou Donyai at the University of Reading reinforced this sentiment when speaking to BBC on March 17, 2020. She said, “I have not seen any scientific evidence that clearly shows a totally healthy 25-year-old taking ibuprofen for symptoms of COVID-19 is putting themselves at additional risk of complications.”Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen are well-known medications to treat fevers, diminish body aches, and manage other flu-like symptoms. As an NSAID, patients with multiple health conditions or the elderly are being urged by some doctors to be assessed for ibuprofen use on a case-by-case basis during the coronavirus outbreak. Meanwhile, acetaminophen (not an NSAID) remains a safe choice for nearly everyone impacted by infection. Acetaminophen (ie.Tylenol), tends to be an especially great supplement to other cold and flu medications. A maximum dose of acetaminophen in 24 hours is 3,000 milligrams for adults.Like ibuprofen, some misinformation has been circulating online regarding heart and asthma medications. Of particular concerns, heart medications classified as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are thought to worsen COVID-19 symptoms. ACE and ARB medications are often prescribed daily to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), improve heart function, and in some cases, prompt kidney function.As of March 24, 2020, the American Heart Association (AHA), the American College of Cardiology (ACC), and the Heart Failure Society of America (HFSA) strongly recommend that people taking these medications should continue to do so, even if they become infected with the coronavirus. There is little human research to show that ACE and ARBs medications actually worsen lung function during respiratory infections. As well, stopping your ACE or ARBs places you at greater risk of complications. In the case of an infection, untreated hypertension and decreased heart function can strain your cardiovascular system.As of now, nobody taking regular medication – especially for heart or lung disease – is recommended to stop these treatments. If you have concerns, speak to a trusted healthcare provider.Acetaminophen – Not Worth the Risk, by the Children’s Health Defense TeamUltimately, not much is known and new information is emerging daily about coronavirus. During this time, ensure you are seeking information about the management of COVID-19 from reputable sources. Turning to the WHO for regular updates is a particularly great strategy. Do not seek health information from social media outlets like a Facebook post or WhatsApp message. Seemingly casual speculation can likewise perpetuate rumors and false knowledge.If you develop signs of COVID-19 rely on your local health authority. Common signs of coronavirus include fever, sore throat, cough, aches, congestion, a tight chest, and shortness of breath. It is important that we follow information coming from health experts, governments, and researchers in the coming days.*Article originally appeared at Healthy Holistic Living.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
BREAKING: Business Insider: Bolivia Senate Approves MMS as a Treatment for COVID-19,"The Bolivian senate has approved the use of chlorine dioxide as a treatment for COVID-19.Chlorine dioxide is a type of industrial bleach. In recent years it has been hailed as a miracle cure by a vast network of advocates and conspiracy theorists.Its advocates claim that it is a “miracle mineral solution” or MMS, and can cure diseases, including cancer and malaria, and conditions such as autism. As the coronavirus pandemic spread, advocates began to claim it could also treat COVID-19, as both prevention and cure.Bolivian lawmakers approved a bill that “authorizes the preparation, marketing, supply and use of the chlorine dioxide solution for the prevention and treatment of coronavirus,” according to a statement posted on the website of the Bolivian senate.Its use is becoming more popular in South American countries, such as Bolivia, where experts say medical authorities struggle to cope with the pandemic.Before it becomes law, the motion still requires approval from Bolivia’s lower chamber and its president.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeInstitutions including the US Food and Drug Administration and similar bodies in Ireland and Canada have issued warnings against the treatment. A Business Insider investigation last year identified two deaths in the US linked to consuming MMS.According to Business Insider, the adoption of the often questioned substance by a national legislature is a striking development in the spread of medical disinformation around the coronavirus.Bolivia’s health ministry is warning against it. Nonetheless, under the proposed law, public or private laboratories would be permitted to produce the substance, but the production process “must comply with quality standards.”FOX: Doctor Claiming Covid-19 Conspiracy Tells Reporter “We Don’t Have Much Time”Under the bill, the substance would be available in pharmacies without a prescription and made available through the state health system.The Bolivian embassy in London confirmed to Business Insider that the legislation had been approved by the senate, which is controlled by the left-wing Moviemento al Socialismo (MAS) party. The party also controls the lower house, but not the presidency.The embassy also referenced a June warning from the country’s ministry of health that the substance is ineffective and dangerous. An embassy official said:“Despite official recommendations provided by the Ministry of Health of Bolivia against the use of chlorine dioxide solution to treat COVID-19, the Legislative Branch (Senate), the majority (2/3) of which is of the MAS political party, passed the law you refer to, which approves the use of said substance to treat COVID-19 patients.”The legislation is due to be sent to the lower legislative house, which is also controlled by MAS. If approved, it would then require the signature of the country’s right-wing president, Jeanine Añez, to become law. The president can approve or send the legislation back for further deliberation. However, under the Bolivian constitution, she cannot veto it entirely like a US president.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

Business Insider: A Woman’s Brain Fluid Leaked Into Her Nose After Getting a Nasal COVID-19 Test,"A woman’s brain lining was punctured when she underwent a COVID-19 nasal swab test in the US, doctors reported in a medical journal.In her 40s, the patient had an undiagnosed rare condition, and the test she received may have been carried out improperly. Because of the sequence of improbable events, the risk from nasal tests remains very low.Nonetheless, Jarrett Walsh, senior author of the paper that appeared in JAMA Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, said her case demonstrated that healthcare professionals should closely follow testing protocols.People who have had extensive sinus or skull-base surgery should exercise caution and request fr oral testing instead of nasal swab, Walsh added.Saudi Arabian Child Dies After COVID-19 Test Swab Breaks in His NoseThe woman, who has since fully recovered, had appeared for a nasal test ahead of elective hernia surgery and later noticed a clear fluid coming out of one side of her nose. She also developed a headache followed by vomiting, neck stiffness, and inability to bear light.

That resulted in her developing an encephalocele, which is a defect at the base of the skull that causes the brain’s lining to protrude into the nose, which resulted in a rupture.At the time, doctors used a shunt to drain some of the fluid, and the condition was resolved.This went unnoticed until old scans were reviewed by her new doctors, who carried out surgery to repair the defect in July.FOX: Doctor Claiming Covid-19 Conspiracy Tells Reporter “We Don’t Have Much Time”The doctors revealed that if this problem had not been treated on time, the bacteria could have traveled up the nose, or the air could have entered the skull and placed excess pressure on the brain, leading to a life-threatening brain infection.Walsh said he believes the symptoms she developed resulted from irritation to the lining of the brain. He added that though this was likely a very rare occurrence, it serves as a reminder of the need for high-quality training, as millions more tests will be given before the pandemic is over.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: Florida Police Raid COVID Data Whistleblower’s House with Guns Drawn,"Agents with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement on Monday raided the home of the former Department of Health employee who once managed Florida’s COVID-19 data dashboard and has become a vocal critic of the DeSantis administration’s handling of the pandemic since she was ousted in May.Rebekah Jones said state police entered her house around 8:30 a.m. to serve a warrant on her computer after a complaint filed by the state Department of Health. The officers seized her phone and the computer she uses to track and release data on COVID-19 cases in Florida — and held Jones and her family at gunpoint, she said. Jones posted on Twitter:“They took evidence of corruption at the state level. They claimed it was about a security breach.”FOX: DeSantis: Former Manager of Coronavirus Dashboard “Not a Data Scientist;” Faces Cyber-Stalking ChargeIn a series of tweets posted after the incident, Jones said the officers entered her home and one of them drew a gun.1/There will be no update today.At 8:30 am this morning, state police came into my house and took all my hardware and tech.They were serving a warrant on my computer after DOH filed a complaint.They pointed a gun in my face. They pointed guns at my kids.. pic.twitter.com/DE2QfOmtPU— Rebekah Jones (@GeoRebekah) December 7, 2020“I tell them my husband and my two children are upstairs… and THEN one of them draws his gun,” she tweeted.In a video posted by Jones, agents can be seen ushering her out of her house and asking who else is inside the home. Jones tells them her husband and two children are upstairs, and an officer walks toward the stairs holding up a gun while asking Jones’ husband to come down.“Do not point that gun at my children! He just pointed a gun at my children,” Jones can be heard shouting.NBC: Florida won’t make the COVID-19 vaccine mandatory, DeSantis saysFDLE spokeswoman Gretl Plessinger confirmed agents seized computer equipment at Jones’ home in Tallahassee in response to a complaint from the Department of Health.Plessinger said agents have been investigating “unauthorized access to a Department of Health messaging system” used to send out emergency alerts. The FDLE investigation led agents to believe someone at Jones’ address illegally accessed the alert system, Plessinger said in a written statement, adding:“When agents arrived, they knocked on the door and called Ms. Jones in an attempt to minimize disruption to the family. Ms. Jones refused to come to the door for 20 minutes and hung-up on agents. After several attempts and verbal notifications that law enforcement officers were there to serve a legal search warrant, Ms. Jones eventually came to the door and allowed agents to enter.”When reached Monday, a spokesperson with the Florida Department of Health referred questions about the investigation to the FDLE. Plessinger said the investigation began Nov. 10.The Tampa Bay Times reported last month that members of the State Emergency Response Team had received a message on that date, urging them to “speak up before another 17,000 people are dead.” At the time, a spokesman with the Department of Health said the state had not identified the person responsible for sending the message.ABC: FLORIDA STAYS OPEN: Gov DeSantis Says No New Shutdowns in the Sunshine StateVideo of Monday’s raid prompted shocked reactions online, with many questioning whether the show of force was necessary.“Horrifying. Why are guns being drawn out for a ‘data breach’?” tweeted state Rep. Anna V. Eskamani, an Orlando Democrat.In her tweets, Jones blamed Gov. Ron DeSantis for the raid and said she would continue to operate her COVID-19 data dashboard. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday evening. Jones tweeted:“If Desantis thought pointing a gun in my face was a good way to get me to shut up, he’s about to learn just how wrong he was. I’ll have a new computer tomorrow. And then I’m going to get back to work.”Jones, who was geographic information systems manager in the department’s Division of Disease Control and Health Protection, said she was fired from her post in May for refusing to manipulate COVID-19 data after being asked to do so.The story made national headlines, and top Democrats in the state called for an investigation into her firing. DeSantis, however, downplayed her role in developing the online dashboard, saying she isn’t an epidemiologist and that she should have been fired after being charged with cyberstalking. The Governor said in May:“I have a zero tolerance policy for sexual harassment, so her supervisor dismissed her because of a lot of those reasons, and it was a totally valid way, but she should have been dismissed, long before that.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"The Guardian: Obesity Increases Risk of Covid-19 Death by 48%, Study Finds","A new study from researchers at the University of North Carolina found that obesity increases the risk of contracting the coronavirus, might make vaccines against the virus less effective, an increases the chance of death from the virus. The findings, which the lead researcher described as “scary”, show that the risks for people with obesity are greater than previously thought. The study, a collaborative effort between the University of North Carolina (UNC), Saudi Health Council and World Bank, will increase pressure on governments to tackle obesity, including in the UK, where Boris Johnson has put himself in charge of a drive to reduce the nation’s weight.The researchers say there’s also concern a vaccine could be less effective for people with obesity due to a weakened immune response.Scientists at UNC reviewed data from 75 studies conducted between January and June involving 400,000 coronavirus patients.Obesity Reaches Global Crisis PointThey found obese people had a 46 percent greater risk of catching Covid-19 than non-obese people, and a 113 percent increased risk of hospitalization. Plus, their chances of ending up in the intensive care unit were 74 percent greater than those who were not obese. They also had a 48 percent greater risk of dying from the virus.Obesity was already a known risk factor for more severe cases of Covid-19 because of the underlying health conditions associated with the condition, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure.The researchers noted that “the prevalence of individuals with obesity in hospitalized patients was much higher than that in nonhospitalized patients.” They cited a report on 5,700 obese patients in New York City, which showed 42 percent of hospitalized Covid-19 patients were obese compared to only 22 percent of the city’s population.Obesity poised to overtake smoking as leading preventable cause of cancerThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 42 percent of the US adult population was considered obese in 2017-2018.Melinda Beck, a professor at UNC’s Gillings School of Global Public Health who worked on the study, said in a statement:“Individuals with obesity are also more likely to experience physical ailments that make fighting this disease harder, such as sleep apnea, which increases pulmonary hypertension, or a body mass index that increases difficulties in a hospital setting with intubation.”As research continues on a potential coronavirus vaccine, Beck pointed to previous research finding a link between adult obesity and a less effective flu vaccine. She suggested the same could be true for Covid-19, saying:“However, we are not saying that the vaccine will be ineffective in populations with obesity, but rather that obesity should be considered as a modifying factor to be considered for vaccine testing. Even a less protective vaccine will still offer some level of immunity.”Growing evidence shows that obesity increases the risks of hospitalization, the severity of illness, and sometimes death with any viral respiratory infections, the researchers wrote, “increasing the likelihood that obesity may also independently increase the risk for Covid-19.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19","The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation gave more money from 2018-2019 to the World Health Organization than any entity except the U.S. government, who recently cut ties with the organization.Melinda Gates, the wife of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, has revealed who she believes should be the first to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.In a Q&A with TIME ahead of the 2020 Global Vaccines Summit, Gates stated that black people should be second-in-line to be vaccinated immediately after health care workers.“The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom” by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna TachoverAt the June 4 summit, co-chair Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation would give $1.6 billion to the Vaccine Alliance (GAVI) over the next five years.TIME: The scale of anti-racism protests we’re seeing right now is incredible. How does this moment relate to your work in health equity? Gates: What happened to George Floyd was brutal and horrible and should never happen to anyone, anywhere. This is a moment of reckoning in the United States. We all need to really pause during this time and learn as best we can from it. Even before we saw this senseless death, COVID had already started to show us gaps and structural problems in our country. We are seeing black men die at a disproportionate rate. We know the way out of COVID-19 will be a vaccine, and it needs to go out equitably.How do you make sure that happens?You make sure the vaccine doesn’t go to the highest bidder. GAVI uses a pooled set of resources from governments and private citizens, so you can make sure that when you go to purchase the vaccine, you purchase it in bulk at low prices. We’ve gotten the delivery system, over 20 years, really set up appropriately. This pledging event means governments around the world will step up in global cooperation to all say, ‘We care about this vaccine getting out equitably,’ [since their contributions will help GAVI secure and distribute doses when they become available].The first people that need this vaccine are the 60 million health care workers around the world. They deserve to get it before anybody else. Then you start tiering.Who needs it after health care workers? In the U.S., that would be black people next, quite honestly, and many other people of color. They are having disproportionate effects from COVID-19. From there, people with underlying health conditions, and then people who are older. Those are the ones who all need it first. We also need to think about essential workers who are keeping our grocery stores open for us so we can buy food, or who are making sure that food moves through the warehouses.When do you think most people will get vaccinated?We’re probably 18 months out from that.Do you have concerns about how a Trump Administration—if Trump is still President at the time—will distribute the vaccine? We’re all concerned that the vaccine not go to the highest bidder. There are some signs that early doses may get bought up, and I think that would be a shame for the entire world. It’s important for world leaders to step up and lock arms and say, ‘This is about everybody, whether you live in India, or Tanzania, or Switzerland.’How will the U.S. pulling out of the WHO affect the organization’s work? The WHO is not a perfect institution. No institution is perfect. But the middle of a pandemic is the last moment you should be making changes or pulling out. WHO was set up to deal with pandemics like this, to deal with things like smallpox, to deal with things like polio. The U.S government is the largest funder of the WHO. Nobody can replace the funding the U.S was putting into the WHO.This decision will touch everything at the WHO. I worry deeply about polio. I’m worried deeply about measles. I’m worried about Ebola.If we didn’t think we were global, COVID has certainly pointed it out to us. The United States was a founding member of the WHO after World War II because we saw how important it was. To be going back on something that we know will help all of us, that’s just senseless. It’s another thing to do a postmortem when this crisis is over and say, ‘Hey, we need some structural changes to WHO, or we need different governance,’ but not in the middle of a pandemic. You just don’t do that.Has the global health community ever faced a challenge like COVID-19? No. The Spanish influenza in 1918, I guess you could say. But we weren’t traveling on planes the way we are now.The vaccine-creation challenge is also unprecedented, both in terms of the speed of development and the number of doses. The world has never created 7 billion doses of a vaccine in this short amount of time. The good thing is the world is actually more coordinated than I think many people realize, and that’s lucky.What gives you hope right now?I have pictures here, where I’m sitting in my office, of moms I’ve met all over the developing world who have told me about the lengths they go to get their kids vaccines. They walk 15 kilometers in the heat, they’re carrying their baby on their back. These moms know the difference that vaccines make in their kids’ lives. When I think about them, they give me so much hope, even when I see some of the pushback on vaccines here in the United States.The other thing that gives me hope is this next generation. I’m seeing the way they talk about race. They’re willing to stand up and listen, they’re willing to go march in the streets and say, ‘This isn’t right.’ That gives me a lot of hope.1",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

CNN: Pfizer to Start Testing its Covid-19 Vaccine in Children as Young as 12,"Pfizer, one of four companies in the U.S. working to develop a potential coronavirus vaccine, announced that it had received FDA approval to include children as young as twelve years old to participate in its ongoing trials.This expansion follows continued calls from health officials to expand testing to younger populations to ensure an eventual vaccine will be safe and effective for them.Until now, people under the age of sixteen had not been included in any U.S. vaccine trials. L.J. Tan, chief strategy officer of the Immunization Action Coalition, said:“I think this is a really big deal. Without clinical trials actually done in children, the only way to actually extend the use of the COVID-19 vaccine into children would be to rely on the adult data.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeEarlier this month, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) wrote a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, urging them to authorize including children in vaccine testing. AAP President Sara Goza wrote:“Children must be included in vaccine trials to best understand any potential unique immune responses and/or unique safety concerns.”She then added that it would be unethical “to allow children to take on great burdens during this pandemic but not have the opportunity to benefit from a vaccine, or to delay that benefit for an extended period of time, because they have not been included in vaccine trials.”The NIH Claims Joint Ownership of Moderna’s Coronavirus VaccinePediatricians and infectious disease experts say it made sense to start the vaccine trials with older participants who have a higher risk of more serious illness from COVID-19. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics, epidemiology, and population health at Stanford University, who chairs the AAP committee on infectious diseases, is among the pediatricians who wrote the FDA to urge them to include children in trials. She explained:“Children have not been the main focus at this point because of the rush to get these trials going in adults. For almost any other vaccine trial, you’re almost always going to start in adults anyway to find if there’s a safety signal in the adult population before you move into the pediatric population,”And, since COVID-19 vaccine development is moving so quickly, pediatricians have hoped that children wouldn’t be left behind. She added:“With all of the proper precautions in place and sufficient safety data from adult studies, progressing to trials in older children would be important.”In addition to Pfizer and Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca are also conducting late-stage coronavirus vaccine trials.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
LA TIMES: The Government May Start Tracking Your Poop to Find People With COVID-19,"The federal government is looking at a new strategy for monitoring the spread of the deadly coronavirus, and it involves poop. The U.S. is considering tracking the spread of the virus through sewage systems as a way to predict where the next hot spot may be.Jay Butler, deputy director for infectious diseases at the CDC, suggested the interesting possibility on Monday in a conference call with private-sector representatives, according to POLITICO. Butler fielded prescreened questions on a range of buttoned-up topics, including face-mask use, sick leave, and contact tracing. He also received a question about wastewater. He said:“There is not a lot of evidence of transmission through stools. I know at least one tabloid in the U.K. got a lot of coverage by someone speculating that Covid-19 could be spread by flatulence or, to quote the headline, by farting. There really is not a lot of science behind that.”But, he continued, the virus can sometimes be present in human waste — and that may be a feature, not a bug. He added:“It does raise the intriguing possibility, though, that wastewater could potentially be monitored for the presence of the RNA as a marker for whether or not it’s in the community. If you’re new to public health, that may seem really odd but that’s actually a practice that’s been done for literally decades to look for reemergence of polio viruses in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeWastewater surveillance has been used for years in developing countries to detect outbreaks of polio, In the U.S., it has recently been used to track opioid use within communities. Though it is not doing so yet, A CDC spokesperson confirmed that the agency is considering wastewater as part of its response to the pandemic. The spokesperson said in a statement:“At this time, CDC is exploring the potential for wastewater testing to inform the response, but we are not conducting any testing at CDC.” “However, there are external groups that are currently conducting wastewater testing.”Because the novel coronavirus can be detected in feces within three days of infection — days before most individuals begin showing symptoms — there is hope that wastewater monitoring could provide an early warning of new outbreaks of the virus. Even if testing capacity ramps up, monitoring sewers could alert public health and other local and state government officials to a coming wave of infections days before patients need hospital beds.Peter Grevatt, a former EPA water official who now runs the nonprofit Water Research Foundation, said recent research out of the Netherlands has shown that the virus’ genetic material, or RNA, can be detected in wastewater as much as two weeks before the first diagnosis of a sick patient by a doctor. He said:“There is some near-term potential to use this sewer-shed monitoring as a signal of a trend, and it seems that there could be tremendous value in that as we’re reopening economies around the world and there’s so much uncertainty about what will happen next.”Grevatt said there are still significant scientific gaps that limit the method’s application.While wastewater monitoring can detect the presence of the virus in the community, researchers can’t yet correlate the number of infected individuals with the concentrations of virus they find. That’s because it’s not yet known how shedding rates vary among individuals, including among those with moderate, severe, or asymptomatic cases of Covid-19. Scientists also don’t know how long individuals keep shedding the virus after they recover.Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsThe EPA, which regulates wastewater treatment plants, said it is coordinating with the CDC to kick off scientifically sound monitoring in areas hit hard by the virus. The agency said in a statement:“EPA is currently coordinating sewage sampling and storage protocols with CDC to start sewage surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 with wastewater utilities in multiple cities with a high number of current confirmed cases.”The relationship between Covid-19 and No. 2 has also sparked interest in the White House and at the Department of Homeland Security. In an April 21 document listing DHS’ unanswered questions about the pandemic, the department raised questions about the novel coronavirus and feces.Newsha Ghaeli, co-founder and president of startup Biobot, said in an interview that starting in late March, her company started collecting samples of wastewater from 170 treatment plants in 37 states, including Massachusetts, New York and Washington, and have been generating and sharing with local municipalities weekly case estimates of how much evidence of the virus is in the samples. Ghaeli said her company strives to help officials get early warnings if the virus appears to be reemerging so that they can try to contain new outbreaks. She said:“What makes wastewater epidemiology such a great addition to the surveillance framework that communities are putting together right now [is] because it’s such a quick and relatively inexpensive way to get trend data or get a pulse on the scope of the outbreak in communities and understand how it’s trending over time.”Meanwhile, members of the White House coronavirus task force have had at least one conversation about the potential for aerosolized feces to spread the virus in buildings. The concern isn’t hypothetical; in 2003, officials said SARS — also a type of coronavirus — seemed to have spread in one large Hong Kong apartment building through malfunctioning bathroom pipes, according to a Washington Post report. A top Hong Kong health official told the Post back then:“When the bathroom was in use, with the door closed and the exhaust fan switched on, there could be negative pressure to extract contaminated droplets into the bathroom. Contaminated droplets could then have been deposited on various surfaces such as floor mats, towels, toiletries and other bathroom equipment.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
NEWSWEEK: Doubts over Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine After Animals Tested Catch Virus,"The Oxford University vaccine lauded as a “front runner” in the race to develop a coronavirus treatment does not stop the virus in monkeys and may only be partially effective, experts warn.The British government has pledged to invest $24 million to support teams at Oxford University joined in the global race to find a vaccine. However, following the publication of detailed trial results last week, it was discovered that the vaccine failed to prevent monkeys from catching the COVID-19 virus.The vaccine, called ChAdOx1, was trialed in rhesus macaque monkeys, exposing six of them to COVID-19. A control group of three non-vaccinated monkeys was also infected. Then, both the immunized and non-immunized monkeys were monitored for seven days for signs of developing COVID-19.This has led to experts doubting the vaccine’s effectiveness, should it be approved for more extensive use among the population, and in particular about whether it will be able to prevent the spread of the virus between affected individuals.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeFormer Harvard Medical School professor Dr. William Haseltine, who had a pivotal role in the development of early HIV/Aids treatments, said:“It is crystal clear that the vaccine did not provide sterilizing immunity to the virus challenge, the gold standard for any vaccine. It may provide partial protection.”“All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged, as judged by recovery of virus genomic RNA from nasal secretions.”WHO Experimenting on African Children Without Informed ConsentHe wrote in an article on Forbes:“There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from this site in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals. Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”Dr. Haseltine added that although all of the monkeys were infected with the virus, none suffered from pneumonia, which suggests the vaccine could help fight the severity of COVID-19, which may give hope to some.Dr. Penny Ward, a visiting professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King’s College London, said:“It is helpful to see that monkeys vaccinated with this SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not have any evidence of enhanced lung pathology and that, despite some evidence of upper respiratory tract infection by SARS COV2 after high viral load virus challenge, monkeys given the vaccine did not have any evidence of pneumonia.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

CBS: Concerns Arise as People Receive Positive COVID-19 Results But Never Got Tested,"Although coronavirus testing has been made more available across the country, some Florida residents say there are problems getting an accurate grasp of how much coronavirus is in their community.The problem has nothing to do with being able to get tested, but instead the results. Unbelievably, the most recent issue is getting back results that aren’t even yours.According to WWSB in Sarasota, this happened to Mindy Clark, who had gone to the drive-thru testing sight at Manatee Rural Health. But before she was able to get swabbed, she left the line because she realized it was for people with symptoms only. Clark shared:“I got a call asking for me, and they told me that I had tested positive. I was like, ‘Positive for what?” Then, the lady said for COVID, and I said, ‘That’s impossible. I never got tested, Ma’am.’I told them they needed to take this off my record, and they said I had to prove it to them that I wasn’t positive.”She tested negative two days later, and also tested negative for the antibodies. According to many WWSB viewers, this hasn’t only happened to Clark.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeClark says if she and many others have been incorrectly identified as positive in the state’s system so easily, how accurate are the numbers that are released daily? She added:“It’s such a bad time. These last five months have been so bad. People don’t need these added mistakes. Everyone is already so nervous and trying so hard, and these mistakes are really causing more anxiety in people.” Dr. Jay Wolfson, Public Health & Medicine Professor for the University of South Florida, explained:“This is part of the testing mechanism problem. People are sitting in their cars, sometimes for hours, or standing in line, six feet apart sometimes for hours. You’re registered though, you’re number 15 in line, and you are Jay Wolfson. If Jay Wolfson says he can’t wait any longer and he leaves, it will get number 15 and now get Rebecca Fernandez, who was standing behind him, and she tests positive, and then everyone from then on gets the wrong results. There has to be a better way to do this.”If you’ve received a test result, but were never actually tested for COVID-19, be sure to call the Florida Department of Health and get it sorted out. Making sure those results are removed from your health record and the COVID-19 database.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: Breaking: NY State Assembly Introduces Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccine Bill,"A Manhattan lawmaker is proposing a COVID-19 vaccine mandate that would depend on how people respond to the arrival of vaccines in New York.Assembly person Linda Rosenthal, who represents New York’s 67th Assembly District, recently proposed the legislation, which is currently known as “A11179.”Summarized on the New York State Senate website, if enacted into law, A11179 “requires a COVID-19 vaccine to be administered in accordance with the department of health’s COVID-19 vaccination administration program and mandates vaccination in certain situations.”Religious Leaders in New York Come Out Against Mandatory VaccinationsThis legislation does not propose an automatic requirement for vaccination when one becomes available. Instead, it’s based on the response. The legislation says:“If public health officials determine that residents of the state are not developing sufficient immunity from COVID-19, the department shall mandate vaccination for all individuals or groups of individuals who, as shown by clinical data, are proven to be safe to receive such vaccine.”\Arizona state lawmaker: Mandatory vaccines are communist, explains she has vaccine injured childThe legislation goes on to note that anyone who is exempted by a licensed medical professional would not have to be vaccinated.After it was introduced, the bill was referred to a committee for further examination and discussion.To read the proposed legislation in its entirety, click/tap here.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
TIME: COVID-19 Vaccinations May Be Required for Athletes and Fans to Attend Tokyo Olympics,"Participants and fans arriving for next year’s postponed Tokyo Olympics are expected to face COVID-19 vaccination requirements.The announcement came Monday after Thomas Bach, President of the International Olympic Committee, finally met with Japan’s new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga after the Summer Olympics were postponed almost eight months because of the global pandemic. Bach said:“In order to protect the Japanese people and out of respect for the Japanese people, the IOC will undertake great effort so that as many [people] as possible — Olympic participants and visitors — will arrive here [with a] vaccine if by then a vaccine is available. This makes us all very confident that we can have spectators in the Olympics stadium next year and that spectators will enjoy a safe environment.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeSome athletes and fans from abroad are almost certain to reject any vaccination requirement, which Bach has hinted previously could be almost mandatory for Olympic “solidarity.”The Olympics are scheduled to open on July 23, 2021. Bach is currently in Tokyo for two days of meetings with politicians and Summer Games organizers to persuade the Japanese public that it’s safe to hold the Olympics during a pandemic.Japan has held baseball games recently with near-capacity crowds of 30,000 fans at some stadiums. It has also held an exhibition gymnastic meet attended by several thousand fans, with 22 athletes joining from abroad. The country’s citizens are almost 100 percent compliant in mask-wearing.The NIH Claims Joint Ownership of Moderna’s Coronavirus VaccineLast week pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced promising early data on its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, and on Monday, Moderna made a similar announcement. There have also been advancements in rapid coronavirus testing.Several polls have shown the Japanese public to be ambivalent about hosting the Olympic Games amid more substantial concerns, such as the country’s slumping economy. Last year, a government audit report said the bill for hosting the Olympics could reach $25 billion. All but $5.6 billion is public money.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

Smith told Fox 5 Atlanta:“That blew my mind all the way up. It’s crazy to me that we have all of these tests that could be giving out false negatives or positives.

Smith said:“Every three to four weeks I get really sick, start vomiting and I end up in the hospital. So now I have to wait three weeks to find out when I can get surgery again.”Smith said he’s feeling some coronavirus symptoms now, so he believes the CVS test could be a false negative.

All Monkeys in Crucial Coronavirus Trial Contract Covid-19 – Denting Hopes of Vaccine,"A coronavirus vaccine developed by scientists at Oxford University may not prevent people from becoming infected with the disease, experts have warned.In the latest animal trials of the vaccine, carried out on monkeys, all six primates in the test went on to catch deadly Covid-19, including three that had been vaccinated.Dr William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor, said the trial led to the three vaccinated primates having the same amount of virus in their noses as the three non-vaccinated primates.The results suggests the vaccine, which has received £90 million in government investment, may not halt the spread of the coronavirus.The vaccine treatment received £90 million in government investmentInitial reports last week said the vaccine offered “some” immunity against the virus, as it stopped it from making its way into the lungs.The vaccine is currently known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and is undergoing its first human clinical trial.Nations have stepped up efforts to tackle the deadly virus, increasing funding all over the world.Earlier today, a professor at Imperial College London, said it is unlikely a working vaccine will be ready this year.The vaccine is currently known as ChAdOx1 nCov-19, and is undergoing its first human clinical trialDespite ministers claiming 30 million doses of the vaccine will be ready by September, the professor said people should not have false expectations.Discussing the Oxford vaccine, Dr Haseltine wrote for Forbes:“All of the vaccinated monkeys treated with the Oxford vaccine became infected when challenged.“There was no difference in the amount of viral RNA detected from (nasal secretions) in the vaccinated monkeys as compared to the unvaccinated animals.“Which is to say, all vaccinated animals were infected.”Nations have stepped up efforts to tackle the deadly virus, increasing funding all over the worldProfessor of Molecular Biology at Nottingham University, John Ball, warned:“The amount of virus genome detected in the noses of the vaccinated and un-vaccinated monkeys was the same and this is concerning.“If this represents infectious virus and a similar thing occurs in humans, then vaccinated people can still be infected and shed large amounts of virus.“This could potentially spread to others in the community.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

She is now struggling to live.Lebedeva had been head of the emergency department at the Medical-Sanitary Unit No 2 in Star City and was involved in treating the first patient, reports say.After the initial coronavirus infection, it is believed to have spread amongst health workers connected to Lebedeva.BREAKING: RFK Jr. Asks if Dr. Shiva Owning a Vaccine Company & Partnering with Microsoft is Why He’s Splintering the MovementABC: YouTube CEO Yanks Video of Urgent Care MDs Talking About COVID-19It appears Lebedeva was directly involved in the treatment of Star City’s ‘patient zero’ – a top trainer who had been in immediate contact with cosmonauts. Lebedeva was being treated in Moscow and fell from the sixth floor of the Federal Biomedical Agency in an apparent suicide.Star City’s ‘patient zero’ was one of the heads of the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre, according to Moskovsky Komsomolets (MK) newspaper.All cosmonauts and astronauts reside in the city before traveling to the International Space Station.By early last week, six people had developed the virus in Star City, although unofficial accounts indicate the number was 22.NY POST: New Jersey Driver Crashes Car After Passing Out From Wearing N95 MaskAccording to Russian media, colleagues say Lebedeva had faced “accusations from her superiors that she had not taken sufficient measures to ensure the safety of her employees which resulted in the infecting of several health workers”.Olga Minina, head of the Star City hospital where Lebedev worked, was among those infected.It is uncertain whether the initial ‘patient zero’ had any contact with cosmonauts who have since flown to the space station.The latest crew to travel to the space station – NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy along with Russian cosmonauts Anatoly Ivanishin and Ivan Vagner – left Star City on March 24 before going to Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

I want to fully disclose that I went to the hospital where they are now saying the tests are incorrect.)The Florida Department of Health released its daily coronavirus testing report showing a statewide positivity rate of 11 percent, but FOX 35 News investigated and quickly noticed some shocking positivity rates.Numerous labs have reported a 100 percent positivity rate, indicating every single person tested was positive. Then other labs had very high positivity rates. Orlando’s FOX 35 discovered that testing sites like Centra Care reported that of the 83 people tested, ALL tested positive. Next, NCF Diagnostics in Alachua said 88 percent of tests were positive.The NIH Claims Joint Ownership of Moderna’s Coronavirus VaccineThe Times: Coronavirus May Vanish Too Fast for Vaccine TrialThe network began questioning how that could be the case, so they contacted every local location mentioned in the report to investigate the astronomical numbers.

Orlando Health’s positivity rate is only 9.4 percent, not 98 percent as in the report.The report also showed that the Orlando Veteran’s Medical Center had a positivity rate of 76 percent. A spokesperson for the VA told FOX 35 News on Tuesday that this does not reflect their numbers and that the positivity rate for the center is actually 6 percent.FOX 35 News has yet to hear from the Florida Department of Health or the other labs to explain how errors occurred on an official report.

California Nurse Tests Positive for Covid One Week After Receiving Vaccine,"A California nurse tested positive for COVID-19 just one week after he received the Pfizer vaccine. The nurse, identified as Matthew W., got the first dose of the vaccine on Dec. 18 and only experienced slight arm soreness at the time.Within six days, the 45-year-old began to experience chills, muscle pain and fatigue, all of which have been identified as symptoms of the coronavirus.Matthew had been working a shift in the COVID-19 unit of his hospital the day he felt ill, and he later took a test for the virus that confirmed he was positive, according to reports.Infectious disease specialist Christian Ramers, who works with Family Health Centers out of San Diego, said that it is not unexpected for someone who has been vaccinated to contract the virus. He explained that it takes a while for the vaccine to develop its protection from COVID-19. Ramers added:“We know from the vaccine clinical trials that it’s going to take about 10 to 14 days for you to start to develop protection from the vaccine.”Ramers noted that the first dose of the vaccine does not provide complete protection from the virus on its own, adding:“That first dose we think gives you somewhere around 50 percent, and you need that second dose to get up to 95 percent.”He went on to explain that it is possible Matthew had contracted the virus prior to receiving that first shot on Dec. 18. With the coronavirus incubation period lasting nearly 14 days, he may have not begun to show symptoms until after he was already vaccinated. Ramers said:“You hear health practitioners being very optimistic about it being the beginning of the end, but it’s going to be a slow roll, weeks to months as we roll out the vaccine.”The vaccine has begun to roll out slowly across the United States, with many first responders and health care workers being among the first to receive it.Earlier this week, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris received her first dose of the vaccine and encouraged Americans to get theirs once it is available. She said at the time:“It is relatively painless. It happens really quickly. It is safe. Literally, this is about saving lives. I trust the scientists, and it is the scientists who created and approved this vaccine.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"DOD Awards $138 Million Contract, Enabling Prefilled Syringes for Future COVID-19 Vaccine","The Department of Defense announced this week a $138 million contract for “Project Jumpstart” and “RAPID USA,” to expand U.S. production capability for domestically manufactured medical-grade injection devices.A statement attributed to Lt. Col. Mike Andrews, a Department of Defense spokesman said:“Today the Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, announce a $138 million contract with ApiJect Systems America for “Project Jumpstart” and “RAPID USA,” which together will dramatically expand U.S. production capability for domestically manufactured, medical-grade injection devices starting by October 2020. Spearheaded by the DOD’s Joint Acquisition Task Force (JATF), in coordination with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response, the contract will support “Jumpstart” to create a U.S.-based, high-speed supply chain for prefilled syringes beginning later this year by using well-established Blow-Fill-Seal (BFS) aseptic plastics manufacturing technology, suitable for combatting COVID-19 when a safe and proven vaccine becomes available.By immediately upgrading a sufficient number of existing domestic BFS facilities with installations of filling-line and technical improvements, “Jumpstart” will enable the manufacture of more than 100 million prefilled syringes for distribution across the United States by year-end 2020.The contract also enables ApiJect Systems America to accelerate the launch of RAPID USA manufactured in new and permanent U.S.-based BFS facilities with the ultimate production goal of over 500 million prefilled syringes (doses) in 2021. This effort will be executed initially in Connecticut, South Carolina and Illinois, with potential expansion to other U.S.-based locations. RAPID will provide increased lifesaving capability against future national health emergencies that require population-scale vaccine administration on an urgent basis.RAPID’s permanent fill-finish production capability will help significantly decrease the United States’ dependence on offshore supply chains and its reliance on older technologies with much longer production lead times. These supplies can be used if a successful SARS-COV-2 vaccine is oral or intranasal rather than injectable.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

He said:“These offenses should have been met with far more stringent measures. When it comes to a matter of deterrence, the sentences imposed are likely to have little to no effect on other like-minded individuals.”Their attorney, Jonathon Hughes, told the Associated Press that he will appeal for a lesser sentence next week.

I was afforded the opportunity to enter the islands during these trying times and I abused it. I am humbly asking for the forgiveness of the community.”Hughes said the sentence is the first of its kind, adding that Mack’s family is concerned:“They’re worried for her because she’s in prison in a foreign country on her own.

In fact, Boyle was the one who called for biowarfare legislation at the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972, and the one who drafted the Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989, which was passed unanimously by both houses of Congress and signed into law by George Bush, Sr.At the time of this recording, February 14, 2020, more than 50,000 people in China had been infected with the virus. Certainly, it does not originate from infected bat soup.As a result of Boyle’s antibiological warfare work, which goes back to the early days of the Reagan administration — a time in which they were using DNA genetic engineering to manufacture biological weapons — Boyle has carefully followed “mysterious outbreaks of disease in both humans and animals around the world” that have appeared since then.“My biowarfare antiterrorism act was specifically designed to not only to deal with regular biological weapons but also with DNA genetic engineering for biological weapons that was just coming into its infancy when the BWC was being drafted. Even though the BWC would cover DNA genetic engineering, I wanted to make it clear by name that it was covered. I also made it clear [that] it covered synthetic biology as well,” Boyle says.“So, when these unexplained mysterious illnesses break out, I monitor them a while and usually I just conclude they can be explained by normal reasons: lack of sanitation, poverty, things of that nature. But in Wuhan it seemed pretty suspicious to me. There is this Biosafety Level 4 facility there in Wuhan. It’s the first in China, and it was specifically set up to deal with the coronavirus and SARS. SARS is basically a weaponized version of the coronavirus. There have been leaks before of SARS out of this facility, and indeed the only reason for these BSL-4 facilities, based on my experience, is the research, development, testing and stockpiling of offensive biological weapons. For that reason, I stated my opinion: That this Wuhan coronavirus leaked out of that BSL-4 facility … maybe mid-November … and the Chinese government has been lying about it and covering up ever since.” Click “Shop Now” to view my personal arsenal kit! XO ~ ErinThe first reported case of COVID-19 infection was December 1, 2019. Depending on the incubation period, which is still unknown, the initial lead, provided there was one, might have occurred anywhere in November. The official estimate is a 14-day incubation period, but a British health expert believes it’s 24 days, and North Korean biological warfare experts believe it’s 30 days, Boyle says.“As for Wuhan and Hubei Province, they’re basically under martial law. There’s no other word for it. If you read the statements by President Xi and his assistants, they’ve made it very clear they’re at war here, and that is correct. They’re at war with their own biological warfare agent. President Xi just fired the party apparatchiks in charge of this and has brought in trusted military personnel to handle it, as well as large numbers of PLA [People’s Liberation Army] forces saying they’re health care workers. They don’t look like health care workers to me. So, as of now, that’s my best reading of the situation.”When asked about rumors the COVID-19 virus might have been stolen from a high-security laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, Boyle says:“It could have been. I want to make it clear that, in my opinion they were already working on that at the Wuhan BSL-4 facility. They were working on a biological warfare weapon involving SARS, which is a coronavirus to begin with. We do know that Dr. [Yoshihiro] Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin … resurrected the Spanish flu virus for the Pentagon, obviously for weapons purposes, and he specializes in mating the Spanish flu virus to all sorts of hideous biowarfare instrumentalities. And there was a record of him shipping his products to Winnipeg. Winnipeg is Canada’s equivalent of our own Fort Detrick. It’s a BSL-4 facility, and yes, they research, develop tests, manufacture and stockpile every type of hideous biological warfare weapon that we know of. So, some of this technology could have been stolen from Winnipeg. I don’t know about that but, as I said, the Wuhan BSL-4 was already working on this to begin with. They had already developed SARS. SARS had leaked out two to three times before this, and it seems they were turbocharging SARS, which is what [COVID-19] looks to be. This is a brand-new generation of biowarfare weapons we haven’t seen before. Its lethality goes from 15%, as estimated by Lancet, up to 17% to 18% by a British health official and even Chinese statistics. Its infectivity is 83%. It can infect maybe three to four people for every person infected. It has gain of function properties, which means it travels through air at least 6 or 7 feet, and … there are reports that even contaminated human feces give it off, that the human feces radiate off maybe 6 or 7 feet. So, we’ve never seen anything like this before in the history of biological warfare, at least in the public record.I want to make it clear: I have never worked for the United States government. I’ve never had a security clearance. I’ve never had access to any type of secret information. I just read what is in the public record and the scientific record and try to draw my own conclusions, and that’s what I’m giving you today. I could change my opinion if people can provide me reputable scientific evidence to the contrary.Right now, I’m standing by my conclusion that it leaked out of the Wuhan BSL-4, the highest level of the Chinese government has known about it, they’ve been covering it up from the get-go, until they informed the WHO at the end of December.”NY Post: North Korean Official Reportedly Executed for Breaking Coronavirus QuarantineAs noted by Boyle, the Wuhan lab is a designated WHO research lab, which may sound odd, considering these facilities specialize in developing and researching dangerous pathogens that can easily be turned into bioweapons.According to Boyle, we should not be surprised however, as “WHO is up to its eyeballs in this type of work and has been for quite some time.” The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the drug industry also appear to have had their hand in many of the outbreaks of what appear to be weaponized viruses.“I won’t go through the long history of big pharma getting involved in this. There’s huge amounts of money here. I believe the West Africa Ebola pandemic originated out of the US BSL-4 facility in Sierra Leone, and [that] they were testing out a so-called vaccine that contained live Ebola and gave it to these poor people,” Boyle says.“As for the CDC, it has been involved in every … BSL-4 biological warfare death science you could possibly imagine … It’s a matter of public record that during the Reagan administration, the CDC and the American Type Culture Collection sent 40 shipments of weapons-grade biological warfare agents to Saddam Hussein in Iraq, in the hope and expectation that he would weaponize these agents and use them against Iran …Of course, the problem is that when that war was over … an order was given to U.S. military forces to blow up Saddam Hussein’s biological warfare facilities, and that’s not how you deal with biological warfare weapons … [It] contaminated our own troops, and that was a causative factor in the Gulf War Syndrome that … murdered about 11,000 U.S. troops and disabled about 100,000.”According to Boyle, the U.S. government spent $100 billion on biological warfare programs since September 11, 2011, up until October 2015, which is no small sum. To put it into perspective, the U.S. spent $40 billion (assuming a constant dollar value) on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb. Boyle also estimates the U.S. has some 13,000 life scientists working within the biowarfare industry.“Clearly, the Reagan administration, under the influence of its neoconservatives who definitely believe in biological weapons and ethnic-specific biological weapons (you can see that in the PNAC report), were engaged in the use of DNA genetic engineering for the purpose of manufacturing biological weapons. That is why I gave a Congressional briefing in Washington, D.C. in 1985. I was asked to do that by the Council for Responsible Genetics that I work with, which involves the leading life scientists in the world from MIT and Harvard. I spent seven years at Harvard. I have three degrees and I knew all these people. They asked me to serve as their lawyer and give this Congressional briefing. I blew the whistle, and then they asked me to draft the implementing legislation, which I did …I want to make it clear I’m not here to speak in their name, I’m only speaking in my name, but if you look at my book, ‘Biological Warfare and Terrorism,’ professor Jonathan King wrote the foreword. So, I have the leading MIT professor of molecular biology supporting what I’m saying, if you don’t think I know enough science about it.”While there have so far only been a limited number of reported cases of COVID-19 infection in the U.S., the U.S. military has designated several detention sites around the country to quarantine Americans,8 should the situation take a turn for the worse.Historically speaking, however, government health officials have been vastly exaggerating the threat of pandemics in the U.S., including the bird flu, the swine flu, anthrax and Ebola.For example, as detailed in my 2009 New York Times bestseller “The Great Bird Flu Hoax,” then-President George Bush Jr. projected 2 million Americans would die from bird flu; the best-case scenario taking only 200,000 lives. The final death count in the U.S. from that pandemic was zero.It generated massive profits, though, as U.S. taxpayer dollars were used to purchase 20 million doses of Tamiflu. One of the people who was able to line his pockets from that hoax was defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld, who was president of Gilead Sciences when the drug was created.“[The bird flu] was another DNA, genetically engineered biological warfare weapon,” Boyle notes. “It was a chimera. It had three different elements in it and we were all lucky that somehow they attenuated the lethality and the infectiveness of the bird flu.”Whether or not COVID-19 will be similarly ineffective in its spread and lethality remains to be seen. Judging by the statistics in China, “it doesn’t look very good,” Boyle says.FOX: California Lab Says it Discovered Coronavirus Vaccine in 3 HoursAccording to Boyle, the COVID-19 virus is a chimera, like the avian flu virus before it. It includes SARS, an already weaponized coronavirus, along with HIV genetic material. “That was in a published article by Indian scientists. You could see the pictures right there, [but] political pressure was brought to bear upon them so they withdrew [the paper].”This is why some scientists are now looking into using HIV drugs to treat it,9 Boyle says. COVID-19 may also have a flu virus mixed in, along with gain of function properties that allow it to spread a greater distance than normal.Pandemics have also been used to chip away public freedoms. For example, the anthrax scare of 2001 was used as the impetus for signing the Patriot Act, which was the first step in taking away many of our personal freedoms and rolling out a complete surveillance state. To me, such outcomes are far more concerning than the risk of infection itself. Boyle adds:“They used Amerithrax to ram the Patriot Act through, that is correct … We became a police state … And as I pointed out in ‘Biowarfare and Terrorism,’ I think the same people who were behind the 9/11 terrorist attack were also behind the Amerithrax, but I’m just connecting dots there …What’s called Amerithrax came out of a U.S. government biological warfare weapons lab and program, and I publicly blew the whistle on that the first weekend of November 2001. The Council for Responsible Genetics was having its convention at Harvard Business School and I was chairing a panel with King and other experts on biological warfare, on U.S. biological warfare programs. As I was walking into the Harvard Divinity School, Fox TV had a camera crew there and I said, ‘Obviously, this came out a U.S. biological weapons program and probably Fort Detrick.’ I conducted the session and made the same comment. Then I made a comment to a Washington, D.C., radio station to that effect [and to] the BBC, so everyone in the world heard me. At that point, someone gave an order that I was never to be interviewed again by any mainstream news about biological warfare programs. And that’s been the case since the first week of November 2001.”As noted by Boyle, George Orwell’s book, “1984,” has become reality. Boyle has since lectured lawyers at DePaul Law School in Chicago about the totalitarian nature of the Patriot Act.“Snowden has correctly pointed out the federal government is spying on everything we say, all of our electronic communications, you name it,” Boyle says. “And again, the proof is I’ve been completely blackballed out of U.S. media. Indeed, if you go back and look at the Amerithrax attacks, they also hit mainstream U.S. media to make it clear to them that if they covered this issue they will be killed too.”As noted by Boyle, the U.S. government has a large stockpile of Amerithrax — a super weapons-grade nanotechnology anthrax with 1 trillion spores per gram — and that’s just the tip of the iceberg of the biological weapons developed. What’s more, Boyle has no doubt these weapons will eventually be put to use, as they have in the past. He says:“There was a tabletop exercise at John Hopkins University last fall … on coronavirus.10 Tabletop exercise, that’s a euphemism for a war game. Their estimate was that it killed 65 million people11 …John Hopkins is up to their eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare dirty work. They have a BSL-3 facility there … that they proudly announce on their website … They justify it by saying they’re developing vaccines. OK … How do they do that? They go out around the world, and this is a matter of public record, and scour for every type of hideous disease, fungus, virus and bacteria you can possibly imagine. They then bring it back to these BSL-4 labs and develop an offensive, biological agent using DNA genetic engineering and synthetic biology … set up by the Pentagon under DARPA …Once they have this offensive agent, they then proceed to develop a vaccine, because the agent is no good unless you can have a vaccine to protect your own people. So, they’re developing vaccines to have biological weapons, because a biological weapon consists of two elements: the offensive biological warfare agent in the first place, and then, second, a vaccine to protect your own people, and that is what is being done at all these BSL-4 facilities, and many of the BSL-3s as well. John Hopkins has a BSL-3 and they admit they do dual use. That’s what dual use means. They first develop the offensive biological warfare agent and then they develop the supposed vaccine.”Indeed, Johns Hopkins University is the biggest recipient of research grants from federal agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Department of Defense. It has also received millions of dollars in research grants from the Gates Foundation.12 In 2016, Johns Hopkins spent more than $2 billion on research projects, leading all U.S. universities in research spending for the 38th year in a row.13While it’s unclear exactly which treatment is the most effective, my guess is that Dr. Paul Marik’s intravenous vitamin C protocol for sepsis would be a good starting point, seeing how sepsis appears to be what kills those who succumb to a serious COVID-19 infection.Marik’s retrospective before-after clinical study14,15 showed that giving patients IV vitamin C with hydrocortisone and vitamin B1 for two days reduced mortality from 40% to 8.5%. The precise protocol used was 200 mg of thiamine every 12 hours, 1,500 mg of ascorbic acid every six hours, and 50 mg of hydrocortisone every six hours.16 Importantly, the treatment has no side effects and is inexpensive, readily available and simple to administer.According to Marik, vitamin C and corticosteroids have a synergistic effect,17 which is part of why his combo protocol is so effective. Still, simply using high-dose IV vitamin C exclusively has been shown to improve survival in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory failure, reducing mortality from 46% to 30%.18It also reduced the number of days they needed to remain hospitalized. On average, those who received vitamin C had by Day 28 spent three fewer days in the intensive care unit than the placebo group (seven days compared to 10). By Day 60, the treatment group had also spent seven fewer days in the hospital overall —15 days compared to 22.19While there are no trials that look at integrating hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), my suspicion is that this would provide a powerful synergy that could get the fatality rate from sepsis even closer to zero. Sadly, HBOT is not available at many hospitals, and even if it were, it is not approved for sepsis.You can learn more about Marik’s sepsis protocol in “Vitamin C — A Game Changer in Treatment of Deadly Sepsis,” along with commonsense recommendations for how to lower your risk of sepsis in the first place.You can also review Marik’s PowerPoint presentation, “Hydrocortisone, Ascorbic Acid and Thiamine for the Treatment of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock,” presented at the 2020 Critical Care Reviews meeting in Australia.

Bill Maher Drops Major Truth Bombs and Some Logic on this COVID-19 Pandemic,"Bill Maher drops some major truth bombs, and maybe an F bomb or two – so be warned – but I think everybody in the world needs to watch this video right now. ",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Newsweek: Contact-Tracing Apps Could Become Permanent Once the Pandemic Is Over,"Privacy advocacy groups are concerned that contact tracing measures initiated to combat coronavirus outbreaks could be used to track citizens beyond the pandemic.It comes as apps made to tackle COVID-19 outbreaks become required⁠ and even permanent in some areas.In China, Hangzhou plans to make permanent a mandatory app implemented due to COVID-19 crisis. Officials said this would produce a “firewall to enhance people’s health and immunity” following the pandemic.CBS: Oprah Gives 12M to Help Thousands of Latinx and Black Families with Contact Tracing, Wellness Visits and Special PackagesMeanwhile, India has made its contact tracing app mandatory for some workers. At the same time, it has also been compulsory for passengers on trains in the country.There have been suggestions the U.S. could require 100,000 workers on the ground to conduct tracing for exposure, to assist in stemming a second wave of the outbreak.Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert from ProPrivacy, an organization that advocates digital freedom, told Newsweek that the tactics being implemented in places like China could spread to other nations. He said:“We don’t want the threat of coronavirus or a future pandemic to threaten privacy.”As discussions continue about contact tracing measures, Walsh said he thinks the point at which tracing can stop needs to be firmly set, adding:“It’s going to be down to the government to say, society can go back to normal, or say we’re going to have to continue tracing to stop it from going back up.” Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeAccording to Walsh, if an exit from such surveillance isn’t determined, the continued use could have an impact on how people interact with one another, preventing an actual return to societal normality. Walsh said:“It’s led to comparisons to shows like Black Mirror. It may affect your social standing. It’s easy to see how that could affect the fabric of society as we know it.”The continued use of such apps would lessen the chance of moving around in the future without the prospect of the government knowing your whereabouts and even the company you keep, which could impact how people choose to conduct themselves and who they associate with, Walsh said.Another person expressing concern is Gus Hosein, executive director at Privacy International. He said he would be worried about what would happen to these apps when the pandemic is over, telling Newsweek:“It’s always been my concern when it comes to these apps, it’s not that they’re necessarily a bad idea, but what happens at the end of the pandemic? It’s definitely a concern.”Hosein said for the apps to be downloaded in high volume, those creating them “have to make the case that they are worthy of our trust.” He added:“They have to make sure the purpose is clear and never altered.”In Hosein’s opinion, the data collection should cease once the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the pandemic over. He said at that point, the information gathered should be deleted.Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19Omer Tene, chief knowledge officer at the International Association of Privacy Professionals, said that tracing apps should be built with privacy in mind from the outset. He discussed function creep, where the use of technology extends beyond its original purpose, adding: “Function creep is a well-known phenomenon when dealing with new technologies and institutions.For example, the surveillance infrastructure set up post 9/11 lingered for many years after the crisis was over and in some respects is still with us today.We need laws and regulations, such as the bills currently considered these days in Congress from both sides of the aisle, which would impose policy restrictions on these practices after the COVID-19 situation abates.”Tene said that while people can simply turn off the apps if they are optional, there should be legislation that requires all data collection to stop “once the public health emergency ends.”The U.S. does not have plans for a nationwide app, with states to make such decisions of their own accord. For example, Alabama, North Dakota, and South Carolina have said they will create apps using tech from Apple and Google to help conduct tracing. Called an application programming interface, these systems from Google and Apple will only be able to be used for COVID-19 response.President Trump has previously addressed some concerns over tracing technology, asserting people had “constitutional problems” with its use.It is not surprising the Centers for Disease Control describes it as “a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19.”In fact, WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said “countries must isolate, test, treat and trace” in order to control the pandemic. He stated in March:“Isolating, testing and treating every suspected case, and tracing every contact, must be the backbone of the response in every country.”These comments make it appear that many people across the globe will see contact tracing ramped up, though the parameters of the sort of measures some might face remains unclear, with this left to particular areas to decide.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Bill Gates – Most Dangerous Philanthropist in Modern History?,"While philanthropy is considered noble, some philanthropists appear to be doing far more harm than good with their donated millions. Bill Gates, who cofounded Microsoft in 1975, is perhaps one of the most dangerous philanthropists in modern history, having poured billions of dollars into global health initiatives that stand on shaky scientific and moral ground.Gates’ answers to the problems of the world are consistently focused on building corporate profits through highly toxic methods, be it chemical agriculture and GMOs, or pharmaceutical drugs and vaccines.1 Rarely, if ever, do we find Gates promoting clean living or inexpensive holistic health strategies.Bill Gates’ Philanthropy: 30,000 Indian girls used as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccineA March 17, 2020, article2 in The Nation titled, “Bill Gates’ Charity Paradox,” details “the moral hazards surrounding the Gates Foundation’s $50 billion charitable enterprise, whose sprawling activities over the last two decades have been subject to remarkably little government oversight or public scrutiny.”As noted in this article, Gates discovered an easy way to gain political power — “one that allows unelected billionaires to shape public policy” — namely charity. Gates has described his charity strategy as “catalytic philanthropy,” one in which the “tools of capitalism” are leveraged to benefit the poor.The only problem is that the true beneficiaries of Gates’ philanthropic endeavors tend to be those who are already rich beyond comprehension, including Gates’ own charitable foundation. The poor, on the other hand, end up with costly solutions like patented GMO seeds and vaccines that in some instances have done far more harm than good. (For a few examples, see the following references.3,4,5) The Nation reports:6“Through an investigation of more than 19,000 charitable grants the Gates Foundation has made over the last two decades, The Nation has uncovered close to $2 billion in tax-deductible charitable donations to private companies … which are tasked with developing new drugs, improving sanitation in the developing world, developing financial products for Muslim consumers, and spreading the good news about this work.The Gates Foundation even gave $2 million to Participant Media to promote Davis Guggenheim’s previous documentary film ‘Waiting for Superman,‘ which pushes one of the foundation’s signature charity efforts, charter schools — privately managed public schools. This charitable donation is a small part of the $250 million the foundation has given to media companies and other groups to influence the news.‘It’s been a quite unprecedented development, the amount that the Gates Foundation is gifting to corporations … I find that flabbergasting, frankly,’ says Linsey McGoey, a professor of sociology at the University of Essex and author of the book ‘No Such Thing as a Free Gift.’‘They’ve created one of the most problematic precedents in the history of foundation giving by essentially opening the door for corporations to see themselves as deserving charity claimants at a time when corporate profits are at an all-time high.'”Companies that have received large donations from the Gates Foundation include GlaxoSmithKline, Unilever, IBM, Vodafone, Scholastic Inc. and NBC Universal Media.7,8In the video above, Spiro Skouras reviews how the global COVID-19 pandemic is being used to snatch freedom and liberty away from us, and the role Gates is playing in the process.“We have been encouraged to sacrifice our liberty for a false sense of security, being conditioned more and more each day to rely on the state for protection and now many of us find ourselves relying on the state to pay our bills,” Skouras says.9“Some are beginning to see that there may be more to the official story than what we are led to believe. The very few may have seen this coming and are waiting for the next phase of what very well could be another step closer to global governance. The exact same individuals and government agencies, in addition to global institutions who stand to benefit the most, are the ones calling the shots.”Gates, surely, fits the description of someone who is both calling the shots and stands to gain handsomely from the COVID-19 pandemic. How? First, by investing in the same industries he’s giving charitable donations to and, second, by promoting a global public health agenda that benefits the companies he’s invested in and supports.For example, in 2014, a Mastercard affiliate, MasterCard Labs for Financial Inclusion, received a $19 million donation10,11 “to ‘increase usage of digital financial products by poor adults’ in Kenya,” The Nation reports, adding:12“The credit card giant had already articulated its keen business interest in cultivating new clients from the developing world’s 2.5 billion unbanked people, McGoey says, so why did it need a wealthy philanthropist to subsidize its work? And why are Bill and Melinda Gates getting a tax break for this donation?”Indeed, those are sensible questions that need serious review. The Mastercard donation also appears to have benefited the Gates Foundation, making an investigation into Gates’ “philanthropy” all the more necessary.As explained by The Nation, at the time of that donation, the Gates Foundation had “substantial financial investments in Mastercard through its holdings in Warren Buffett’s investment company, Berkshire Hathaway.”That’s not the only questionable donation on record. The Nation found “close to $250 million in charitable grants from the Gates Foundation to companies in which the foundation holds corporate stocks and bonds.” In other words, the Gates Foundation is giving money to companies that it owns stocks in and will benefit financially from.As a result, the Foundation and Gates himself continue to increase their wealth. Part of this growth in wealth also appears to be due to the tax breaks given for charitable donations. In short, it’s a perfect money-shuffling scheme that limits taxes while maximizing income generation.Companies that have received donations that in turn made money for the Gates Foundation include Merck, Novartis, GlaxoSmithKline, Vodafone, Sanofi, Ericsson, LG, Medtronic, Teva and “numerous startups,” The Nation writes, adding:“A foundation giving a charitable grant to a company that it partly owns — and stands to benefit from financially — would seem like an obvious conflict of interest …Tax scholars like Ray Madoff, a law professor at Boston College, indicate that multibillionaires see tax savings of at least 40 percent — which, for Bill Gates, would amount to $14 billion … Madoff, like many tax experts, stresses that these billions of dollars in tax savings have to be seen as a public subsidy — money that otherwise would have gone to the U.S. Treasury to help build bridges, do medical research, or close the funding gap at the IRS …If Bill and Melinda Gates don’t pay their full freight in taxes, the public has to make up the difference or simply live in a world where governments do less and less (educating, vaccinating, and researching) and superrich philanthropists do more and more.‘I think people often confuse what wealthy people are doing on their own dime and what [they’re] doing on our dime, and that’s one of the big problems about this debate,’ Madoff notes.‘People say, ‘It’s the rich person’s money [to spend as they wish].’ But when they get significant tax benefits, it’s also our money. And so that’s why we need to have rules about how they spend our money.'”If donating to for-profit companies sounds oddly illegal to you, you’d be right. Gates is a tax evader for doing so — he’s simply getting away with it. The nonprofit foundation is a disguise to avoid taxes while funding the research arms of for-profit organizations that his foundation is invested in.In reality, Bill and Melinda Gates should be given federal prison sentences, and while not directly spelled out, I believe that’s really the point of The Nation’s article. Using nonprofit money to advance research for companies you’re invested in is illegal.If you are as repulsed by the fact that Gates is getting away with this illegal behavior as much as I am, then I encourage you to contact the IRS Whistleblower Office and ask them to investigate Gates’ tax evasion. You can also file a consumer complaint with the Washington State Attorney General’s office.That Gates philanthropic endeavors protect his own investments can also be seen in his pro-patent stance. James Love, director of the nonprofit Knowledge Ecology International pointed out to The Nation that Gates:13“… uses his philanthropy to advance a pro-patent agenda on pharmaceutical drugs, even in countries that are really poor … He’s undermining a lot of things that are really necessary to make drugs affordable … He gives so much money to [fight] poverty, and yet he’s the biggest obstacle on a lot of reforms.”Gates is a staunch and longtime defender of the drug industry, and his intent to further the pharmaceutical agenda can clearly be seen in the current COVID-19 pandemic.As reported by Forbes,14 The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $100 million to fight the global COVID-19 outbreak. As much as $20 million will reportedly go to agencies such as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization to be used for front-line detection, containment and treatment efforts.Another $20 million is earmarked for at-risk populations in Africa and South Asia while the remaining $60 million is to be used for vaccine development, diagnostics and other treatments.Vaccines are clearly one of Gates’ mainstay “solutions” to most diseases. Gates has gone on record saying the U.S. needs disease surveillance and a national tracking system15 that could involve vaccine records embedded on our bodies (such as invisible ink quantum dot tattoos described in a Science Translational Medicine paper.16,17)In fact, he’s stated that life will not go back to normal until we have the ability to vaccinate the entire global population against COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has echoed this exact sentiment as well, as if they’re reading the same cue card.It would not surprise me if they were, seeing how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation collaborates with both the NIAID and WHO “to increase coordination across the international vaccine community and create a Global Vaccine Action Plan.”18Fauci is on Gate’s Leadership Council board charged with developing this vaccine action plan, as is WHO’s former director general Dr. Margaret Chan. As explained in a Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation press release:“The Global Vaccine Action Plan will enable greater coordination across all stakeholder groups — national governments, multilateral organizations, civil society, the private sector and philanthropic organizations — and will identify critical policy, resource, and other gaps that must be addressed to realize the life-saving potential of vaccines.”Gates influence over global health policies has been criticized for years, yet nothing has been done to limit it. If anything, his power has only grown, and warnings that his corporate interests may undermine public health policy now appears to have come true. As reported by Politico in 2017:19“Some billionaires are satisfied with buying themselves an island. Bill Gates got a United Nations health agency in Geneva. Over the past decade, the world’s richest man has become the World Health Organization’s second biggest donor, second only to the United States and just above the United Kingdom …The Gates Foundation has pumped more than $2.4 billion into the WHO since 2000 … This largesse gives him outsized influence over its agenda … The result, say his critics, is that Gates’ priorities have become the WHO’s …Some health advocates fear that because the Gates Foundation’s money comes from investments in big business, it could serve as a Trojan horse for corporate interests to undermine WHO’s role in setting standards and shaping health policies.”According to statements made by Gates, societal and financial normalcy may never return to those who refuse vaccination, as the digital vaccination certificate Gates is pushing for might ultimately be required to go about your day-to-day life and business.An April 4, 2020, article by OffGuardian comments on Gates’ March 24, 2020, interview with Chris Anderson, the curator of TED (which runs TED Talks) above:20“Shockingly, Gates … suggests people be made to have a digital ID showing their vaccination status, and that people without this ‘digital immunity proof’ would not be allowed to travel. Such an approach would mean very big money for vaccine producers.”Again, vaccine producers stand to make enormous amounts of money from any given pandemic, and the Gates Foundation is both funding and making investment profits from vaccine makers. Is it any wonder then that Gates is trying to indoctrinate people into thinking there are no other answers? When asked by Anderson about the economic ramifications of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates says:“It is really tragic that the economic effects of this are very dramatic … But … bringing the economy back … that’s more of a reversible thing than bringing people back to life. So, we’re going to take the pain in the economic dimension, huge pain, in order to minimize the pain in disease and death dimension.”As noted by OffGuardian, Gates’ statement:21“… goes directly against the imperative to balance the benefits and costs of the screening, testing and treatment measures for each ailment — as successfully promulgated for years by, for example, the Choosing Wisely campaign — to provide the maximum benefit to individual patients and society as a whole. Even more importantly … there may be dramatically more deaths from the economic breakdown than from COVID-19 itself …Millions could potentially die from suicide, drug abuse, lack of medical coverage or treatment, poverty and lack of food access, on top of other predictable social, medical and public-health problems stemming from the response to COVID-19.”30 Million Dead: Bill Gates Sees a Genetically Engineered Bioweapon Triggering the Next Global PandemicAt 33:45 in the interview, Gates goes on to reveal what appears to be a stunning insider’s insight into the current economic shutdown:“We don’t want to have a lot of recovered people … To be clear, we’re trying — through the shut-down in the United States — to not get to 1% of the population infected … I believe we will be able to avoid that with having this economic pain.”In other words, if we are to believe Gates, we’re sacrificing the financial stability and sanity of hundreds of millions of Americans in order to prevent the infection rate from hitting 1% of the population.Keep in mind, the death rate for COVID-19 now appears to be on par with seasonal influenza, according to Fauci,22 so the vast majority of those infected end up recovering after mild illness, and have antibodies that should provide them with long-lasting immunity. Clearly, if you want to make money from a vaccine, you don’t want people to develop immunity naturally, and this is precisely what Gates is admitting to. As noted by OffGuardian:23“Gates and his colleagues far prefer to create a vast, hugely expensive, new system of manufacturing and selling billions of test kits, and in parallel very quickly developing and selling billions of antivirals and vaccines. And then, when the virus comes back again a few months later and most of the population is unexposed and therefore vulnerable, selling billions more test kits and medical interventions.”The short video above summarizes some of the points I’ve touched on in this article so far and reviews how the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation influences public health policy at the very highest levels through a vast web of personal and organizational interconnections.Gates has a history of “predicting” global pandemics with vast numbers of deaths,24 and with his call for a tracking system to keep tabs on infected/noninfected and vaccinated/unvaccinated individuals, he’s ensuring an unimaginably profitable future for the vaccine makers he supports and makes money from via his Foundation investments.In an April 9, 2020, Children’s Health Defense article,25 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. further details Gates’ vaccine agenda. As noted by Kennedy:“Vaccines, for Bill Gates, are a strategic philanthropy that feed his many vaccine-related businesses (including Microsoft’s ambition to control a global vaccination ID enterprise26) and give him dictatorial control of global health policy.”The vaccination ID enterprise Kennedy mentions refers to a program called ID2020, launched in 2019, which is designed to “leverage immunization as an opportunity to establish digital identity.”27This digital identity system is said to carry “far-reaching implications for individuals’ access to services and livelihoods,” so to think that Gates’ call for implantable COVID-19 vaccine certificates would be limited to that alone would likely be a grave mistake.It’s not so far-fetched to imagine a future in which your vaccine certificate simply replaces personal identifications such as your driver’s license, state ID card, Social Security card and passport.As people are starting to see the truth, Gates’ social media accounts have been flooded with criticism, resulting in The Wall Street Journal publishing an article28 trying to raise pity for him, saying he’s being attacked by “social media mobs.” April 17, 2020, Zero Hedge commented on the PR campaign to protect Gates:29“The Wall Street Journal’s Deepa Seetharaman wants us to know that while poor billionaire Bill Gates has ‘long been a target for online trolls’ … ‘the social-media attacks have intensified’ as the Micrrosoft co-founder and World Health Organization (WHO) benefactor has become the left’s de-facto coronavirus czar … Perhaps the ‘conspiracy theorists’ are having a little trouble digesting the fact that Gates — whose vaccine efforts in India were blamed for a devastating non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP) epidemic that paralyzed 490,000 children — coincidentally hosted an October, 2019 high-level ‘pandemic simulation’ in New York called Event 201 which specifically focused on coronavirus … Combine that with Gates’ recent comments about mass vaccination and biometric identification in order to ‘open up’ the country and allow people to attend mass gatherings — an idea which Dr. Anthony Fauci said ‘has merit,’ and so-called conspiracy theorists have plenty of dots to connect.According to the Journal, ‘social-media platforms remain fertile ground for virus-related conspiracies and online harassment, despite repeated pledges by the companies to crack down on such activity.’ So — Gates is being harassed and nobody is stopping these thought criminals with their menacing opinions. And of course, ‘bots’ are also being blamed for amplifying ‘conspiracy claims’ — since there can’t be that many real humans with bad things to say about Mr. Gates.”Far from being a force for good, Gates appears to have chosen to use his wealth and intellect to further a distasteful social control plan to benefit his own nefarious agendas, and people all over the world are finally starting to see his true colors.*Article originally appeared at Mercola.

FOX: California Biopharmaceutical Company Claims Coronavirus Antibody Breakthrough,"A California-based biopharmaceutical company claims to have discovered an antibody that could shield the human body from the coronavirus and flush it out of a person’s system within four days, Fox News has exclusively learned.Later Friday, Sorrento Therapeutics will announce their discovery of the STI-1499 antibody, which the San Diego company said can provide “100% inhibition” of COVID-19, adding that a treatment could be available months before a vaccine hits the market.“We want to emphasize there is a cure. There is a solution that works 100 percent,” Dr. Henry Ji, founder and CEO of Sorrento Therapeutics, told Fox News. “If we have the neutralizing antibody in your body, you don’t need the social distancing. You can open up a society without fear.”The health care and pharmaceutical industries have been scrambling to develop viable vaccines and antibody treatments as the number of COVID-19-related deaths is expected to hit 100,000 by June 1.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeMany medical researchers are scrambling to find antibodies, optimistic that they could provide a remedy or preventative care in less time than it would take to develop a vaccine. Antibody treatments have been used for the past 100 years as a means to stave off infections, but their effectiveness has had mixed results. Finding a successful antibody or convalescent plasma treatment for COVID-19 could present challenges.“Doctors are taking blood plasma from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 and infusing it into those who are critically ill. The plasma is laden with antibodies, and the approach shows some promise,” former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed. “The constraint: There isn’t enough plasma from recovered patients to go around.”Some medical experts believe that while antibody research shows promise, there are concerns for how long the effects may last in fighting the virus in an infected patient.“Antibodies, in general, have been very effective at bringing virus [levels] down if you’ve had a high burden of infection,” Phyllis Kanki, a professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said in a recent interview. “There are limitations to how much you can give and for how long.”New York Times: CDC Labs Were Contaminated, Delaying US Coronavirus Testing, Officials SayOfficials for Sorrento Therapeutics believe they have found the key to a successful treatment.Through their studies, Sorrento screened and tested billions of antibodies they have collected over the past decade. They say this made it possible to identify hundreds of potential antibody candidates that could successfully bind themselves to the spike proteins of the coronavirus. They found that a dozen of these antibodies demonstrated the ability to block the spike proteins from attaching itself to the human enzyme ACE2, which is the receptor a virus normally uses to enter human cells.Dogs’ Rights Now Exceed Human RightsThrough further testing, the researchers at Sorrento found that there was one particular antibody that showed to be 100 percent effective in blocking COVID-19 from infecting health cells — STI-1499. Dr. Ji added:“When the antibody prevents a virus from entering a human cell, the virus cannot survive. If they cannot get into the cell, they cannot replicate. So it means that if we prevent the virus from getting the cell, the virus eventually dies out. The body clears out that virus.”“This puts its arms around the virus. It wraps around the virus and moves them out of the body.”Dr. Ji pointed out that the antibody can be used as preventative therapy since there are no side effects, and that it can be more effective than any vaccine that may be developed, saying:“This is the best solution. The point of making a vaccine is to generalize a neutralizing antibody. So, if you already have one, you don’t need to the body to generate one from a vaccine. You’ve already provided it. You’re cutting out the middleman.”It was recently announced Sorrento had partnered with New York-based health care system Mount Sinai to develop an antibody cocktail. Dubbed Covi-Shield, the cocktail will be comprised of three different antibodies and, pending FDA approval, will be used as a prophylactic treatment for people returning to work and those who have been exposed to COVID-19.The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom” by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna TachoverSorrento officials said that STI-1499 will likely be the first antibody in the cocktail. They are also looking to develop the antibody as a stand-alone therapy due to its high potency, according to a statement provided to Fox News.They said that they can provide up to 200,000 doses per month and are looking to produce tens of millions more to meet projected demands.Dr. Mark Brunswick, senior vice president of Sorrento, said that developing antibody treatments may be more effective in quickly combating the coronavirus. While a vaccine treatment can take up to 18 months, effective anti-body treatment can become available in much less time and with a much higher success rate. He points out, however, that a quick approval from the Food and Drug Administration would be needed to make the antibody treatment available within months, telling Fox News:“As soon as it is infused, that patient is now immune to the disease. For the length of time, the antibody is in that system. So, if we were approved [by the FDA] today, everyone who gets that antibody can go back to work and have no fear of catching COVID-19.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
The Guardian: W.H.O. to Resume Hydroxychloroquine Trial After Earlier Halt Over Safety Concerns,"The World Health Organization will resume clinical trials of hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug that researchers hope to use to treat Covid-19, after temporarily halting research over safety concerns raised last month by a study published in a major medical journal.Scientists around the world raised serious questions about the study. They highlighted discrepancies and issues concerning how the study collected data from 96,000 patients across hundreds of hospitals. However, major hospitals denied a connection with the database, which is managed by a company called Surgisphere. Dr Sapan Desai, the chief executive of the company, is also co-author of the paper.The document, published in the Lancet, said hydroxychloroquine was associated with higher mortality rates and heart problems in Covid-19 patients in hospitals around the world. The finding prompted Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, to announce the hydroxychloroquine arm of its Solidarity global clinical trial would halt while the study and other findings were reviewed.Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsThe Lancet published an expression of concern about the paper on Wednesday. The co-authors of the study who were not from Surgisphere had appointed an independent audit into the data’s provenance and integrity. A Lancet spokeswoman said:“All research articles published in the Lancet journals undergo independent, external peer review, including statistical review.”On Thursday, a Guardian investigation revealed severe flaws in the database and raised questions about Desai’s claims regarding how the drug works. On Twitter, Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, described it as “an important investigation.”On Friday, Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the W.H.O. had reviewed the Lancet study and other findings about hydroxychloroquine and had concluded it was safe for its trials to resume. He said:“The executive group received this recommendation and endorsed the continuation of all arms of Solidarity trial including hydroxychloroquine.”NEWSWEEK: Doubts over Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine After Animals Tested Catch VirusThe W.H.O. emphasized there is still no indication hydroxychloroquine, or any drug, is effective in treating or preventing Covid-19. Infectious diseases experts have repeatedly noted the need for careful studies before making treatment decisions.Hydroxychloroquine trials worldwide were suspended due to the Lancet paper, including the Australasian Covid-19 trial (Ascot) trial. On Thursday, associate professor Steven Tong, the Ascot principal investigator, said the governance committees for the trial recommended that it now proceed. He said:“The trial steering committee for Ascot strongly supports the ongoing need for data from randomised clinical trials in order to clarify the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine in patients hospitalised with Covid-19.Randomised controlled trials are considered the ‘gold standard’ when it comes to testing treatments in humans as they remove any bias, therefore providing the robust evidence that’s required to make safe and informed decisions about the ongoing use of a treatment.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CNN: Nursing Home Worker Deaths Going Unscrutinized by Federal Government,"Safety regulators are ignoring deaths as nursing home employees continue to die of Covid-19. Many are worried OSHA isn’t listening to health care workers who believe their lives are in danger. Victor Sison, who loved caring for the elderly and went out of his way to spend time with residents who didn’t get visitors, had complained to his family about a lack of essential protective gear such as gowns and masks. As the coronavirus crisis worsened, Sison volunteered to come in on his days off to fill in for others who had called out sick.Less than a month before he died of Covid-19, Victor Sison posted photos of himself at the New Jersey nursing home where he had worked for many years. He was wrapped in what looked like trash bags. He wrote in early April:“LORD HELP ALL MY FELLOW FRONTLINERS.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeBut shortly after posting the photo of himself, Sison became sick. The 64-year-old died on April 18, just a year before he planned to retire. Due to Covid-19, his family wasn’t allowed to visit him in the hospital. A hospital worker held the phone over Sison’s bed as his family said their goodbyes over FaceTime.OSHA did not send inspectors to Complete Care at Hamilton Plaza in New Jersey to find out what happened to Sison or his two colleagues or determine whether working conditions at the 120-bed nursing home were safe, according to agency data.Following inquiries from CNN about Sison, however, OSHA said this week it has launched an investigation into a death at the facility “to determine the proper course of action.”That means OSHA and state worker safety programs approved by the agency have only physically investigated a fraction of nursing home employee deaths.Even when deaths or imminent dangers are reported to OSHA, and federal or state regulators launch an investigation, the agency has taken little action to improve working conditions for other employees or hold employers accountable. Therefore countless workers around the country exposed to unsafe working conditions, according to a CNN analysis.CBS: Michigan Governor’s Executive Order: Wear a Mask or Face $500 FineHad OSHA officials looked at the state’s data on nursing home deaths, they would have seen that a single nursing home chain there, Alaris Health, had reported more than 500 employee cases of Covid-19 among its 16 facilities.In a statement to CNN about its oversight of the nursing home industry during the pandemic, OSHA said the agency has the tools it needs to police workplaces through existing regulations and has been providing “robust guidance for employers and employees.”The American Health Care Association, a trade organization representing long-term care facilities, said that the prolonged incubation of the virus makes it difficult to determine whether fatalities are “work related” and therefore required to be reported to OSHA.While the AHCA said cases among healthcare workers could be attributable to community spread, it said facilities might want to “err on the side of over-reporting to OSHA.”Even though he acknowledged the facility had an outbreak, with state data showing a total of fifty-nine Covid-19 cases and eleven deaths, the facility spokesman said, referring to Sison, it was “unclear whether this staff member was infected at the facility.” Really? After the CNN inquiry, the facility did report the death to OSHA.Nursing home forced employee to get a flu shot despite her religious objections, DOJ suit saysUntil this week, the federal agency had only cited one nursing home for a violation related to Covid-19 — levying a roughly $6,500 penalty on a Georgia facility accused of failing to report worker hospitalizations on time. Critics said the punishment would do little to discourage bad behavior or serve as a warning to other facilities.That was the case at St. Albans Community Living Center, a New York veterans home where Mavis Charles-France had worked for ten years before dying of coronavirus in May. Worried that the facility was not prepared for coronavirus to strike, Charles-France’s coworker and fellow nurse Geddes Scott said he contacted OSHA in April, about a month before Charles-France’s death.A spokesman for the VA New York Harbor Healthcare System said:(it is) “mourning the recent loss of a longtime employee who passed away from COVID-19 complications,” but disputed Scott’s concerns, saying that the facility has always provided workers with adequate PPE and that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance was being followed to protect all employees, adding that “complaints are not facts, they are merely allegations. “Winston France, Charles-France’s husband, said they also had plans to travel in retirement. He remembered his wife being concerned about her safety at work and explicitly complaining about people entering her office without proper PPE. He said:“A lot of people say why didn’t she just take off? She cared about her job so much … Mavis wanted to be a nurse and she died. She died being a nurse.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
USA Today: Woman Gives Birth on the Sidewalk After Finding All the Hospital Doors Locked,"A Kentucky woman gave birth steps away from a hospital entrance assisted by her husband, who tied off the umbilical cord with a protective face mask.Sarah Rose Patrick felt initial labor pangs on May 8, but her doctor told her she was not yet in labor. Early the next morning, she woke up with painful contractions. But when they arrived at Baptist Health Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, the sliding doors to the hospital’s Labor and Delivery Department were locked, according to Patrick.But her baby couldn’t wait. With the help of a 911 dispatcher, her husband, David, helped bring their third child, Navi Bond Patrick, into the world. Patrick said:“You’re delivering your baby in the cold night air, on the street, in Covid-19. It’s the last thing you want.”2The final step required tying off the baby’s umbilical cord. But they had no shoelaces or ties. So, David improvised, using his wife’s hand-sewn protective face mask.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeLA TIMES: The Government May Start Tracking Your Poop to Find People With COVID-19After Navi was safely delivered, hospital staff arrived and took them inside.David added that the Baptist Health nurses and doctors were “wonderful” and that they had no hard feelings after the locked door fiasco.The hospital’s security director apologized to the couple for their unfortunate ordeal outside in the cold and explained how Baptist would take lessons from their experience to help improve in the future, David said.Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsThe hospital said the entrance the Patricks’ tried to use is meant to always be open. The hospital told CNN in a statement:“Patients who come to Baptist Health Louisville, who are pregnant and in labor, can always enter the hospital in the middle of the night through the Emergency Room or enter through the entrance to the Labor and Delivery department which is located in the front of the building at 3900 Kresge Way. Both entrances have signage and both entrances are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Other entrances to the hospital are closed after 7 p.m. until 5 a.m.”2For Patrick, giving birth to a healthy baby despite “terrifying” circumstances makes her grateful. She added:“These are such scary times, with so much fear everywhere and so much danger, but for me having that, it gives me peace.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: Michigan Governor’s Executive Order: Wear a Mask or Face $500 Fine,"Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed an executive order that makes face masks mandatory for most people in indoor public spaces and crowded outdoor spaces. It requires businesses to refuse entry to people who do not wear masks. There are limited exceptions.Exemptions to the mask order include those who have a medical condition that bars them from wearing a mask, people who are eating or drinking while seated in a restaurant, and kids younger than 5-years-old.Harvard Says Couples Should Wear Masks While Having SexA willful violation of the order is a misdemeanor subject to a $500 criminal penalty, according to the governor.The following release was issued by the governor’s office on Friday morning:LANSING, Mich. — Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed executive order 2020-147, which reiterates that individuals are required to wear a face covering whenever they are in an indoor public space. It also requires the use of face coverings in crowded outdoor spaces. Most significantly, the order requires any business that is open to the public to refuse entry or service to people who refuse to wear a face covering, with limited exceptions. Governors in the states of Kansas, Maine, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Washington have imposed similar requirements on businesses.Governor Whitmer signed this executive order in response to rising COVID-19 cases in Michigan and across the country. Executive Order 2020-147 amends and replaces the governor’s previous Executive Order 2020-114.“The heroes on the front lines of this crisis have gone hours without taking their masks off every day – doctors, nurses, child care workers, grocery store workers. We owe it to them to wear our masks when we’re on a trip to the grocery store or pharmacy,” said Governor Whitmer. “Masks can reduce the chance of spreading COVID-19 by about 70 percent. By wearing masks, we can save lives and protect our family, friends, and neighbors from the spread of COVID-19. And by wearing masks now, we can put our state in a stronger position so our kids can return to school safely in the fall. For the sake of your loved ones, let’s all mask up, Michigan.”Over the past week, every region in Michigan has seen an uptick in new cases, and daily case counts now exceed 20 cases per million in the Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Lansing regions. Research confirms that a big part of the reason is spotty compliance with the governor’s requirement, issued in prior orders, that individuals wear face coverings in public spaces.Studies have shown that wearing a mask can save lives and significantly lover an individual’s chance of spreading COVID-19. A study on different regions in Germany, for example, suggests that the adoption of mandatory mask ordinances decreased the daily growth rate of COVID-19 infections by 40%. Modeling from the University of Washington similarly indicates that more than 40,000 lives would be spared nationwide if 95% of the population wore a mask while in public. Furthermore, a study conducted by Goldman Sachs concluded that a federal mask mandate could save the U.S. economy from taking a 5% hit to our GDP.“Michigan’s fight against COVID-19 is nowhere near over, which is why it’s so important that we all do our part and wear masks when we’re out in public,” said Chief Medical Executive and DHHS Chief Deputy for Health Dr. Joneigh Khaldun. “Wearing a mask or face covering can significantly decrease the chance of spreading COVID-19 and save lives. It’s important that all Michiganders wear masks properly – not down around the neck, not only over the mouth, but correctly over the mouth and nose. Please everyone stay patient, and remain vigilant.”Under the governor’s order, businesses that are open to the public must refuse entry and service to individuals who fail to comply, and must post signs at all entrances instructing customers of their legal obligation to wear a face covering while inside. Those who are exempt from wearing a mask in Michigan businesses include people younger than five years old, those who cannot medically tolerate a face covering, and those who are eating or drinking while seated at a food service establishment.The executive order takes effect at 12:01am on Monday, July 13. A willful violation of the order is a misdemeanor subject to a $500 criminal penalty, but no term of confinement may be imposed on individuals who violate the mask requirement. No individual is subject to penalty under the order for removing a mask while engaging in religious worship at a house of religious worship, although consistent with guidance from the CDC, congregants are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings during religious services.To view Executive Order 2020-147, click the link below:EO 2020-147 Emerg order – Masks.pdf",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Smithsonian: The Race for a Coronavirus Vaccine Runs on Horseshoe Crab Blood,"Horseshoe crabs have been living peacefully in and around shallow coastal waters on soft sandy or muddy bottoms for 450 million years and are considered living fossils. Sadly, their blue blood is used in medicine to ensure that anything that gets injected or implanted into the human body is free of potentially life-threatening bacterial contamination. Now, their blood is being used in the development of a vaccine for COVID-19. The Smithsonian reported:A special compound in the crab’s blood (called LAL) quickly clots in the presence of endotoxins, microbial byproducts that can be harmful, supplying a perfect natural test for purity. In the race to find a COVID-19 vaccine, horseshoe crab blood is very important.Harvesting the blood of these creatures kills an estimated 50,000 arthropods a year. They are also threatened by overfishing, rising sea levels and pollution.The Chilling Image Behind Every Vaccine You’ve Ever Had….Every year, scores of steel needles are stuck into the crab’s body to take its blood. In 2018, the blood harvest in the U.S. drained a third of the essential fluids from approximately 500,000 crabs. Each crab gets released back to where it was caught after its blood is taken, but thousands of them die in the process.  Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeInstead of using the anthropod’s blood, animal rights groups, conservationists, and others would like to see the development and approval of synthetic alternatives to the milky-blue crab blood. But, because of application and testing hurdles, it doesn’t look promising. Nonetheless, conservative groups estimate switching to a synthetic alternative could save at least 100,000 crabs each year. The Smithsonian reported:An influential United States group has abandoned plans to list a synthetic alternative, called recombinant Factor C (rFC), alongside the tried and true blue fluid, reports by John Miller for Reuters. The move by medical standards group U.S. Pharmacopeia (USP) would have given rFC equal standing with crab blood, which has long been the industry standard for testing, per Reuters.The gist of the USP’s rationale is that rFC requires more testing, and that the current crab-derived test has a 30-year track record of safe and effective use, reports the Times. Many expected the alternative test to be approved for widespread use as it was in Europe by the European Pharmacopeia, per the Times.NEWSWEEK: Doubts over Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine After Animals Tested Catch VirusThere is one pharmaceutical company that claims it is sparing the helmet shaped creature and is using rFC in its COVID-19 antibody testing. The Smithsonian reported:Eli Lilly recently announced it had started testing a COVID-19 antibody in humans with nothing but rFC for purity testing, Jay Bolden, a biologist with the company, tells Reuters. Bolden tells the Times his company made the switch because of the synthetic product’s consistent quality, its reduced costs, lack of reliance on an animal population as well as the company’s desire to avoid harming animals where possible.More than 40,000 samples tested by Eli Lilly using rFC suggested it was just as good as LAL, Bolden tells Reuters. “And that data is out there, and it’s either not being looked at or it’s being ignored… There’s no reason the USP should be asking for more data.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
NYT: Our Cash-Free Future Is Getting Closer,"The global pandemic is propelling a shift toward a cashless society in ways that no other single event has. Many experts say that’s not necessarily a good thing.But in the coronavirus era, cash is not the preferred method of payment, as social distancing requirements and concerns over hygiene prompt many people to pay with plastic because they don’t want to have to touch anything.Cash was already being edged out in many countries as consumers paid more frequently with apps and cards for even the smallest purchases. But the coronavirus is hastening a shift toward a cashless future, raising new calculations for merchants and enhancing the digital payments industry. Not to mention paving the way for ID2020Rampant fears over spreading the disease have coerced consumers to rethink how they shop and pay. Retailers and restaurants are promoting clicks over cash to lessen exposure for employees. China’s central bank sterilized banknotes in regions affected by the virus. And governments from India to Kenya to Sweden along with the United Nations, are promoting cashless payments in the name of public health.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeValdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission vice-president for financial services, wrote on Twitter as Europe imposed quarantines.“Time to swap your coins for payment cards — safer for containing coronavirus.”Even still, cash is absolutely not dead, thankfully. In Europe, before the pandemic, coins and bills accounted for 80 percent of the transactions. And there are few indications that the pandemic is about to wipe it out.Yet for an increasing number of people affected by Covid-19 quarantines, cash is not their payment choice. Morten Jorgensen, director of RBR, based in London, a consulting firm specializing in banking technology, cards and payments, said:We’re living through an amazing global social experiment that is forcing governments, businesses and consumers to rethink their operating models and norms for social interactions.We have a world in which there is less contact. People’s habits are changing as we speak.Credit card companies, banks, and digital platforms are quick to capitalize on the crisis to advance the cashless revolution by encouraging consumers and retailers to use cards and smartphone apps that generate lucrative fees. In Britain alone, retailers about $1.7 billion in third-party fees in 2018, up over $88 million from the year before, according to the British Retail Consortium.BREAKING: Business Insider: Bolivia Senate Approves MMS as a Treatment for COVID-19Payment and processing companies such as PayPal (whose stock is up about 55 percent this year) and Adyen, based in the Netherlands (up 72 percent), are also poised to profit significantly from a digital marketplace. So do data analytics and fraud prevention companies, and businesses that enable merchants to accept card payments.A surge in online shopping is fueling the trend, as quarantined consumers shift to digital tools for essential items. In April, in the United States, 40 million customers went online for groceries. In Italy, where cash is king, the volume of e-commerce transactions has surged more than 80 percent.CLICK THE PICTURE ABOVE TO SIGN THE PETITION AGAINST A CASHLESS FUTURECredit card issuers are maintaining the momentum by working with banks and governments to lift ceilings on so-called contactless payments that allow shoppers to avoid touching a keypad.Visa reported a surge in contactless payments for necessary items in Britain after its limits were lifted, and the United States saw a 100 percent increase from a year ago. Visa said it had also worked with governments in Greece, Ireland, Malta, Poland, and Turkey to raise contactless payment limits.Wisconsin Workers Embedded With MicrochipsCard companies don’t disclose fee earnings, but Mr. Jorgensen at RBR said issuers were presumably clearing a handsome profit.Despite the fact there is no medical evidence that cash transmits the virus, in a recent study, the Bank for International Settlements commented on the effect of Covid-19 on cash use, saying:“perceptions that cash could spread pathogens may change payment behavior by users and firms.”The British company Tappit is among those hoping to profit from the discomfort associated with using cash. The company provides data gathering and cashless solutions such as wristbands and apps connected to a credit card for use at festivals, sporting matches, and other large groups. Their sales pitch, honed during the pandemic, promotes “No more dirty cash.” The chief executive, Jason Thomas, said Tappit has seen a surge in interest by hotels, restaurants, and sporting arenas hoping to quickly revive business after lockdowns. Thomas noted that cashless technology allows lines to move faster and encourages more spending, adding:“Some partners who were slightly fearful of going cashless have now decided this is an opportunity to do so.“The pandemic has kind of ripped the Band-Aid off of going cashless.”Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19The officials that manage the world’s currencies say the dangers of going entirely cashless are extensive. In tech-forward Sweden, cash has been disappearing so fast that Parliament and the central bank asked commercial banks to keep bills and coins circulating while they figure out what a cash-free future would mean.Central banks are studying whether electronic currencies can replace physical cash. The Swedish Riksbank is testing a pilot version of a digital krona, or e-krona, that could retain the functions of a currency backed by the state. John Velissarios of Accenture, is helping to manage the Riksbank’s test, said:“In certain economies, there is still a role for cash, because it continues to provide a benefit and a utility. That’s where the concept of things like digital central bank money is interesting.”While the reality of going completely cashless is still a ways off, the shift in attitudes toward real cash brought on by the pandemic is here to stay. Mr Jorgenson added:“Cash is not going to disappear. But it will continue to decline, and Covid is accelerating that trend.”P.S.

What We Can Learn From a Pandemic “Tabletop Exercise”,"By Mary Holland, CHD General Counsel and Vice ChairWe are living in unfamiliar times. We are frightened by the highly infectious coronavirus CoV-2019 or COVID-19, and our hearts go out to those who have been directly affected. We are in a global “lockdown,” “sheltering in place,” against an invisible but potentially deadly enemy. Our world has changed rapidly and dramatically since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020.Most of us are still in a kind of shock usually limited to wartime. It remains hard to believe that countries around the world are ordering businesses and schools to shut down, citizens to stay home, and pausing all communal life to preserve the public health. We have moved to a world of physical isolation and only virtual connection to friends and community. The world’s economy is on the brink of a depression to avert the worst-case public health scenario.Although most of us have been caught by surprise, some in business and government circles have been preparing for just such a pandemic for a long time. On October 18, 2019, the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the World Economic Forum, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation together convened a group of fifteen participants from leading industries and global institutions to participate in a fictional pandemic exercise entitled “Event 201.” This invitation-only “tabletop exercise,” a term typically used for wargames, occurred at the Hotel Pierre in New York City.After the day-long exercise, the consortium produced several high quality videos of their deliberations. “Event 201” has six segments: an 11-minute “highlights” video and five additional segments of about an hour each on 1: Countermeasures, 2: Trade and Travel, 3: Finance, 4: Communications, and 5: Hotwash and Conclusion.Netflix Viewers Freaked Out as ‘Pandemic’ Documentary Happens to Drop Amid Coronavirus OutbreakKey participants at the table were representatives of the Johns Hopkins Center, the Gates Foundation and the World Economic Forum, which were the institutions sponsoring the exercise. The corporate and government participants’ names and affiliations are below. (Governments also conduct their own simulation exercises; the press recently reported on a Trump Administration drill called “Crimson Contagion.”)Missing from Event 201 were legislators; representatives of small and medium-sized businesses; labor; social media; religious leaders; and civil society unaffiliated with intergovernmental and corporate organizations. In short, the participants were a heavyweight group of corporate executives, policymakers, and health officials. Left out were representatives from many sectors likely to be hardest hit by such a scenario.The participants included:Coincidentally, the participants addressed a simulated global pandemic from a coronavirus that initially showed up in bats, then pigs, and finally  jumped to humans before spreading rapidly around the world despite the players’ best efforts. The simulation imagined no available vaccine. In the background, rhythmic music pulsated in a minor key.The pandemic scenario had the following parameters:The scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.The organizers pulled vignettes from the five plus hours for the “Highlights” below.Travel BansThe participants first address travel advisories and bans as they learn that travel industry revenues have dropped 45%. The World Bank Group representative explains that to rely on the United Nations in such a situation would be “delusional.” The world must turn to the private sector for “efficient leadership.” The Gates Foundation representative notes that only the private sector has the knowledge to negotiate the complex supply chain issues, underscoring the need for a “new kind of public-private collaboration.”Economic CollapseThe participants learn from a news report that the stock market has fallen 20-40%. The discussants wonder if there are institutions that they “cannot allow to fail.” They see governments as the best source of financing and discuss tax breaks and subsidies to “escalate entrepreneurship.” The U.S. CDC representative adds that “it’s really a war footing we need to be on.”The banker also questions whether there might be a technological answer to the problem, perhaps implying online censorship.Pandemic ‘could wipe out 900 million people,’ experts warnDisinformation and MisinformationNext, the participants tackle the question of intentional “disinformation” and accidental “misinformation.” They note that “limited internet shutdowns are being implemented to quell panic.” They worry that “misinformation is undercutting efforts to control the panic.” The representative from Edelman, a global PR behemoth, notes that social media companies must now step up as “broadcasters” and no longer just see themselves as technology platforms. They must “counteract, if not flood the zone” with accurate information based on partnering with “the scientific and health communities.” The representative of the Monetary Authority of Singapore wonders whether governments might not step up their enforcement actions against “fake news.”By contrast, the private sector banker at the table remarks that it is “neither practical nor desirable” to shut down information, but agrees that the “flood strategy” is promising, capitalizing on “trusted sources of information.” The banker also questions whether there might be a technological answer to the problem, perhaps implying online censorship.Effects of the PandemicIn the video epilogue, the narrator states that 65 million people died in the first 18 months. While the numbers at first seemed controllable, the disease spread to densely populated, impoverished megacities where the death toll exploded. Within six months, cases occurred in nearly every country, and the “global economy was in a freefall.” She explained that the economic effects “lasted for years, perhaps a decade.” But even more significantly, she outlined that the societal impact – “loss of faith in government, distrust of news, breakdown of social cohesion – could last even longer.” Finally, she asked if we could have done anything differently, and answered, “yes.” She concluded, “Are we as a global community now finally ready to do the hard work to prepare for the next pandemic?”Just two months after the Event 201 New York simulation, China announced the first case of COVID-19…Many aspects of the Event 201 simulation ring true today. The coronavirus pandemic; new public-private partnerships; travel bans; markets in freefall; a wartime footing; and flooding the information zone with controlled messaging. That the video sponsors are now some of the central actors in the real world crisis only amplifies the simulation’s significance.Just two months after the New York simulation, China announced the first case of COVID-19 on December 31, 2019. Chinese scientists identified and isolated the virus on January 7, 2020. On January 22, 2020, the WHO Emergency Committee “expressed divergent views on whether this event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) or not.”At around the same time, the World Economic Forum met in Davos, Switzerland, January 21-24, 2020. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus as well as other Event 201 participants were there. On January 24, another Gates Foundation entity engaged in vaccine development, the The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI), held a press conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos to provide an update on the outbreak, and announced a new partnership to develop vaccines for the virus as quickly as possible – before the outbreak became a global epidemic.Some speculate that the WHO decision to declare the emergency was made on the sidelines of the Davos meeting, perhaps in connection with the CEPI decision to prioritize coronavirus vaccines. The WHO Emergency Committee meeting in Geneva occurred in the same time frame on January 22. While any direct connection remains uncertain, Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus declared the Public Health Emergency of International Concern on January 30, 2020. The World Economic Forum immediately pledged its assistance, creating the COVID Action Platform, thus turning the fictional exercise into a high level working group behind the WHO. On January 31, 2020, the U.S. announced a travel ban on China, and events have evolved quickly since then.Mr. Ghebreyesus has been the WHO Director General since 2017. He’s the first African director and the first Director General who is not a physician. As Ethiopia’s Minister of Health, Mr. Ghebreyesus chaired the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria that the Gates Foundation co-founded. Today, the Gates Foundation is the WHO’s largest donor after the U.S., and the major funder behind the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunization (GAVI), another WHO funder.The Event 201 tabletop exercise shows us the kind of thinking going on as this crisis unfolds. It begs the question whether there can be any “benefit” from such a catastrophe.According to the August 2019 Gallup poll below, before the crisis, the healthcare industry, the federal government, and the pharmaceutical industry were at the very bottom of the public’s esteem. Negative perceptions ranged from minus 48% for healthcare, minus 52% for the federal government, to a stark minus 58% for pharma. The only other sector in negative territory was the advertising and public relations industry, also represented at the Event 201 table.The public may have held negative perceptions for a number of possible reasons:The COVID-19 virus has played a stunning role, shifting public perceptions almost overnight, lifting up the sectors that had been just months ago at the bottom.Remarkably, the pandemic seems to have pushed a “global reset” button. Pharma and biotech companies are racing to produce new coronavirus vaccines, with the expectation that the world’s population will clamor for them. Media follows the healthcare sector’s every move, creating genuine heroes among the doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers on the frontlines. Even this Administration, long plagued by low popularity ratings, has reached its highest approval rating ever.In a crisis, people want strong leaders and want to be on their teams, regardless of political leaning. In the new age of COVID-19, people are tuning in to federal health authorities, Congress, and the President, and grateful for whatever drugs and potential vaccines pharma and the healthcare industries put out. The COVID-19 virus thus has played a stunning role, shifting public perceptions almost overnight, lifting up the sectors that had been just months ago at the bottom.Not to say that people are not critical – they are – but pharma and healthcare stocks are rising, literally and figuratively, while most every other sector is plummeting, and Congress and the President are addressing the crisis and communicating with the public on a daily basis, and people are listening.Despite all the shifts, one thing is certain: change is the dynamic constant. Who knows what will happen in a month, or two months, or eighteen? “Event 201” offers some important insights into public-private crisis management and what could lie ahead.Sign up for free news and updates from Robert F.

"Herald Sun: Police Guarding 3,000 Residents as Public Housing Towers Forced into Lockdown","Three thousand people living in nine public housing towers in Melbourne have been placed under the severest lockdown rules of the coronavirus pandemic in Australia so far and have been banned from leaving their homes for at least five days.The Victorian government decided to lock down all nine towers because of “patterns of movement, friendship groups, family groups,” Premier Daniel Andrews said. He also said the crowded living in public housing and many communal spaces meant a high risk of community transmission.Five hundred police officers have been dispatched to monitor the nine towers in Flemington and North Melbourne and make sure that the residents do not leave their small and usually overcrowded units.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeResidents said they felt “singled out” by the lockdown order, which happened with no warning and a significant police presence. Those living in the flats are some of the most vulnerable and heavily policed people in the state of Victoria, with a high population of new migrants, Indigenous people, people experiencing severe mental illness, and people who have experienced homelessness or family violence.U of O Scientist Seeking Edible Vaccine for COVID-19 Hopes to Put Them in Veggies that People Would EatAndrews announced the “hard lockdown” of the nine towers late on Saturday. At the same time, he announced that two new postcodes – 3031 and 3051, in Flemington, Kensington, North Melbourne, and Hotham Hill – would be placed under stage-three stay-at-home orders from midnight.Those under stay-at-home orders can leave their homes to exercise, do grocery shopping, conduct essential caregiving, and attend work or study if they cannot do so remotely.Those living in the towers cannot. Andrews said the lockdown would be in place for at least five days because that was how long health officials estimated it would take to test every resident in those units and get the test results back. However, he said the lockdown could last 14 days, adding:“If you’re in one of those towers the minister has just read out, you will not be allowed to leave your unit, your dwelling within that tower, for any reason.”Ibuprofen And COVID-19 Symptoms: Here’s What You Need to KnowThe nine towers consist of more than 1,300 units. Andrews announced the state government would be arranging for food, healthcare, and other essential services to be delivered to the residents. Still, the details of how that will work have not been announced or discussed with residents.Richard Wynne, the housing minister, said people living in these public housing towers were “some of the most vulnerable people in our community.” Wynn said:“Many of them are subject to co-morbidities and we want to ensure that we wrap around them all of the services that they are going to need, not just over the next five days or indeed potentially the next 14 days, but going forward that we provide them with all of the support they need to maintain their tenancy but obviously to maintain their wellness also.”However, no social workers or other support services were seen outside the tower blocks in Flemington on Saturday night – only armed police officers wearing gloves and face masks.Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19Tower resident Hana, who shares a three-bedroom flat in one of the Racecourse Road towers with her mother and sister, said she had returned from grocery shopping just after 4 pm and was met by an “intimidating” police presence. She explained:“I was just shocked. I thought, I don’t know, it seemed like there was some criminal activity or something, like a stabbing or something … I asked, ‘What’s happened?’ and they said, ‘Oh, there’s an outbreak. You can’t leave your house. Just park your car, you can’t leave your house.'”Hana said it was unfair that the public housing blocks had been locked down when other large apartment buildings in the area had not, and also unfair that they had not been given any warning. She said:“You had other suburbs where they had 48 hours warning before they were put in lockdown. How come we are any different? It just feels like we have been singled out.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CNN: Drug Giant Stops Vaccine Trial Due to Unexplained Illness of Volunteer,"Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said Tuesday it had, in what it called a routine action, “voluntarily paused” a randomized clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine after one of its volunteers developed an unexplained illness.The company is developing the vaccine, called the Oxford vaccine, alongside the University of Oxford and is a frontrunner in the global race for a Covid-19 vaccine. A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said in a statement:“As part of the ongoing randomized, controlled global trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine, our standard review process triggered a pause to vaccination to allow review of safety data.This is a routine action which has to happen whenever there is a potentially unexplained illness in one of the trials, while it is investigated, ensuring we maintain the integrity of the trials. In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully.We are working to expedite the review of the single event to minimize any potential impact on the trial timeline. We are committed to the safety of our participants and the highest standards of conduct in our trials.”U of O Scientist Seeking Edible Vaccine for COVID-19 Hopes to Put Them in Veggies that People Would EatIt was not immediately clear where the patient was, or the nature and severity of their illness.AstraZeneca is one of nine companies currently in late-stage Phase 3 trials for their vaccine candidates.FOX: Doctor Claiming Covid-19 Conspiracy Tells Reporter “We Don’t Have Much Time”Earlier Tuesday, AstraZeneca joined eight other companies in signing a pledge promising they would not seek premature government approval for any coronavirus vaccine. They promised they would wait until they had adequate data showing any potential vaccine worked safely.The pledge was signed by the CEOs of AstraZeneca, BioNTech GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Moderna, Novavax, Pfizer and Sanofi. They said in a statement:“We, the undersigned biopharmaceutical companies, want to make clear our on-going commitment to developing and testing potential vaccines for COVID-19 in accordance with high ethical standards and sound scientific principles.We believe this pledge will help ensure public confidence in the rigorous scientific and regulatory process by which COVID-19 vaccines are evaluated and may ultimately be approved.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"USA TODAY: Police Agencies are Using Drones to Enforce Stay-at-Home Orders, Raising Concerns Among Civil Rights Groups","The coronavirus pandemic has forced police departments in the US and around the world to rethink the ways they enforce laws. Police agencies are increasingly relying on drones to do what they have not had to do before: policing while socially distancing.For example, here in my hometown, a drone with a loudspeaker attached to its top blared out:“This is the Daytona Beach Police Department. We apologize for the inconvenience, but due to COVID-19, this park is currently closed.”Several law enforcement agencies have recently unveiled drones that beam announcements at parks, beaches, and homeless camps to enforce stay-at-home orders and social-distancing guidelines.In Daytona Beach, Florida, officials say the drones can also be used during rescue operations, such as giving a drowning person a life preserver without actually touching them. Messod Bendayan, spokesman for the Daytona Beach Police Department, said:“We started thinking about ways of how we can limit the ability to transmit (COVID-19). Instead of risking an officer, we just fly the drone and have the drone speak a message. It keeps officers safe and keeps people safe.”Elon Musk explains why artificial intelligence is more dangerous than North KoreaAs you can imagine, civil rights groups have pushed back against the use of such technology, saying some of its capabilities are invasive and pose constitutional threats. One of these threats is the ability to detect someone’s body temperature from a distance. To civil rights and privacy advocates, this amounts to an indiscriminate warrantless search – obtaining the private health information of people who did not give consent and aren’t under a criminal investigation. Caleb Kruckenberg, litigation counsel for the Washington DC-based New Civil Liberties Alliance, said:“People have a right to privacy. You can’t just take their temperature without any reason. I think this is just an example of something that police departments have a tendency to do. Someone sells them on a new technology and they can come up with what they think is reason to use it and they use it, but they don’t necessarily think about how invasive it might be.”The group recently sent a letter asking the Daytona Beach Police Department to stop using drones that detect body temperatures.NY POST: Spanish Official Apologizes for Trying to Disinfect Beach with BleachBendayan said the primary function of the department’s drones is to patrol public places such as parks. He indicated officials were considering using drones to find out who may have a fever. However, they have not yet done so, and he said that the only plans to use the technology to measure body temperature would be limited to those who enter the police department lobby.Nevertheless, the use of drones has caused some controversy.For example, the police department in Westport, Connecticut, abruptly pulled out of a pilot drone program that would’ve allowed the agency to monitor people’s temperatures from a distance and detect sneezing and coughing.Police Chief Foti Koskinas said last month that the department’s plan to participate in the drone program “resulted in varied expressions of public concern and reservations.” The idea was not well received and led to more questions.David McGuire, executive director of the ACLU in Connecticut, said the group is skeptical of local governments that are partnering with drone companies without information about what to do with the data the machines are collecting. McGuire said because many of those with COVID-19 are asymptomatic, fever-detecting drones may not be effective in limiting the spread of the virus. He added:“The COVID-19 virus is a grave public health risk, so we shouldn’t write off tools that might help mitigate the problem. But we also must recognize that technology is no magic pill to stemming the pandemic. The urgent need at the moment, according to public health experts, is to ramp up testing capability, suppress transmission through social distancing measures, and support our hospitals as they face an influx of patients.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeThe controversy over the use of drones emphasizes the uncertainty around a technology that’s capable of gathering personal information.Still, the technology is already being used in places around the globe. USA Today reports:In Italy, police are using drones to check on residents who have tested positive for COVID-19. In India, police are using drones to track large gatherings and monitor narrow roads police cars can’t get to. In France, health warnings are blared through drones flying over deserted beaches. DJI Enterprise, a drone company headquartered in Shenzen in southeastern China, said it has provided the technology to 43 law enforcement and public safety agencies in 22 states.Don Roby, third chairperson of the International Association of Police Chief’s aviation committee, said police departments should be transparent, especially when they’re using technology that’s not available to the general public. He said:“It’s up to the chiefs, the sheriffs, the police commissioners to define what missions they’re going to use the drones for. … They should be seeking some input from the community.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"Newsweek: Judge Rules Pennsylvania’s ‘New Normal’ Pandemic Restrictions Are Unconstitutional, Sides With Small Businesses","A federal judge ruled Monday that Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s pandemic restrictions are unconstitutional.U.S. District Judge William Stickman IV sided with small business owners and Republican officeholders who filed suit against the governor’s orders that required people to stay at home, placed size limits on gatherings, and ordered non-life-sustaining businesses to shut down.The judge called the Wolf administration’s coronavirus policies overreaching and arbitrary. Wolf’s efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus “were undertaken with the good intention of addressing a public health emergency. But even in an emergency, the authority of government is not unfettered,” Stickman wrote in his ruling, adding:“The Constitution cannot accept the concept of a ‘new normal’ where the basic liberties of the people can be subordinated to open-ended emergency mitigation measures.”1Newsweek: Contact-Tracing Apps Could Become Permanent Once the Pandemic Is OverThe state’s two top Republican lawmakers, House Speaker Bryan Cutler and House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, issued a joint statement praising the ruling: “For the millions of unemployed Pennsylvanians, the thousands of small business owners that have seen their livelihoods permanently ended, and all those looking for some relief from these unilaterally imposed, inconsistent and contradictory shutdown orders, this opinion offers some form of hope that a return to normalcy might be on the horizon.”1MSN: Why Covid Herd Immunity Could Be ‘Twice as High as First Thought’The governor’s office released the following statement in response to the ruling:“The administration is disappointed with the result and will seek a stay of the decision and file an appeal. The actions taken by the administration were mirrored by governors across the country and saved, and continue to save lives in the absence of federal action. This decision is especially worrying as Pennsylvania and the rest of the country are likely to face a challenging time with the possible resurgence of COVID-19 and the flu in the fall and winter.“Today’s court ruling is limited to the business closure order and the stay at home orders issued in March and were later suspended, as well as the indoor and outdoor gathering limitations.“This ruling does not impact any of the other mitigation orders currently in place including, but not limited to, the targeted mitigation orders announced in July, mandatory telework, mandatory mask order, worker safety order, and the building safety order.”2The Pennsylvania counties involved in the suit were Butler, Greene, Fayette and Washington.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"CNBC: Bill Gates Suggests Calling Out Non-Mask Wearers and Using Peer Pressure, Experts Say Bad Advice","As health experts continue to plead with Americans to wear masks to help slow the spread of Covid-19, billionaire Bill Gates suggested using peer pressure as a way to get non-mask-wearers to change.Rather than force people to wear a mask, ”[w]hat you need is that if you’re walking around without a mask, people go, ‘Hey, buddy, that’s inappropriate,”’ Gates told Business Insider in an interview published Thursday. Giving people “this sense of we’re in it together” will work better than federal penalties, he said, adding:“You really need everyone that you respect, who you listen to, to be setting out that message, and the U.S. just isn’t there.”However, Julia Marcus, an epidemiologist and professor at Harvard Medical School whose research centers around HIV prevention, warns against calling someone out for being irresponsible or selfish, telling CNBC:“While it’s perfectly valid to ask someone to wear a mask if you can’t move away from them, I think we need to be careful about shaming people, which can actually cement their resistance.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeMarcus’ HIV prevention research has shown that shame can be a huge barrier when it comes to public health. Instead, Marcus suggests saying something like:“Would you mind wearing a mask while you’re around me?”She has also recommended a similar tactic used to get people to use condoms during the AIDS crisis — make masks readily available at places like stores or airports where they are most needed, she told The Verge.Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsAziza Ahmed, a law professor who specializes in health at Northeastern University, advises it’s okay to put “little bit of social pressure on people” you know, but not necessarily with strangers. People are more likely to listen to someone they know because they want to their loved ones “to feel comfortable” around them, she says, adding:“It’s a good idea to remind our neighbors and friends to wear masks and socially distance, and I think those are the types of interactions that will make a difference.”“I am less inclined to support the idea that we should be policing each other’s behavior at random.”According to recent study, researchers at the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluations (IHME) predicted if everyone in the U.S. wears a mask, 58% of Covid-19 deaths could be prevented by the fall. IHME estimated that mask use is currently between 20% and 60% in the U.S.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Newsweek Says Study Shows Anti Vaccine Support Could Reach Dominance in 10 Years,"Anti-vaccine social media groups are winning at attracting undecided users to their cause over their pro-science counterparts, a new study finds.The project, led by Neil Johnson, professor of physics at George Washington University, who also heads a new initiative in Complexity and Data Science, analyzed Facebook communities containing close to 100 million individuals. The study grouped them into color-coded “clusters” to chart how members interact, shift, and share links, and illustrates how differing stances on vaccination have evolved and competed over time.For the study, investigators developed an innovative tool to map vaccine conversations among 100 million Facebook users during the height of the 2019 measles outbreak. Johnson noted:“There is a new world war online surrounding trust in health expertise and science, particularly with misinformation about COVID-19, but also distrust in big pharmaceuticals and governments. Nobody knew what the field of battle looked like, though, so we set to find out.”1Join the fight for medical freedom of choiceWhile vaccine supporters (coded “Blue”) outnumber users with anti-vaccine views (coded “Red”) on Facebook, the platform has nearly three times as many anti-vaccination communities. According to the study, that makes it far more likely that their views will reach undecided people (coded “Green”).The Historical Facts on Measles and the Measles Vaccine Censored by Mainstream MediaResearchers also found that pro-vaccine communities may be putting their focus in the wrong place. Researchers suggested that those concentrating on larger anti-vaccination communities might miss chances to influence medium-sized communities that are growing under the radar.The study also noted that anti-vaccination groups offer lots of content about vaccines and other proven health treatments, such as safety concerns, conspiracy theories, or individual choice. With about 3 billion people using the social media platform, this content increases their chance of influencing Facebook users who are undecided.Pro-vaccination communities typically focused their messages on the public health benefits of vaccination, according to the study. In a university press release, Johnson said:“We thought we would see major public health entities and state-run health departments at the center of this online battle, but we found the opposite. They were fighting off to one side, in the wrong place.”“Instead of playing whack-a-mole with a global network of communities that consume and produce [mis]information, public health agencies, social media platforms and governments can use a map like ours and an entirely new set of strategies to identify where the largest theaters of online activity are and engage and neutralize those communities peddling in misinformation so harmful to the public.”1RFK, Jr.: Gardasil “The Science” video and other factsUnder present conditions, one predictive model used by the scientists observed that anti-vaccination support could reach dominance in approximately ten years. Johnson said:“This is now a war over hearts and minds. The growing success of Red lies in the fact that Red now offers lots of attractive ‘flavors’ of health-related narrative, such as questioning role of big pharma, government, civil liberties, freedom of choice for their kids etc. By contrast, Blue is like vanilla, one flavor of message.”1Johnson has continued to monitor the trends during the ongoing novel coronavirus outbreak, and says targeting undecided individuals is critical. Referencing the cluster color coding, he explained:“With COVID-19, this is a perfect storm since Blue itself is not 100 percent sure about the science. Since the start of COVID-19, we already see Green communities in this picture turning Red.“The implication is that instead of trying to convince Red, which is very hard and may backfire to make them stronger, Blue should focus on intelligently engaging Green. Like in an insurgency, the battle should be for hearts and minds. Greens are much larger numerically in total, and could tip the balance away from herd immunity if not enough Greens get vaccinated against COVID-19, when a vaccine appears.“Though the focus is on vaccines and COVID-19, the same applies for other scientific distrust, including climate change. Don’t fight the Reds, engage the Greens.”1",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: Publix is Buying Excess Milk and Produce From Farmers — and Donating it to Food Banks,"Farmers around the country have had to dump milk and waste fresh produce as restaurants, schools, and other institutions remain closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. In response, on Wednesday, Supermarket chain Publix launched a new initiative to help struggling farmers — and get the food to Americans who need it most.The company’s press release said it will purchase fresh produce and milk from farmers impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and donate the goods directly to Feeding America food banks that are in its “operating area.” During the first week of the initiative alone, some 150,000 pounds of produce and 43,500 gallons of milk is expected to be donated, the company said. Publix CEO Todd Jones said:“As a food retailer, we have the unique opportunity to bridge the gap between the needs of families and farmers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.

How Ticketmaster Might Check Your Vaccine Status for Concerts,"Editor’s note: Ticketmaster has now said that while they were exploring this idea, they are no longer going to go forward with this option. Many in the industry have stated publicly in main stream news that they believe the backlash is the reason why. Either way, we are glad to hear they are not going to move forward.As an experimental vaccine for COVID-19 continues to make progress, the concert industry is preparing for a potential return to live events in the coming months.According to Billboard, Ticketmaster is working on a plan to use smartphones to verify whether customers have been vaccinated or tested for coronavirus.While the plan is still in its early phases, Billboard reports the process would involve fans using the Ticketmaster app in partnership with medical information firms and vaccine and testing distributors.Upon buying a ticket, fans would be required to either verify their vaccination status or prove they have tested negative for coronavirus within 72 hours before the concert dates. Regional health authorities would determine the length of coverage for any test.MSN: Why Covid Herd Immunity Could Be ‘Twice as High as First Thought’After being tested, customers would authorize a lab to share their results with a health pass company, according to the report.

The Times: Coronavirus May Vanish Too Fast for Vaccine Trial,"One of the scientists behind the Oxford coronavirus vaccine has warned there is only a 50 percent chance of it working because cases in the UK are declining so fast.The University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute and the Oxford Vaccine Group began developing a COVID-19 vaccine in January using a virus taken from chimpanzees.With the number of UK coronavirus cases dropping every day, there may not be enough people to test it on, according to the institute’s director Professor Adrian Hill, who noted: “It’s a race against the virus disappearing, and against time. We said earlier in the year that there was an 80% chance of developing an effective vaccine by September.“But at the moment, there’s a 50% chance that we get no result at all.

It also contains part of the coronavirus that would trigger the body’s immune response to COVID-19’s spike proteins which it uses to enter human cells and multiply.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
USA Today: Thousands Gather at Wisconsin State Capitol to Protest Coronavirus Restrictions,"Thousands of people gathered and stood shoulder to shoulder cheering “USA” and “open up” on the steps of the Wisconsin State Capitol on Friday to protest Gov. Tony Evers’ restrictions on their daily lives.The crowd gathered close together in solidarity, in defiance of the Democratic governor’s order to keep businesses and schools closed, and people apart, on a day the state saw its highest daily increase in positive cases of coronavirus.Petitions to recall Evers were circulating among the crowd and signs that said “All Workers Are Essential” and “Death … is preferable to communism.”Dozens of American flags accompanied the protesters and some openly carried assault-style rifles. Cindy Warner of Milwaukee said:“I think this will make Evers respond. People of different backgrounds, races and cultures all want to get back to work.

CNN: Wisconsin Supreme Court Strikes Down State’s Stay-at-Home Order,"The Wisconsin Supreme Court has overturned the state’s stay-at-home order, ruling it “unlawful” and “unenforceable” in a high-profile win for the state’s Republican-led Legislature.In a 4-3 decision Wednesday, the court ruled that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers’ administration overstepped its authority when the state Department of Health Services extended the order to May 26.The ruling comes after the Legislature’s Republican leaders filed a lawsuit last month arguing the order would cost Wisconsin residents their jobs and hurt many companies, asserting that if it was left in place, “our State will be in shambles.”The suit was explicitly filed against state Department of Health Services Secretary-designee Andrea Palm and other health officials, who made the decision in mid-April to extend the state’s “Safer at Home” emergency order. At the same time as the extension, the state loosened some restrictions on specific businesses, including golf courses, public libraries, and arts and crafts stores.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeIn their decision Wednesday, the justices wrote:“(that) an agency cannot confer on itself the power to dictate the lives of law-abiding individuals as comprehensively as the order does without reaching beyond the executive branch’s authority.”Evers, who had ordered Palm to issue the stay-at-home order in late March, has not yet released a statement on the ruling — though he made his thoughts on the lawsuit clear when it was first filed, tweeting:“Republicans are exploiting a global pandemic to further their attempts to undermine the will of the people. But what’s at stake goes far beyond political power–lives are on the line. This isn’t a game. This isn’t funny. People die every day because of this virus — often times painful and lonely deaths — and the more we delay or play political games the more people die.”New York Times: CDC Labs Were Contaminated, Delaying US Coronavirus Testing, Officials SayStill, Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald claimed in a joint statement after filing their lawsuit that there’s “immense frustration regarding the extension” of the order and that Evers “has denied the people a voice through this unprecedented administrative overreach.” They said:“Unfortunately, that leaves the legislature no choice but to ask the Supreme Court to rein in this obvious abuse of power. Wisconsinites deserve certainty, transparency, and a plan to end the constant stream of executive orders that are eroding both the economy and their liberty even as the state is clearly seeing a decline in Covid infections.”Wisconsin Democrats, however, have argued that the health crisis “will only get worse if we end Safer at Home before it’s safe to.”The ruling said all future lockdown orders must go through the legislature. The Safer at Home order will remain in place for six days, giving the legislature time to come up with new guidance in coordination with Evers’ office, according to the court.As of Wednesday, Wisconsin, with a statewide population of almost 6 million, had a little over 10,902 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 421 deaths, according to the state’s Department of Health Services.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
WaPo: Sinclair TV Stations Delay Airing Interview With ‘Plandemic’ Researcher Amid Backlash,"Was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top expert on infectious diseases, responsible for the creation of the coronavirus? Local television stations owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group are set to air a conspiracy theory over the weekend that suggests just that.The conspiracy theory is set to air on stations across the country in a segment during the “America This Week” program hosted by Eric Bolling.The show, which is posted online before it is broadcast over the weekend, is distributed to Sinclair Broadcast Group’s network of local television stations, one of the largest in the country.Earlier this year, a survey by Pew Research Group showed that local news was an indispensable source of information on the coronavirus for many Americans and more trusted than the media overall.In this week’s episode of the show, Bolling spoke with Judy Mikovits, the medical researcher featured in the “Plandemic” video that went viral earlier this year and was banned from platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. Bolling also spoke with Mikovits’ attorney, Larry Klayman.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeThroughout the segment, the on-screen graphic read, “DID DR. FAUCI CREATE COVID-19?”During the interview, Mikovits told Bolling that Dr. Anthony Fauci had over the past decade “manufactured” and shipped coronaviruses to Wuhan, China, which became the original epicenter of the current outbreak. Bolling noted that this was a “hefty claim,” but did not meaningfully challenge Mikovits and allowed her to continue making her case.Klayman, who did not respond to a request for comment, also pushed conspiracy theories about the coronavirus. He said the “origins” of the virus were in the United States. Bolling didn’t meaningfully challenge Klayman either.ABC: YouTube CEO Yanks Video of Urgent Care MDs Talking About COVID-19In the segment that immediately followed, Bolling spoke to Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier to respond to the claims from Mikovits and Klayman.Bolling and Saphier agreed that it was, in Saphier’s words, “highly unlikely” that Fauci was behind the coronavirus. But they went on to theorize about other possible explanations for what had happened. Saphier said it was possible the virus was “man-made within a laboratory” and escaped.The Sinclair Broadcast Group has drawn criticism in the past for pushing a conservative political worldview in its newscasts and programming decisions. But Bolling, a former Fox News host, told CNN Business in a series of text messages that he invited Mikovits onto his show to “question and challenge her beliefs.” Bolling also said he does not control the on-screen graphics that appear during his show.“I did challenge her,” Bolling said, noting he called her claim “hefty.” When pressed over whether calling a claim “hefty” constituted effectively challenging the conspiracy theory Mikovits pushed, Bolling said that he did believe he challenged her.NY Post: Top Manhattan ER Doc Commits Suicide, Shaken by Coronavirus OnslaughtBolling then told CNN Business that he was not aware of the viral “Plandemic” video Mikovits was featured in earlier this year, and said Saphier “was not originally booked on the show” and that he added her to “provide an opposing viewpoint,” adding:“I don’t know of any video she was in prior to or after appearing on my show. Frankly, I was shocked when she made the accusation. I asked our producers to add Saphier to the show for the express purpose of debunking the conspiracy theory. I believe viewers see that I did not and do not endorse her theory.”When asked if he really was unaware that Mikovits had been in a viral video earlier in the year pushing misinformation about coronavirus, Bolling said he had been, saying:“I give you my word… this is the first I’ve heard of the video. And the very first time I heard of Dr. Mikovits was the morning of taping.”But when asked whether, now that he was aware of the video, he had any second thoughts about airing the segment with Mikovits, Bolling, who said he “certainly didn’t endorse her theory,” replied:“I don’t second guess my producers and bookers.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Newsweek: Dr. Fauci Backed Controversial Wuhan Lab with Millions of U.S. Dollars for Risky Coronavirus Research,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the coronavirus task force, has been called the top physician and immunologist in the country. One poll indicates that Americans trust Fauci more than the president on the coronavirus pandemic.But just last year, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the organization led by Dr. Fauci, funded scientists at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and other institutions for work on gain-of-function research on bat coronaviruses.In 2019, with the backing of NIAID, the National Institutes of Health committed $3.7 million over six years for research that included some gain-of-function work. The program followed another $3.7 million, 5-year project for collecting and studying bat coronaviruses, which ended in 2019, bringing the total to $7.4 million.BREAKING: RFK Jr. Asks if Dr. Shiva Owning a Vaccine Company & Partnering with Microsoft is Why He’s Splintering the MovementGain of function research involves manipulating viruses in the lab to explore their potential for infecting humans. Many scientists have criticized the research because it creates a risk of starting a pandemic from accidental release. SARS-CoV-2 , the virus now causing a global pandemic, is believed to have originated in bats. U.S. intelligence originally asserted that the coronavirus had occurred naturally. However, it conceded last month that the pandemic may have originated in a leak from the Wuhan lab. (At this point most scientists say it’s possible—but not likely—that the pandemic virus was engineered or manipulated.)Dr. Fauci did not respond to Newsweek’s requests for comment. NIH responded with a statement that said in part: “Most emerging human viruses come from wildlife, and these represent a significant threat to public health and biosecurity in the U.S. and globally, as demonstrated by the SARS epidemic of 2002-03, and the current COVID-19 pandemic…. scientific research indicates that there is no evidence that suggests the virus was created in a laboratory.”The NIH research consisted of two parts. The first part got underway in 2014 and involved surveillance of bat coronaviruses, and had a budget of $3.7 million. Part one funded Shi Zheng-Li, a virologist at the Wuhan lab named, along with other researchers. They were tasked with investigating and cataloging bat coronaviruses in the wild. Phase one was completed in 2019.ABC: YouTube CEO Yanks Video of Urgent Care MDs Talking About COVID-19Phase two of the project also began in 2019, and included further surveillance work but also gain-of-function research to understand how bat coronaviruses could mutate to attack humans. The project was run by EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit research group, under the direction of President Peter Daszak, an expert on disease ecology. NIH canceled the project just this past Friday, April 24th, Politico reported. Daszak did not immediately respond to Newsweek requests for comment.The project proposal states: “We will use S protein sequence data, infectious clone technology, in vitro and in vivo infection experiments and analysis of receptor binding to test the hypothesis that % divergence thresholds in S protein sequences predict spillover potential.”In layman’s terms, “spillover potential” refers to the ability of a virus to jump from animals to humans, which requires that the virus be able to attach to receptors in the cells of humans. SARS-CoV-2, for instance, is capable of binding to the ACE2 receptor in human lungs and other organs.According to Richard Ebright, an infectious disease expert at Rutgers University (and a vocal opponent of gain-of-function research), the project description refers to experiments that would enhance the ability of bat coronavirus to infect human cells and laboratory animals using techniques of genetic engineering. In the wake of the pandemic, that is a noteworthy detail.Dr. Fauci is distinguished for his work on the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1990s. Born in Brooklyn, he graduated first in his class from Cornell University Medical College in 1966. As head of NIAID since 1984, he has served as an adviser to every U.S. president since Ronald Reagan (the past six presidents).A decade ago, during a controversy over gain-of-function research on bird-flu viruses, Dr. Fauci played an essential role in advancing the work. He argued that the research was worth the risk because it enables scientists to make preparations, such as investigating possible anti-viral medications that could be useful if and when a pandemic occurred.NY Post: Top Manhattan ER Doc Commits Suicide, Shaken by Coronavirus OnslaughtThe work in question was a type of gain-of-function research that involved taking wild viruses and passing them through live animals until they mutate into a form that could pose a pandemic threat. Scientists used it to take a virus that was poorly transmitted among humans and make it into one that was highly transmissible—a hallmark of a pandemic virus. This work was done by infecting a series of ferrets, allowing the virus to mutate until a ferret that hadn’t been deliberately infected contracted the disease.The work entailed risks that worried even seasoned researchers. More than 200 scientists called for the work to be halted. The problem, they said, is that it increased the likelihood that a pandemic would occur through a laboratory accident.Dr. Fauci defended the work, writing two co-authors in the Washington Post on December 30, 2011:“[D]etermining the molecular Achilles’ heel of these viruses can allow scientists to identify novel antiviral drug targets that could be used to prevent infection in those at risk or to better treat those who become infected,” . Decades of experience tells us that disseminating information gained through biomedical research to legitimate scientists and health officials provides a critical foundation for generating appropriate countermeasures and, ultimately, protecting the public health.”Nevertheless, in 2014, under pressure from the Obama administration, the National of Institutes of Health instituted a moratorium on the work, suspending 21 studies.Daily Mail: Doctor with COVID-19 Falls to Her Death from Hospital in RussiaHowever, three years later, in December 20107, the NIH ended the moratorium, and the second phase of the NIAID project, which included the gain-of-function research, began. The NIH established a structure for determining how the research would go forward: scientists have to get approval from a panel of experts, who would decide whether the risks were justified.The reviews were conducted in secret, an aspect for which the NIH has drawn criticism. In early 2019, after a reporter for Science magazine discovered that the NIH had approved two influenza research projects that used gain of function methods, scientists who oppose this kind of research condemned the NIH in an editorial in the Washington Post. Tom Inglesby of Johns Hopkins University and Marc Lipsitch of Harvard wrote:“We have serious doubts about whether these experiments should be conducted at all. [W]ith deliberations kept behind closed doors, none of us will have the opportunity to understand how the government arrived at these decisions or to judge the rigor and integrity of that process.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
David Icke Gets Double Whammy as Facebook and YouTube Remove His Pages,"Facebook has removed a page belonging to David Icke after social media platforms came under pressure for offering a stage to the author, lecturer and conspiracy theorist, whose messages about Covid-19 have continued to gain viewers.On Friday, the campaign group the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) published an open letter calling on tech companies to ban Mr. Icke’s accounts. The letter said Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and YouTube had increased “Icke’s racism and misinformation about Covid-19 to millions of people”.Newsweek: Dr. Fauci Backed Controversial Wuhan Lab with Millions of U.S. Dollars for Risky Coronavirus ResearchFollowing the ban, Icke’s Twitter account posted:“Fascist Facebook deletes David Icke – the elite are TERRIFIED.”Facebook said in a statement:“We have removed this Page for repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation”.BREAKING: RFK Jr. Asks if Dr. Shiva Owning a Vaccine Company & Partnering with Microsoft is Why He’s Splintering the MovementInterestingly, London Real, the popular local station in the UK, faces sanctions as it is suggested they caused danger by interviewing David Icke.The former footballer and sports broadcaster has claimed that the pandemic is linked to 5G.

The network went on to say that Icke, when asked for his reaction to reports of 5G masts being set on fire in England and Northern Ireland, responded:“If 5G continues and reaches where they want to take it, human life as we know it is over… so people have to make a decision.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CNN: Bar Installs Electric Fence to Keep Customers at “Safe” Distance,"A pub in England installed an electric fence in front of its bar to ensure thirsty customers practice social distancing.Jonny McFadden, who runs the Star Inn in St Just, Cornwall, said that the idea to use the fence came as he was preparing to reopen the pub.

Bill Gates Called Most US Coronavirus Tests “Garbage”,"Billionaire public health advocate Bill Gates, who’s been critical of the U.S. coronavirus response since the beginning, shared some new thoughts about the country’s diagnostic testing situation, calling it utter trash.Melinda Gates Said Black People Should be First in Line, After Health Care Workers, to be Vaccinated Against COVID-19His frustration wasn’t specifically about the quality or accuracy of the tests and the results they provide, though that has been questioned in the past. Gates indicated his issue is with how long it takes to get the results in the first place, telling Wired in a recent interview:“The majority of all U.S. tests are completely garbage, wasted.”Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeGates, who called the delays “stupidity,” said the current delays for test results essentially render them useless. Positive or negative, many in the U.S. are going weeks before they hear back about their nasal swabs. That’s a dangerously long time for people to continue going about their lives if they’re unsure whether or not they might spread COVID-19.Gates suggests that the testing companies’ reimbursement should be tied to how long it takes to send back results. With that extra incentive, Gates thinks that results will come back way sooner, telling Wired:“You have to have the reimbursement system pay a little bit extra for 24 hours, pay the normal fee for 48 hours, and pay nothing [if it isn’t done by then]. And they will fix it overnight.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
‘Zoom Fatigue’ is Taxing the Brain. Here’s Why that Happens.,"As social distancing remains in effect across the country during the coronavirus pandemic, many people are bouncing from one video call to another. We use video-calling for meetings, school classrooms, visiting with family, and even social gatherings. But mental health and communications experts warn there may be an unintended effect: “Zoom fatigue,” or the feeling of tiredness, anxiousness or worry with yet another video call. Suzanne Degges-White, a licensed counselor and chair of counseling and counselor education at Northern Illinois University, said:“When we’re on all these videos calls all day long, we’re kind of chained to a screen. It’s just psychologically off-putting. I’ve got to show up again but the thing is, we’re not really showing up anywhere,” she said.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeSo many people are describing similar experiences that it’s earned its own slang term, Zoom fatigue. However, this exhaustion also applies if you’re using Google Hangouts, Skype, FaceTime, or any other video-calling interface. The unprecedented explosion of their use in response to the pandemic has started an unofficial social experiment, showing at a population scale what’s always been true: virtual interactions can be extremely hard on the brain.From having to focus on 15 people at once in gallery view or worrying about how you appear as you speak, many things may cause someone to feel anxious or worried on a video call. Each of these factors require more focus and mental energy than a face-to-face meeting might, according to Vaile Wright, the American Psychological Association’s director of clinical research and quality. She said:“It’s this pressure to really be on and be responsive.”Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsAccording to Jeremy Bailenson, the founding director of Stanford’s Virtual Human Interaction Lab, the platforms naturally put us in an unnatural position. A combination of having prolonged eye contact and having someone’s enlarged face extremely close to you forces certain subconscious responses in humans. He said:“Our brains have evolved to have a very intense reaction when you have a close face to you.”Humans communicate even when they’re quiet. During an in-person conversation, the brain focuses partly on the words being spoken. Still, it also derives additional meaning from dozens of non-verbal cues, such as whether someone is facing you or slightly turned away, if they’re fidgeting while you talk, or if they inhale quickly in preparation to interrupt.These subtle cues help to set the tone of the interaction. Since humans evolved as social animals, perceiving these cues comes naturally to most of us, takes little conscious effort to parse, and can lay the groundwork for emotional intimacy.Bailenson added that during normal, in-person conversations, “eye contact moves in a very intricate dance, and we’re very good at it.” When one person looks one way, another changes where they look. A small eyebrow raise from someone at one end of the room can trigger a glance between two people on the other. But typically, we don’t stare into our colleagues’ eyes, up close on a computer screen, for an hour at a time.Bill Gates – Most Dangerous Philanthropist in Modern History?So much of human communication is through these nonverbal cues that can be either lost or distorted in a video conference. Degges-White said:“In a way, we’re closer but we’re still communicating through this weird filter, so it gets tiring to get to the real stuff through this filter.” Degges-White described it as creating a structure to the conversation that isn’t normally there. One person speaks, and everyone takes their turn and waits to reply. She said:“That’s not normally the way we do social interactions. It’s not that easy give and take.” Side conversations are lost. Some people who are normally reserved may never get a word in. Others may get distracted by people in their house. The context of this happening during the coronavirus pandemic can’t be lost either, Wright said. We’re worried about loved ones but apart from them physically. e suggested that not every video call needs to be a video call, adding:“Be thoughtful about how you’re using Zoom calls.

"Mom, a Former Cop, Arrested on Miami Beach After She Walks Out Onto the Sand in Protest of Its Closure","Miami Beach police arrested a woman protesting Sunday afternoon who walked onto the sand in South Beach, which is illegal under county orders.Kimberlee Falkenstine, a 33-year-old Miami resident, was charged with resisting an officer without violence, trespassing after receiving a warning and violating an emergency order.Falkenstine left a designated protest area in Lummus Park where about 50 others had gathered. She walked past signs and orange plastic barriers, indicating the beach was closed. She then sat down with a sign that said, “we are free,” according to an arrest report, which stated:“The defendant stated she left the designated protest area and wanted to sit on the beach to make a statement.”Police said Falkenstine “mentioned that the beach was for the public and that it was her right to be there.”Chris Nelson, one of the protest organizers who filmed the arrest, said Falkenstine decided on her own to walk onto the beach.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeFootage of the arrest posted to Facebook shows officers addressing Falkenstine multiple times before at least three officers picked her up and carried her to a police car that was parked on the beach nearby. Officers warned the woman “numerous times” to leave, according to Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez.After Falkenstine was handcuffed around 4 p.m., she “dropped her dead weight and [refused] to move,” so officers carried her to the police car, the arrest report says.She was taken to the Miami Beach police station and then to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center in West Miami-Dade, where, according to Miami-Dade online records, she was held on $2,500 bond.Several protesters, including Falkenstine, had gathered inside a designated, fenced-off area to speak up against the ongoing closure of beaches and businesses considered non-essential in Miami-Dade County due to the continuing novel coronavirus pandemic.A few dozen people held signs and chanted, “all jobs are essential,” and “freedom over fear.”All beaches in Miami-Dade County have been closed since March 19, following an emergency order to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Out of 1,721 recorded deaths in Florida from the novel coronavirus as of Sunday, 487 (28%) have been residents of Miami-Dade county, according to the Florida Department of Health.Under the county’s executive order, all beaches were closed except those under state or federal jurisdiction. The county has since reopened parks and some recreational facilities with restrictions in place, but beaches remain closed.CBS: Miami-Dade Sewage Leak Still Not Fixed, Over 1,000,000 Gallons Spilled So FarMiami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber has said he plans to keep his city’s beaches closed until at least early June, even if the county allows them to open sooner. Gelber has acknowledged that people likely died as a result of spring break parties and tourists who visited Miami Beach in March even as the novel coronavirus was spreading across the region. Gelber said last month:“We know that people died because of those gatherings. It makes no sense to gamble that we’ll be fine. This isn’t the time to hope you’re lucky.”Gov. Ron DeSantis allowed some Florida beaches to reopen in mid-April after shutting them down earlier in the month. But Miami-Dade and Broward County have been excluded from those measures. Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Friday that some businesses would be allowed to reopen May 18. Beaches throughout the county will remain closed.The incident on the beach Sunday was the only arrest made at the protest, which remained peaceful. Miami Beach officials knew earlier in the day that the protest was planned. Most who showed up were not wearing masks and stood a few feet from one another while chanting and holding signs. Miami Beach and Miami-Dade County officials have offered mixed messages on whether masks are required to be worn in parks at all times.Police did not ask the protesters to disperse, despite a countywide ban on public gatherings of 10 or more people. City Attorney Raul Aguila said the protesters didn’t have a permit or need one to hold the event, but that officials decided to let them gather “under agreed upon conditions and limitations.” Aguila told the Herald:“I think this is certainly a better plan, in light of other similar demonstrations taking place around the country which have ended in violence and loss to property.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

"The Same Number of People Could Die from ‘Deaths of Despair’ as Have Already Died in the U.S. from Coronavirus, New Study Finds","The growing epidemic of ‘deaths of despair’ in the U.S. is increasing due to the coronavirus pandemic. It could drive suicide, drug, and alcohol deaths as high as 150,000, according to new research released by Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care.Projections of additional “deaths of despair” range from 27,644, assuming a quick economic recovery and the smallest impact from unemployment, to 154,037, assuming a slow recovery and the most significant impact from unemployment. The researchers wrote in the “deaths of despair” report published last Friday:We can prevent these deaths by taking meaningful and comprehensive action as a nation. More Americans could lose their lives to deaths of despair, deaths due to drug, alcohol, and suicide, if we do not do something immediately. Deaths of despair have been on the rise for the last decade, and in the context of COVID-19, deaths of despair should be seen as the epidemic within the pandemic.1As of Sunday in the United States, 8.7 million people had been tested for SARS-CoV-2, with 1,283,929 confirmed cases. The epicenter of the pandemic remains in New York state, with 26,535 deaths. Worldwide, there were 4,081,970 confirmed cases and 281,399 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.Newsweek: Dr. Fauci Backed Controversial Wuhan Lab with Millions of U.S. Dollars for Risky Coronavirus ResearchPresident Donald Trump has frequently warned that efforts to stem the rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2, are spiraling the economy into another Great Recession. Trump recently told ABC News about his decision to reopen the economy, saying:People are dying the other way too when you look at what happens with drugs, it goes up, when you look at suicides.1Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer at the Well Being Trust, said the federal government must fully support and invest in a plan to improve mental-health care, adding:If we work to put in place healthy community conditions, good health-care coverage, and inclusive policies, we can improve mental health and well-being.1Bill Gates – Most Dangerous Philanthropist in Modern History?The Well Being Trust is a national foundation dedicated to advancing the mental, social, and spiritual health of the nation. The Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care is an independent research unit affiliated with the American Academy of Family Physicians, and works to improve individual and population health by enhancing the delivery of primary care.The researchers issued a warning for the months and even years ahead, arguing for additional investment in health care and strategies to deal with the phenomenon. They wrote: A preventable surge of avoidable deaths from drugs, alcohol, and suicide is ahead of us if the country does not begin to invest in solutions that can help heal the nation’s isolation, pain, and suffering.SARS CoV-2 is having an unprecedented impact on the world. No one alive can recall any infection or worldwide event of such magnitude and scale. Along with the tens of thousands of deaths in the United States from the virus, COVID-19 overlays the growing epidemic of deaths of despair threatening to make an already significant problem even worse.1NY POST: New York Mom with Coronavirus Saved by Medical-Student Son’s Quick ThinkingApproximately 134,000 people in the U.S. could die from COVID-19, more than double an estimate five weeks ago of 72,000, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington’s School of Medicine. According to Market Watch, that projection is watched closely by the White House and could go as high as 243,000, taking into account the institute’s margin of error.The debate over the ramifications of a months-long shutdown of the American economy has been both emotional and sobering. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for more than three decades and one of the leading experts in the U.S. on infectious diseases, has pleaded with people to “socially distance.”The debate over the economy’s survival vs. the public health emergency highlights, as well, the gap between left and right on the American political spectrum. The left generally believes that strong social structures support a stronger economy for all. The right traditionally follows the idea that a strong economic system supports strong social structures for all.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
MSN: Businesses in Australia Call for Right to Sack Workers Who Refuse Vaccine,"Australian businesses are calling for the right to fire employees who refuse to take the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available as the government considers how to encourage widespread uptake. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said around 95 percent of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to achieve herd immunity.

Slaoui is to serve in a volunteer capacity alongside Army Gen.

The Guardian: Kayne West Has Come Out Against Vaccinations in US Presidential Bid,"Kanye West declares he’s serious about running for president. The 43-year-old rapper has given more details about his policy platform in the race to become the U.S. president in November.West, who said he may have contracted COVID-19 in February, opposes vaccines, calling them “the mark of the beast.” Regarding the development of a Covid-19 vaccine, he said: “It’s so many of our children that are being vaccinated and paralysed … So when they say the way we’re going to fix covid is with a vaccine, I’m extremely cautious. That’s the mark of the beast.“They want to put chips inside of us, they want to do all kinds of things to make it where we can’t cross the gates of heaven.”West proclaimed that he would run as a third-party candidate under the Birthday party, “because when we win it’s everybody’s birthday.” He added that Elon Musk is advising him, his campaign slogan will be “YES!” and his running mate will be a preacher named Michelle Tidball.Elon Musk Is Making Implants to Link the Brain With a SmartphoneThe husband of Kim Kardashian told Forbes that Trump is still “special” and the “closest president we’ve had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation,” adding: “I’m not saying Trump’s in my way, he may be a part of my way.

FDA Revokes Emergency Use of Hydroxychloroquine to Treat Coronavirus,"U.S. regulators on Monday revoked emergency authorization for malaria drugs promoted by President Donald Trump for treating COVID-19 amid growing evidence they don’t work and could cause serious side effects.The Food and Drug Administration said the drugs hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are unlikely to be effective in treating the coronavirus. Citing reports of heart complications, the FDA said the drugs’ unproven benefits “do not outweigh the known and potential risks.”The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.The move means that shipments of the drugs obtained by the federal government will no longer be distributed to state and local health authorities for use against the coronavirus. The drugs are still available for alternate uses, so U.S. doctors could still prescribe them for COVID-19 — a practice known as off-label prescribing.Dr. Steven Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic researcher who has been a frequent FDA adviser, agreed with the decision and said he would not have granted emergency access in the first place.“There has never been any high-quality evidence suggesting that hyrdoxychloroquine is effective” for treating or preventing coronavirus infection, he said, but there is evidence of serious side effects.On Thursday, a National Institutes of Health panel of experts revised its recommendations to specifically recommend against the drug’s use except in formal studies, and “that, I’m sure, had influence on the FDA,” Nissen said.The actions by FDA and NIH send a clear signal to health professionals against prescribing the drugs for coronavirus.Trump aggressively pushed the drug beginning in the first weeks of the outbreak and stunned medical professionals when he revealed he took the drug preemptively against infection.No large, rigorous studies have found the drugs safe or effective for preventing or treating COVID-19. And a string of recent studies made clear they could do more harm than good.The FDA granted emergency use of the drugs for coronavirus patients in late March at the same time the U.S. government accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine that had been donated by two foreign drug manufacturers. Millions of those doses were shipped to U.S. hospitals to treat patient who weren’t enrolled in clinical trials.But the FDA previously warned doctors that it had seen reports of dangerous side effects and heart problems reported to poison control centers and other health systems.The agency said Monday it revoked the authorization in consultation with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, which had requested the emergency use.BARDA’s former director said in April that he was removed from his job because he resisted political pressure from Trump appointees to allow widespread use of the malaria drugs. Rick Bright said he worked with FDA senior staff to limit the drugs’ authorization to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and under professional supervision.Among other issues, Bright objected to the fact that some of the doses imported by the U.S. government were manufactured at facilities in India and Pakistan that had not been reviewed by the FDA.The FDA says it sampled and tested the imported drugs to confirm they met the agency’s standards for safety and quality.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

World Health Organization Hires PR Firm to Find Celebrity Influencers to Counter Negative Publicity,"The World Health Organization has reached out to a high powered PR firm with the mission to find celebrity influencers who can sing the praises of the embattled United Nations agency and boost its public image.The U.S. halted its funding of the World Health Organization and officially withdrew from the agency on July 7 for its botched handling of the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. has been the largest funder of the WHO, with American taxpayers giving $400 million to $500 million to the organization each year.In May, the WHO signed a $135,000 contract with Hill + Knowlton Strategies to reach out to influencers of all genres, including celebrities with more than 1 million followers on social media, according to documents filed this week to the Justice Department. The filing complies with the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which requires the disclosure of lobbying and PR work by U.S. companies working for foreign entities.USA Today: Trump Announces ‘Halt’ in US Funding to World Health Organization Amid Coronavirus PandemicGates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeAccording to Breitbart, the filing from Hill + Knowlton included details that outlined a plan of action in its proposal:“There has been criticism and assertions leveled against the World Health Organization (WHO) and media coverage that could undermine WHO as a trusted and critical information source on global public health issues. (The objective is to) ensure there is trust in the WHO’s advice and that public health guidance is followed.”In addition to celebrity influencers, Hill + Knowlton said it would identify “microinfluencers” with smaller, niche followings and lesser-known people such as health experts who appear on news programs. The article noted:The WHO already has a slew of celebrity allies, some of whom participated in a benefit concert in April to raise money for the organization as well as coronavirus relief around the world.

LA Times: Los Angeles County ‘With All Certainty’ Will Keep Stay-at-Home Orders in Place Through July,"Los Angeles County’s stay-at-home orders will “with all certainty” be extended for the next three months, county Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer acknowledged during a Board of Supervisors meeting on Tuesday.Without issuing an official order, Ferrer said that the timeline would only change if there was a “dramatic change to the virus and tools at hand.” As other California regions have seen a decline in the number of reported infections and COVID-19-related deaths, L.A. County, the state’s most populous, continues to see growth on both fronts. Because of this, and in the absence of widely available therapeutic testing for the coronavirus or rapid at-home versions that would allow people to test themselves daily, it seems unlikely that restrictions would be completely eased. Ferrer said:“Our hope is that by using the data, we’d be able to slowly lift restrictions over the next three months.” Ferrer’s comments came soon after Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Congress that states that move too quickly to ease orders could trigger an outbreak. Fauci said a 14-day decline in cases is the major checkpoint that states should meet before reopening.CA SB 276 & SB 714 Signed in to Law by Gov. Newsom—Occupy Sacramento Press ConferenceIn L.A. County, confirmed cases and deaths have continued to rise, even though beaches in the county are scheduled to reopen on Wednesday, just days after the county lifted restrictions on hiking trails, parks, and golf courses and allowed curbside pickup at nonessential businesses. Mom, a Former Cop, Arrested on Miami Beach After She Walks Out Onto the Sand in Protest of Its ClosureHowever, Ferrer warned Tuesday that further loosening of the rules would be slow.Precisely how people can use the beach will be a huge adjustment. Face coverings will be required when not in the water, and sunbathing won’t be allowed. Only active recreation — surfing, running, walking, and swimming — will be allowed. Coolers, chairs, umbrellas, and any of the other accessories that typically brought to the beach should be left at home.Under pressure to reopen the economy, Gov. Gavin Newsom last week announced new protocols for retail stores and some workplaces to reopen.Under the plan, some in-restaurant dining, car washes, and shopping malls could also be allowed to reopen in coming weeks if public health officials in a county are able to demonstrate that the spread of the virus has stabilized and that they have adequate testing and hospital capacity.According to the LA Times, most large California counties are not close to meeting Newsom’s standards. The Times analyzed which counties could pass just the first two criteria — whether deaths have stopped in the last 14 days, and whether there is no more than one case per 10,000 residents in that same time period.Bill Gates – Most Dangerous Philanthropist in Modern History?Most of California failed that test. In fact, 95 percent of Californians live in counties that don’t meet that standard, and not a single county in Southern California nor the San Francisco Bay Area met the criteria.Newsom recently suggested that the guidelines would be later modified on a statewide basis, allowing larger counties hit hardest by the outbreak to also reopen more broadly. He said:“Over the next few weeks, we’ll be making subsequent announcements for the entire state, not just those that meet those more restrictive criteria.”More than 240,000 of L.A. County’s 10 million residents have been checked for the virus and roughly 12% — more than 32,000 — have been infected. Officials have been encouraging all residents, even those without symptoms, to get tested. They indicated that social distancing has helped slow the spread of the virus but also warn that it remains contagious. Ferrer reminded residents on Monday:“It’s safer to stay at home. COVID-19 has not changed.” ",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Forbes Says Future Air Travel Will Be Four Hour Process with Self Check-In Disinfection and Immunity Passes,"Once airports and borders open again and people are able to fly freely — a process already in play as airports of all sizes around the world ready strategies to ensure healthy air travel — how much are you ready to change your flying habits?As much as was required after 9/11? Less? More?Considering some of the changes already happening and the many more recommended before airports can reopen safely to commercial routes, experts are referring to the coronavirus pandemic as ‘the new terrorism,’ triggering the biggest crisis the airline industry has ever faced.Let’s start with the entire process of checking in for flights, which some calculate could take up to four hours and involve social distancing, sanitation of passengers and luggage, wider spaces for various lines and waiting to board.Nine out of 10 experts expect slower turnarounds between flights due to the need of thorough cleaning of cabins and following of sanitary measures at airports.In the short run, though, it’s expected that reduced passenger numbers and airlines traveling to a smaller pool of destinations may reduce delays.American Airlines workers bring class action saying material in new gray uniforms made them sickA person walks through a near empty John F. Kennedy Airport where some national and international … [+] flights are still departing and arriving, although many have been cancelled due to a lack of passengers and restrictions on global travel.The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom” by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna TachoverAmong the steps under consideration: no cabin bags, no lounges, no automatic upgrades, face masks, surgical gloves, self-check-in, self-bag-drop-off, immunity passports, on-the-spot blood tests and sanitation disinfection tunnels.Digital technologies and automation will play a critical role in the future of air travel. The need to reduce “touchpoints” at airports implies mandatory use of biometric boarding that allows passengers to board planes with only their face as a passport.A number of airlines including British Airways, Qantas and EasyJet already are using the technology.According to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), “the ‘new normal’ at major airports, such as Heathrow, JFK and Singapore Changi will include almost exclusive use of online check-ins, and contactless payments.Then there are the radical changes the airports will have to make starting most probably with stopping non-fliers from entering at all except for unaccompanied minors or others who need assistance.They will need more extensive all-biometric check-in systems and efficient DYI for dropping off bags, ‘travel bubbles,’ or tunnels for disinfection. (After being checked in, luggage may also be put through a disinfection fogging tunnel.) They also must install demarcation of the spaces for social distancing in corridors and concourses, larger spaces for queues and waiting, plexiglass or other protective barriers at customer service counters, hand sanitation stations and thermal scanning to check crowds for fever-grade body temperatures, which already are in use in some major airports.Bill Gates’ Philanthropy: 30,000 Indian girls used as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccine“Only those ‘fit to fly’ will be allowed to enter,” predicts the airline strategy firm SimpliFlying, in a recent report, where it identifies more than 70 different areas in the passenger journey that “are expected to either change or to be introduced from scratch, including having bags ‘sanitagged’ after going through fogging, electrostatic or UV-disinfection to restore confidence in flying after COVID-19.”The Telegraph explains that “it may sound futuristic, but UV sanitation is likely to become commonplace at the world’s airports. London Heathrow says it is to begin trialling the process for its security trays.”The boarding process is expected also to become ‘touchless,’ with options including facial recognition, already used in some U.S. airports for international flights. On the planes, there will be blocked seats, electrostatic spraying, personnel in protective gear and, of course, masks. Major European carriers such as Air France and KLM already have made them compulsory and it’s expected that all other airlines will do the same.As for food, the tendency is to stop serving altogether on short-haul flights, while the airlines consider ‘light refreshments’ for long-haul flights. Hong Kong Airlines has decided to stop offering food altogether.At the arrival point, SimpliFlying forecasts, international passengers will need to show some type of immunity document/passport, also advocated by the International Air Transport Association, IATA, to border control agents. Once a vaccine has been found, that could shift to a proof of vaccination.“Arriving passengers will also undergo another temperature screening at their final destination and potentially even blood tests for COVID-19,” Conde Nast predicts. “Some airports like Hong Kong and Vienna are testing passengers for the coronavirus with a blood test before they are allowed to enter the country. Those types of tests, however, might be short-lived.”Thermal testing is also recommended by IATA, “while Airlines UK, which represents British Airways, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic, has said ‘pre-screening’ of travelers should be introduced ideally as early in the passenger journey as possible,” reports The Telegraph. Although there are no standard decisions about making such tests and screening mandatory, airports and airlines are pushing for uniform regulations. It’s not clear who will be responsible for checking travelers’ temperatures and other Covid-19 symptoms, for example.SimpliFlying predicts that a new federal health agency likely will be created to coordinate health screenings inside airports.As immediately following 9/11, a process of trial-and-error is likely, with many airports and airlines following what some ‘pioneers’ establish.“There will be new protocols for check-in involving digital technology; hand sanitizer stations at frequent points including where luggage is stored; contactless payment instead of cash; using stairs more often than lifts where the two-meter-rule can be harder to maintain; and fitness equipment being moved for greater separation, among other examples,” the WTTC wrote in a recent report.The international institution says that the sector will face a gradual return to travel over the coming months as a “new normal” emerges before a vaccine becomes available on a mass scale, large enough to inoculate billions of people.30 Million Dead: Bill Gates Sees a Genetically Engineered Bioweapon Triggering the Next Global PandemicTravel is likely to return first to domestic markets with “staycations,” then to a country’s nearest neighbors before expanding across regions, and then finally across continents to welcome the return of journeys to long-haul international destinations. WTTC believes that younger travelers in the 18-35 age group, who appear to be less vulnerable to COVID-19, also may be among the first to begin traveling again.According to Gloria Guevara, WTTC President & CEO, traveling in the ‘new normal’ age requires coordinated actions, including new standards and protocols, “for a safe and responsible road to recovery for the global Travel & Tourism sector as consumers start planning trips again.”The new protocols and standards are being defined following feedback from associations representing the different travel sectors including International Air Transport Association (IATA), the Airport Council International (ACI), Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), United States Travel Association (USTA), Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Travel Commission (ETC) and the World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO).But with protocols and standards, biometric systems, immunity passports and the best intentions for a safe road to recovery, the future of traveling, as New York Times’s Niraj Chokshi explains, is still bleak: “With much of the world closed for business, and no widely available vaccine in sight, it may be months, if not years, before airlines operate as many flights as they did before the crisis. Even when people start flying again, the industry could be transformed, much as it was after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.”And in the process, as it is already the case, some airlines, especially smaller ones, will be push into bankruptcy or become takeover targets. “Consumer fears about catching the virus on crowded planes could lead to reconfigured seating. Carriers may initially entice wary travelers with discounts, but if they can’t fill up flights, they may resort to raising ticket prices.”For Dave CalhounIn, CEO of Boeing, not only are the smaller airlines in danger. He thinks that at least a major U.S carrier will “most likely” go out of business due to the coronavirus pandemic. In an interview with NBC News’ TODAY, on Tuesday he told Savannah Guthrie: “…something will happen when September comes around. Traffic levels will not be back to 100%. They won’t even be back to 25%. Maybe by the end of the year we approach 50%. So there will definitely be adjustments that have to be made on the part of the airlines.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: 27 National Guards Will be Going to the Largest Nursing Home in the US with Large Outbreak,"Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, Beaver County’s largest nursing home, will now get support from the Pennsylvania National Guard to deal with its outbreak of COVID-19. Twenty-seven members of the Guard began training Monday morning to help facility workers.Brighton Rehab is the site of the worst outbreak of the novel coronavirus in the state and one of the largest in the country, according to reports. As of Sunday afternoon, state data indicates that 319 residents had tested positive for COVID-19, including 71 who have died. At least 22 employees also have tested positive. About 70 percent of Beaver County’s positive cases and 91 percent of deaths in people with the virus are linked to the facility. The administrators said in a statement:“Throughout this unprecedented crisis, we have called on the state to provide us with the critical resources we needed to combat this virus. We are grateful for the support and partnership of the National Guard and are confident that, together, we can protect our community.”Washington Examiner: Fauci Warns Certain Coronavirus Vaccinations Could ‘Enhance the Negative Effect of the Infection’NY POST: Spanish Official Apologizes for Trying to Disinfect Beach with BleachAdministrators said the Guard will help with general housekeeping tasks including cleaning, meal preparation and service, and daily living support like bathing and feeding, adding:“While we continue to make positive strides in our efforts to control and prevent the further spread of COVID-19, support from the National Guard will allow our facility to get much-needed relief by permitting our nurses and aides to redirect their time and attention to the increasing health needs of our residents.”Nate Wardle, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, said Sunday morning that the National Guard will be in place until May 18. He said:“The facility has contracted to bring in additional nursing support from Texas beginning May 18. At that point the Guard will exit the facility. There will be a one-day hand-off between the National Guard and the additional nurse staffing.”State officials said Friday they intended to put a state-funded, full-time manager in place at the facility. State officials said that more information on that plan would be announced soon.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

NYT: It Has Come to This: Ignore the C.D.C.,"Harold Varmus, former director of the National Institutes of Health and former co-chair of President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, and Rajiv Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, have spoken.We were shocked upon reading the piece in The New York Times published by none other than this powerful pair. Their article states: We were startled and dismayed last week to learn that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a perplexing series of statements, had altered its testing guidelines to reduce the testing of asymptomatic people for the coronavirus.These changes by the C.D.C. will undermine efforts to end the pandemic, slow the return to normal economic, educational and social activities, and increase the loss of lives.1RFK Jr. Sues Facebook, Zuckerberg and ‘Fact-Checkers’ for Vaccine CensorshipLike other public health experts and scientists, they have argued that more asymptomatic people, not fewer, need to be tested to bring the pandemic under control. Now, in the face of a dysfunctional C.D.C., they believe it’s up to states, other institutions, and individuals to act. The article states:Understanding what needs to be done requires understanding the different purposes of testing. Much of the current testing is diagnostic. People should get tested if they have symptoms — respiratory distress, loss of smell, fever. There is no argument about this testing, and the altered C.D.C. guidelines do not affect it.But under its revised guidelines, the C.D.C. seeks to dissuade people who are asymptomatic from being tested. Yet this group poses both the greatest threat to pandemic control and the greatest opportunity to bring the pandemic to an end. It is with this group that our country has failed most miserably.1The article says that tests can reduce the number of people who need to be isolated, but only for as long as they are shown to be infected. If those tests were to be performed frequently (even daily) and widely (even universally), it is almost certain that the pandemic would evaporate in just a few weeks. But without tests or a highly effective vaccine, the only sure way to prevent further spread of the virus would be to isolate everyone from everyone else. In theory, this would work, but it is untenable — if not impossible — because of the economic and social consequences of shutdowns. FOX: Cobb County man tests positive and negative for COVID-19 just hours apartThey suggest we consider the logic, adding that because that much diagnostic testing is not feasible (given the costs and logistics, as well as the likelihood that some would refuse to comply), it makes sense to modulate the approach by testing those who are at greatest risk of infection, and those who are most likely to spread the virus if they become infected. According to the Times, some new methods have already been authorized for use by the FDA. The Department of Health and Human Services has also committed to purchasing large quantities of antigen tests.These are practical and essential actions that need to be taken now. In the absence of sensible guidance from the C.D.C., what can the country do to control the pandemic? The article urges at least three actions. They are: We commend Harold Varmus and Rajiv Shah for their thought-provoking piece, which they end with:",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
CBS: Mother Finds Fake Facebook Ad Claiming Her Family Died From Coronavirus,"A shocked mother discovered a photo of her family in a Facebook video for a face mask that declared most of the family members pictured had died of COVID-19.The image, a professional photo of the Ancich family taken for a holiday card eight years ago, reportedly appeared in a Facebook ad for a company selling face masks called FilterMax.Mother Sara Ancich said that she was overwhelmed with Facebook messages from concerned family members and friends after the video appeared. The video claimed that the family became victims of the coronavirus pandemic after attending a church service. It said that all but the youngest son had died of COVID-19. Ancich added:“Who would have the audacity to clearly not know a family and type that they had died? It’s on the forefront of everybody’s mind in the news and everything and how quickly it is taking lives. It could so, so clearly be true to people.”Newsweek: Facebook Announces It Will Not Be Submitting Content From Politicians To Independent Fact CheckingWashington Post: New York Announces Antitrust Investigation into Facebook, Kicking off Multistate EffortThe video describes a teenager’s survival as a result of the face mask. The teen is falsely identified as a member of the Ancich family.Facebook has since removed the ad, of which there were numerous versions. The company says to crack down on businesses taking advantage of fear during the coronavirus pandemic, it has banned all ads having to do with face masks, hand sanitizer, wipes, and COVID-19 tests.Ancich says she hasn’t posted the photo on social media in years. She noted that a reverse image search on Google reveals the picture is on several Pinterest boards for examples of family photos. She tried reporting the video to Facebook, but it kept popping up in her feed. She added:“It was upsetting. It’s violating.

BREAKING: The Guardian: Doctors in South Korea Call for Flu Shot to be Paused After 25 Deaths,"In South Korea, authorities are investigating the mysterious deaths of at least 25 people after being vaccinated against seasonal influenza. And though officials said there was no link between the deaths and the vaccinations, there was worry that the cases could cause panic at a critical time for vaccination efforts.The deaths happened over the past week. Officials gave no other details but to say that two of the deaths might have resulted from anaphylactic shock, a serious allergic reaction.The deaths are under investigation, but officials quickly ruled out the vaccines themselves as the main cause. Officials indicated the shots were all from local drugmakers and not from lots for export. Given South Korea’s flu vaccination program’s scope and the small number of other problems reported so far, some experts said that coincidence is more likely to be involved.Two Types of People Who Should Never Get the Flu ShotInstead, officials vowed to step up a government flu-vaccination campaign to prevent the country’s health care system from being overloaded with flu patients amid the coronavirus pandemic — both viruses have similar symptoms of early infection, like fever and cough. Jung Eun-kyeong, commissioner of the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency, said:“We have not found a direct connection between these deaths and vaccines, or a relationship between the deaths and adverse effects reported after flu shots. We don’t think that the situation calls for the suspending of the inoculation program.”On Wednesday, Mrs. Jung assembled a special news conference after the rapid series of deaths grabbed headlines in South Korea, beginning with a teenager who died on Friday. But with autopsies likely to take days, public anxiety runs high in a country where anti-vaccine sentiment has flared before.BREAKING: Reuters: Volunteer in AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine Trial DiesSouth Korea, and many other countries, have seen annual flu immunization programs as crucial to efforts to also deal with the coronavirus, especially for children, the elderly, pregnant women, and medical personnel. Officials unveiled plans to procure 20 percent more flu vaccines for this winter than last year to inoculate up to 30 million people, more than half the country’s population.But the campaign made headlines last month when it was discovered that some vaccines supplied by a local company, which needed to be refrigerated at all times, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported. ​ A recall was ordered, and officials said about 2,300 people had received doses from the faulty batch meant mainly for young children and teenagers.Still, officials said that alone should not have rendered the vaccines dangerous. According to the CDC, the concern about lack of temperature control is that it can render the vaccines ineffective rather than toxic.Then, earlier this month, 615,000 doses of a flu vaccine​ shipped by another company were also recalled after some of them were found to contain white particles, which the government described as being a harmless protein. Almost 18,000 people had received doses before they were recalled.No serious harm had been reported from either of those lots, though dozens of people who received those doses reported fevers or other minor complaints — which are common reactions to flu shots, officials said. They added that none of nine people who died had received vaccines from those that had been recalled.FOX: Man Dies of Flu After Getting Flu Shot, Local Officials Respond by Saying Still Get Your Flu ShotAfter suspending the vaccination program for teenagers for three weeks, it resumed on October 13. Three days later, a 17-year-old boy in Incheon, just west of Seoul, died after receiving his shot. On Tuesday, a 77-year-old woman was found dead at her home in Gochang, south of Seoul, after being vaccinated a day earlier. On the same day, an 82-year-old man who had also been inoculated died in the central city of Daejeon.Four of the five people who died on Wednesday ranged in age from 53 to 89. Information about the two other people who died has not been released. Officials said nine of those who died, all of whom had received flu shots in the past, received vaccines supplied by several different local drugmakers. Kim Joong-gon, ​a professor of medicine at Seoul National University who led a team of investigators, said:“Since most people who got flu shots with the same vaccines reported no major problems, we concluded that those vaccines do not contain toxic materials. We​ concluded that we can exclude ​the vaccine ​as a problem.”​Officials said that since 2009, twenty-five people in South Korea had died after receiving flu vaccinations, but only one of the deaths was tied to the process.Nearly 13 million South Koreans have received flu shots this year, 8.3 million of them for free as part of the government program. There have been complaints about minor reactions to shots, but those are normal every flu season. And Ms. Jung said that some of the complaints were likely to have been influenced by media coverage of the recalls.The anxiety over flu shots could also undermine public trust in an eventual coronavirus vaccine, which is already faltering as countries race to get their candidates approved. In a survey this month of 2,500 people in Gyeonggi-do, a populous province surrounding the South Korean capital of Seoul, 62 percent of respondents said they would not get vaccinated against the coronavirus until after the vaccine was proved to be completely safe.Kim Myung-suk, 65, is among a growing number of South Koreans who decided to pay for a vaccine of their choice, despite being eligible for a free dose. She told Reuters:“Though just a few people died so far, the number is growing and that makes me uneasy. So I’m getting a shot somewhere else and will pay for it.”The New York Times vs. the science on the Flu ShotMost vaccines have to be kept at low temperatures from the time they are manufactured to the time they are administered to prevent them from spoiling — what the industry calls a “cold chain.” The flu vaccine, for example, needs to stay refrigerated at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. That could complicate the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine. A number of the leading candidates under development would need to be kept at temperatures as low as minus 112 degrees Fahrenheit.Transportation and warehouse companies are rushing to build “freezer farms” in the United States. Airlines are fitting their planes with freezers, and glass vial makers are coming up with ways to make vials that do not crack from frigid temperatures. Courier services like UPS and FedEx are making dry ice. However, cold facilities are not readily available in other parts of the world, including Central America, rural India, and Southeast Asia, which experts say could hinder mass immunization.Typically, multiple reports of adverse reactions from vaccines are investigated by a country’s drug regulator to determine the frequency of such events and whether there are causal links. While these investigations are underway, countries can choose to continue the vaccination program if the benefits are thought to outweigh the risks.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"According to local officials, FEMA Facility Will No Longer Be Used as Coronavirus Quarantine Center","Editor’s note: Update. Since we reported on the national news story that coronavirus patients would be housed at a FEMA camp in the state of Alabama, local elected officials have announced this will, in fact, not happen after all.  Locals (along with politicians) stated they didn’t want these infected people housed at FEMA camps in their states. Alabama Senator Shelby, Governor Kay Ivey and Congressman Mike Rogers (AL-03) have all  tweeted that they have respectively spoken with the president over the phone on Sunday afternoon. In those phone calls, Trump reportedly affirmed that the patients will not be coming to Alabama. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced on Saturday that American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan would be quarantined at the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama.Passengers who will stay at the Alabama federal facility have tested positive for the coronavirus (COVID-19) but are not currently showing symptoms. If they become seriously ill, they will be taken to pre-vetted hospitals for medical care. The patients are expected to be transported to the facility this week.FOX: California Lab Says it Discovered Coronavirus Vaccine in 3 HoursNovel Coronavirus — The Latest Pandemic ScareRead the entire HHS statement below:HHS is taking precautions to protect the health of all Americans from Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). To that end, HHS and FEMA agreed to use a federal facility, the FEMA Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Alabama, as a place for some of the American passengers from the Diamond Princess to stay. These are passengers whom the federal government evacuated back to the U.S. from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan.The passengers who will stay at the Center tested positive for COVID-19, although at this time they either do not have symptoms or have mild flu-like symptoms. Any of the evacuees who become seriously ill will be transported to pre-identified hospitals for medical care. Under the HHS-FEMA agreement, the Center for Domestic Preparedness will provide the housing, and HHS will provide basic medical care and all other support services for these returning passengers. Passengers will stay in a separate area from the Center’s training participants and will remain at the Center until they are medically cleared.1The Center has unique facilities and routinely offers week-long, hands-on training for large groups of professionals from federal, state and local emergency management agencies, hospitals, public health agencies, and law enforcement agencies on disaster response.FEMA’s Center for Domestic Preparedness (CDP) in Anniston is one of the country’s most advanced training sites for health and medical education in disasters.

"New York Times: CDC Labs Were Contaminated, Delaying US Coronavirus Testing, Officials Say","There are three Centers for Disease Control and Prevention labs in Atlanta that created the nation’s first coronavirus test kits. Two of them violated their own manufacturing standards. Because of their sloppy error, the agency initially sent out tests that did not work to almost ALL of the 100 state and local public health labs, according to the FDA.The FDA, which oversees laboratory tests, sent Dr. Timothy Stenzel, chief of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health, early on to the CDC labs to evaluate the problem, according to officials. What Dr. Stenzel found was startling. He discovered a lack of expertise in commercial manufacturing and realized that nobody was in charge of the entire process. According to the New York Times:Problems ranged from researchers entering and exiting the coronavirus laboratories without changing their coats, to test ingredients being assembled in the same room where researchers were working on positive coronavirus samples, officials said. Those practices made the tests sent to public health labs unusable because they were contaminated with the coronavirus, and produced some inconclusive results.Flu Misinformation and Coronavirus Fears: My Letter to Dr. Sanjay GuptaThe CDC, forced to suspend the launch of a nationwide detection program for the coronavirus, lost credibility as the nation’s top public health agency, and the country lost ground in ways that continue to slow down testing. On Saturday, FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomoa said in a statement:“(the) CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol.”The FDA confirmed its conclusions late this week after various media outlets demanded public disclosure of its inquiry, which admittedly is part of a more extensive federal investigation into the CDC lab irregularities by the Department of Health and Human Services.Health experts, along with Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the CDC, have long hinted that contamination in the labs might have been the culprit. However, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes asserted that it was still just a possibility and that the agency was waiting for the official findings of HHS. He did admit that the CDC’s quality control measures were inadequate during the coronavirus test development. Since then, he said:“(the) CDC implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing the issue moving forward.”From the onset of the pandemic, the CDC was responsible for creating a coronavirus test that state and local public health agencies could use to diagnose COVID-19 in people, and then isolate them to prevent the spread of the disease.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeScott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said of the CDC’s failing:“It was just tragic. All that time when we were sitting there waiting, I really felt like, here we were at one of the most critical junctures in public health history, and the biggest tool in our toolbox was missing.”Becker said that on February 7, public health laboratories started receiving the CDC kits. By the next day, members were already calling him to advise that the test was not working correctly. He informed both the CDC and the FDA, which regulates medical devices, including laboratory tests. Becker said:“This is consistent with what we said was plausible when we found the problem at the beginning. When we found the problem, it seemed to our community that it was a contamination issue that would cause a problem to this extent.”The FDA concluded that CDC manufacturing problems were the culprit and pushed the agency to move production to an outside firm. That company, IDT, expedited production of the CDC test, and no more issues have been reported.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"CBS: Fairgrounds Around U.S. Being Converted Into Detention Centers, One Arrested for Trying to Escape","Cities around the country are converting their fairgrounds into make-shift quarantine/detention centers to house coronavirus patients who are homeless.One such city is Nashville, Tennessee, where the fairgrounds are being used by the city in an attempt to quash an outbreak among homeless residents. Dr. Alex Jahangir, chairman of the city’s coronavirus task force, said everyone who has tested positive can be ordered into quarantine. He added:“Everyone is entitled to come and go as they want, typically, but in the fairgrounds situation we wanted to make sure that people who are positive stayed in the ill parts of the shelter — period.”1Jahangir said the vast majority of people who tested positive in Nashville have cooperated with officials, so “formal quarantines” have been unnecessary. However, the city has the option of using a legally enforceable quarantine order whenever necessary, and recently had to do so after a COVID-19 patient jumped a fence and fled the Nashville Fairgrounds.Health officials informed the man he could not leave until he was cleared, but he jumped a fence and left anyway, according to the arrest affidavit, which was the first of its kind in the city. The man was stopped and arrested by Metro Nashville Parks police by a city cemetery nearly two miles from where he had been quarantined.The arrest highlights the difference between citizens advised to remain at home and those ordered into quarantine. The mayor of Nashville has instructed residents to stay home as much as possible. However, those who test positive for coronavirus can be ordered into quarantine, which police can enforce.This California Farm Helps The Homeless Get Off The StreetsIn addition to Nashville, commissioners in Palm Beach County, Florida unanimously approved a plan to shelter the homeless in the old Palm Beach County Detention Center near the South Florida Fairgrounds.Residents in the area sounded off, expressing frustration at being left out of the conversation. One such resident, Blair English, said:“We are worried about having up to 125 homeless people right down the road from us.”2Meet the Veterinarian Walking Around the Streets of California and Treating Homeless Peoples’ Animals for FreeCounty leaders say the old detention center is a safe place for the homeless to lay their heads. They’ll have access to job training and medical care. Palm Beach County Mayor Dave Kerner added:“When folks come to the county commission and say ‘I don’t want this person in my backyard,’ well they are not going to be in your backyard. But they are in other people’s backyard right now and they are not being well taken care of by the government and that’s not acceptable.”2Palm Beach County leaders made it very clear that people who opt out of using the shelter won’t be allowed to continue camping at parks, while advocates for the homeless feel for the plan to work, it’s going to come down to how it’s presented to the people who will use it.Homeless resident David Thorton Jr., like dozens of others living in tents at John Prince Park, says he’s thrilled to hear about the access to resources to help him get back on his feet, but he’s not completely sold on the plan. He said:“If it looks like a jail… I feel like they are just trying to lock up the homeless because they think that we are lower than scum. I understand that it’s not meant to be [a] luxurious thing, but if it’s like a jail that’s kind of pointless. It’s making us look like we are ex-cons and stuff.”2",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Wales Going Into Lockdown: A Two Household Christmas Limit to Become Law,"People in Wales will be ordered to limit Christmas gatherings to two households ahead of a new lockdown starting on December 28. The country is tightening coronavirus rules and will move to its highest tier of restrictions – level 4 – equivalent to a lockdown.For those not aware, Wales has a population of 3.2 million people. And that’s a lot of people. The Welsh government will also put new guidance for only two households to mix as part of a “Christmas bubble” during a five-day period into law.This is despite Prime Minister Boris Johnson using a Downing Street news conference to state there had been “collective” agreement among the UK’s nations to keep Christmas COVID rules – which had allowed bubbles of three households – the same in law.Herald Sun: Police Guarding 3,000 Residents as Public Housing Towers Forced into LockdownOn Wednesday, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford announced that all non-essential retail, leisure, and fitness centers in Wales will shut at the close of trading on Christmas Eve. He added that hospitality premises will shut from 6 pm on Christmas Day as Wales tries to tackle a “sustained rise in coronavirus.”The level 4 rules will begin on 28 December for an initial three-week period. Non-essential retail, hospitality businesses, close contact services, and all leisure and fitness centers must stay closed. Social contact outside households or support bubbles – whether indoors or outdoors – is not allowed. People must also stay at home if possible and not travel without a reasonable excuse.Variety: Legends Eric Clapton, Van Morrison Team Up for Anti-Lockdown Single “Stand and Deliver”Mr. Drakeford this week joined talks with the leaders of the other devolved nations over the festive loosening of COVID rules. He told reporters:“The clear message from the Welsh government is that only two households should meet. Whether that’s guidance or regulation the message is the same – only two households should get together.”Meanwhile, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also deviated from the initial UK-wide plan. She recommended that those people forming a Christmas bubble should only meet on one day, instead of five, and not stay overnight “unless it is unavoidable”. She said:“Firstly and unequivocally the safest way to spend Christmas this year for you and for those you love is to stay within your own household and your own home. My strong recommendation is this is what you should do if at all possible.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
FOX: DeSantis: Former Manager of Coronavirus Dashboard “Not a Data Scientist;” Faces Cyber-Stalking Charge,"Florida’s governor says the woman who was in charge of the state’s COVID-19 dashboard has active criminal cases against her, suggesting her claims of data manipulation were just being amplified by those looking for a “boogeyman.”Rebekah Jones, a geospatial scientist formerly with the state Department of Health, reportedly told several media outlets she was asked to remove data showing that COVID-19 patients first reported symptoms earlier than state officials originally announced. She claimed that when she refused to “manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen,” she was given the choice to resign or be fired.Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday he did not know Jones, but he insisted her termination was over her “insubordination” — not over any refusal to alter state data.During a press conference Wednesday afternoon with Vice President Mike Pence, DeSantis went further, disputing nearly every claim Jones made in recent interviews.“One, she is not a data scientist. She is somebody that’s got a degree in journalism, communication and geography. She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that, she is not an epidemiologist, she is not the chief architect of our web portal. That is another false statement,” the governor said. “She was putting data on the portal, which the scientists didn’t believe was valid data. So, she didn’t listen to people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. And so then she was dismissed because of that.”Then, DeSantis said Jones is under “active criminal charges” in Florida, which includes cyber-stalking and cyber-sexual harassment.“I have a zero-tolerance policy for sexual harassment,” the governor said, adding that he was asking the Department of Health to explain how she had remained employed despite the charges.Records in the Leon County Clerk of Court website show Rebekah Jones was involved in cases matching what the governor said. In October 2017 and in June 2019, a temporary injunction for stalking was filed against her in Leon County. Those cases are closed.In July 2019, a stalking case was filed by the state of Florida against Jones. The case remains open.FOX 13 has reached out to Jones, but we have not heard back.FOX 13 asked the governor’s office what questionable data Jones was putting online and his spokesperson offered this reply:“Rebeka [sic] Jones acted as if she had ownership of the Department of Health Dashboard website and disregarded the direction given to her by subject matter experts such as the Senior Epidemiologists, Senior Data Analysts and supervisors.  She was resistant to publishing data on the website she disagreed with going against the judgement of the epidemiologists, senior data analysts and supervisors.  Event Date is a field that can be queried on the dashboard that marks the beginning of the epidemiological investigation which is based on self-reporting of information that is not medically certified.  The science and public health experts believe the best information is the actual clinical diagnosis of the disease verified by COVID-19 diagnostic testing,” Helen Aguirre Ferre wrote.Meanwhile, some Democratic senators began demanding an investigation into Jones’ claims about data manipulation after her claims got national attention Tuesday.“We are making public policy decisions based on that information,” state Sen. Lori Berman of Boynton Beach said. “If it is being falsified, we need to know that.”“Our data is available. Our data is transparent. Any insinuation otherwise is just typical partisan narrative,” DeSantis countered Wednesday, pointing to Florida’s comparatively low mortality rate.“We’ve succeeded and I think that people just don’t want to recognize it because it challenges their narrative, it challenges their assumption. So they gotta try and find a boogeyman,” he added. “Maybe it’s that there are black helicopters circling the Department of Health. If you believe that, I’ve got a bridge in Brooklyn I’d like to sell you.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

Variety: AMC Will Open Next Month and Says All Patrons Will Be Required to Wear Masks,"The largest movie theater chain in the world, AMC Theatres, has revealed plans to re-open after the coronavirus forced its closure nearly four months ago. The company closed its more than 600 U.S. venues and is expected to resume operations in 450 of those locations on July 15. It plans to be almost fully operational by the time Disney’s “Mulan” debuts on July 24 and Warner Bros.’ “Tenet” bows on July 31.As part of their re-opening, AMC is reducing its seating capacity to help people social distance. It is implementing new cleaning procedures, placing hand-sanitizing stations throughout its theaters, and encouraging contact-less and cash-free concessions. AMC CEO and president Adam Aron said in an interview with Variety:“We didn’t rush to reopen. There were some jurisdictions in some states, such as Georgia and Texas, that allowed people to reopen theaters in mid-May. We opted to remain closed, so we could give the country time to get a better handle on coronavirus. We wanted to use this time to figure out how best to open and how to do so safely.”Regal and Cinemark, AMC’s competitors, announced their own plans to resume business earlier this week, targeting a similar mid-July timeframe for when they expect to be fully operational.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeMovie theaters are under pressure to bring customers back to cinemas. Before the coronavirus, there was a large amount of consolidation in the industry, mostly the result of debt financing. AMC confirmed in recent filings that the coronavirus pandemic could push it into bankruptcy. Aron expressed confidence that the theater chain would be able to avoid Chapter 11 and would be able to have enough revenue to service its debt obligations, stating:“In my heart of hearts, I think we can manage AMC through this crisis. There are no guarantees and nobody knows what coronavirus will look like in the winter or how long it will take to get a vaccine, but I can tell you that we have a very able management team here. We’re going to make every effort to make sure that AMC continues to be well positioned as a leader of the movie theater industry.”Upon opening, employees will have to wear masks, but AMC will not mandate that guests must do so. The company will sell masks for a dollar to guests who need one. No temperature checks will be performed on customers, but it will monitor employees’ temperatures and have them undergo screenings to check for signs of coronavirus. The situation will be different in states and cities that require residents to wear a mask when they’re in public, but Aron said that AMC was cautious of wading into a public health issue that has become politicized, adding:“We did not want to be drawn into a political controversy. We thought it might be counterproductive if we forced mask wearing on those people who believe strongly that it is not necessary. We think that the vast majority of AMC guests will be wearing masks. When I go to an AMC feature, I will certainly be wearing a mask and leading by example.”The Times: Coronavirus May Vanish Too Fast for Vaccine TrialBoth Cinemark and Regal plan to encourage guests to wear masks, but will not require it in states and areas where they are not mandated.AMC has partnered with The Clorox Company, and current and former faculty of Harvard University’s School of Public Health to establish and implement new procedures. It will also clean auditoriums between each showtime and allow extra time between screenings for disinfection. The company will also block out every other row of seats to reduce congestion, encourage guests to use online ticketing and kiosks to limit interactions with staff, and designate various points within theaters for one-way foot traffic.With plans to increase capacity in its theaters in stages, AMC says it hopes to be able to have half of its auditoriums full by Labor Day and projects that it will be at full capacity by Thanksgiving. ",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus Outbreak,"New York state governor Andrew Cuomo announced today that the state is making its own hand sanitizer product in an attempt to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus which has currently infected over 100,000 people worldwide, resulting in around 3,800 deaths so far. Cuomo indicated the move is also to circumvent price-gouging of hand sanitizer. He claimed that the product is superior to others available due to a 75% alcohol content, greater than many other brands on the market. He said in a press briefing:“We are introducing New York State clean hand sanitizer, made conveniently by the state of New York.”The product is manufactured by Corcraft Products, which is run by the Department of Correctional Services, Division of Industries. The state plans to make 100,000 gallons per week using labor from inmates of New York’s prison system. According to their website, the organization claims to “employ inmates in substantive jobs that help teach a good work ethic and valuable work skills.”As of Monday, New York State confirmed 142 cases of COVID-19, with most focused in the Westchester region of the state. New York declared a state of emergency on Saturday, when the number of people with confirmed COVID-19 was 89. According to Governor Cuomo, 8 of the 142 cases are currently hospitalized.I use and highly recommend Air Doctor. AirDoctor is the affordable prescription for healthy, clean indoor air.

"Updated Every Minute, 17-Year-Old Whiz Kid’s Coronavirus Site Used by Millions","A Seattle teenager has built a website that is keeping the world updated on the COVID-19 pandemic as it spreads. The site has been visited by 12 million people since it launched in late December.Computer whiz Avi Schiffmann, 17, spends much of his time these days continually updating and improving his website, ncov2019.live, which automatically scrapes data from reliable sources from around the world. The site, which initially updated every ten minutes, now updates every minute to provide the latest statistics on the number of confirmed cases, severe cases, deaths, and recovered. And it does so in real-time both worldwide and in each country. FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus OutbreakThe site also hosts an interactive Google map, a Twitter feed, travel advisories, information on the disease and its prevention, as well as tips for preparing for quarantine situations. Schiffman, a high school junior said:“I started working on this project at Christmastime, when there were fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases — all in mainland China. It was hard to get clear, concise, and accurate information on what was going on, and I wanted to do something to fix this.”Schiffmann undertook this project because it allowed him to learn web scraping technology. He said:“It would also be a way to help with global health, which is something that’s needed when not all governments are the nicest or transparent, and it is hard to get information.”Schiffmann’s website scrapes information from official government health organizations (local, national, and international), and trustworthy news outlets. He relies on an online community of news curators to help with this. He also coded the website to crosscheck data to make sure it is accurate, explaining:“It’s all automated, so I don’t have to input anything manually. The web scraper runs even when I’m sleeping.”Schiffman said he is getting 1,000 messages a day, ranging from PhDs with suggestions to media outlets hoping for an interview. Planned improvements to ncov2019.live include regional statistical breakdowns, graphs comparing the COVID-19 outbreak to historical pandemics, a vaccine tracker, and translation of the site to 30 different languages.The English site has been visited online by every country on earth, with less than half from the United States.  As word has spread, the site has grown exponentially. It took a month to reach the first million, but in just the past 24 hours alone the site was visited by 3.2 million people. INDEPENDENT: Coronavirus: Space Images Reveal Drastic Fall in Pollution Over China as Factories ClosedThe teenager hopes to become a serial entrepreneur.

I’m not interested in imitating anyone else. I want to be the next Avi Schiffmann.I use coding like a painter uses a paintbrush. I like the technical aspect, but it’s a creative medium for me.

He also loves traveling and skis competitively.NY Post: North Korean Official Reportedly Executed for Breaking Coronavirus QuarantineEven though he’s received many internship and job offers from his coronavirus tracking website, Schiffman’s focus remains on the main objective of his project, which is to help, and not add to the growing panic as the virus spreads. He said:“I have to admit that it is pretty scary, especially here in Seattle which is the epicenter from which the virus spread in this area. There have been a lot of school closures and cancellations of events. It’s a ghost town around here.”Schiffmann said he was worried about the spread of misinformation, and blamed the media for causing unnecessary panic, adding:“People should have preparedness plans and stock up in advance instead of going on panicked Costco runs now.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
FOX: O.C. District Attorney Warns Residents After Release of 7 ‘High-Risk’ Sex Offenders During Coronavirus Pandemic,"Prosecutors in Orange County, California issued a warning to the public on Tuesday, April 28, about the release of seven sex offenders in 21 days — some “who spent just days behind bars despite being accused of cutting off their GPS monitors.”In a news release, the district attorney’s office said the seven registered sex offenders, with crimes including indecent exposure, sexual battery and child molestation, were released beginning on April 7. Their release is the result of rulings by appointed Court Commissioner Joseph Dane, Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said.MDs Dealing with Covid-19 Give Press Conference of What They Feel Needs to ChangeSpitzer called the men “the most dangerous kind of criminal and the most likely to reoffend.” He added:“These are not the kind of people who should be getting a break.”CBS: Publix is Buying Excess Milk and Produce From Farmers — and Donating it to Food BanksOrange County Sheriff Don Barnes announced Tuesday that the jail population in the county has been reduced by nearly 45 percent since March 7 due to the coronavirus. After additional steps were taken to make sure inmates were safe during the crisis, Barnes said overcrowding is not an issue.Spitzer called the decision to release the inmates “dangerous” and vowed that his office will not appear in front of Dane on parole violations involving registered sex offenders. He went on to say:“It is not the court’s responsibility to control the jail population by releasing these dangerous criminals back into our communities. The residents of Orange County deserve to have the peace of mind that registered sex offenders are being held accountable and not just let out the front door of a jail by a court commissioner who refuses to follow the law.”Spitzer and Barnes have both also expressed frustration over a statewide order that bail be reduced to zero for many offenders.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"Hole in the Wall Will Help You Have Safe Sex During Pandemic, Canada Officials Say","Public health officials in one Canadian province issued a new set of guidelines for having safe sex during the coronavirus pandemic. The results were nothing short of frank.The B.C. Centre for Disease Control pointed to masturbation, virtual sex, and positions that limit face-to-face contact as the safest options in a fact sheet published Wednesday, saying it’s better to acknowledge the reality than “shame people.” The agency highlighted masturbation as the safest option, stating in the guidelines:“You are your safest sex partner.”Nicole Pasquino, the clinical practice director at Options for Sexual Health, told the Canadian broadcast service CBC News:“I think the worst thing we can ever do is shame people. Sex is an important part of all people’s lives and it’s not something that’s just going to stop when there’s a pandemic, nor should it for some people that are able to continue in a low-risk way.”British Columbia’s public health agency’s updated guidelines said individuals who are not sick or otherwise showing symptoms should make informed decisions about having sex.Harvard Says Couples Should Wear Masks While Having SexOfficials also said “video dates, phone chats, sexting, online chat rooms and group cam rooms” are a safe alternative to physical contact. The agency listed several health and safety precautions for those engaging in intimate physical relations with another person — including washing before and after sex, wearing a mask, avoiding kissing and using sexual positions that limit contact.

Harvard Says Couples Should Wear Masks While Having Sex,"Couples in the UK who are not quarantining together should consider wearing face masks that cover their noses and mouths while having sex.The advice is from Harvard University Researchers and was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine last month. The researchers have offered a guide on sexual health in the era of COVID-19.They recommend that couples who are not quarantining together but continue to be sexually active consider not kissing on the mouth and wearing protective face masks during sex to prevent coronavirus spread. The study says:“Sexual contact carries some risk for exposure to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.For some patients, complete abstinence from in-person sexual activity is not an achievable goal.In these situations, having sex with persons with whom they are self-quarantining is the safest approach.Those unable to take this approach may benefit from risk reduction counseling, which has proven effective in other realms of sexual health.Patients should also be provided with information about how to reduce the risk for other sexually transmitted infections as well as the importance of continued use of contraceptives during this time to prevent unwanted pregnancy.”New York Post: Nurse in Texas Develops Masks with Better Filtration than N95The researchers also provide clinicians with ‘guidance on how to address sexual health and activity with patients in this context.’The guide explains that there is some risk for people who have intercourse with partners with whom they are quarantining. There is also an increased risk of contracting the virus from another household member by merely living together.NBC: Harvard’s Chemistry Chair Charged with Lying About China ContractThe researchers say clinicians should counsel them on risk-reduction techniques for those having sex with people who live outside their homes. These include ‘minimizing the number of sexual partners, avoiding sex partners with symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2. They also suggest avoiding kissing as well as sexual activities that involve semen.The researchers also recommend that people shower before and after sex and clean the area with soap or alcohol wipes.The study comes after an expert claimed that recovered coronavirus patients should avoid sex for 30 days.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

"WaPo: Nearly 25,000 Email Addresses and Passwords Allegedly From NIH, WHO, Gates Foundation and Others are Dumped Online","Anonymous activists have posted nearly 25,000 email addresses and passwords allegedly belonging to the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the Gates Foundation, and other groups, according to the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors online extremism and terrorist groups.SITE, based in Bethesda, Md., was unable to verify whether the email addresses and passwords were authentic, but the group said the information was released Sunday and Monday and almost immediately used to promote attempts at hacking. Robert Potter, an Australian cybersecurity expert, said he was able to verify that the WHO email addresses and passwords were real.The lists, whose origins are unclear, appear to have first been posted to message board 4chan, and later to Pastebin, a text storage site, to Twitter and to Telegram, a messaging app. Rita Katz, SITE’s executive director, said:“Neo-Nazis and white supremacists capitalized on the lists and published them aggressively across their venues. Using the data, far-right extremists were calling for a harassment campaign while sharing conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. The distribution of these alleged email credentials were just another part of a months-long initiative across the far right to weaponize the covid-19 pandemic.”The report by SITE said the largest group of alleged emails and passwords was from the NIH, with 9,938 found on lists posted online. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had the second-highest number, with 6,857. The World Bank had 5,120. The list of WHO addresses and passwords totaled 2,732.Bill Gates – Most Dangerous Philanthropist in Modern History?Smaller numbers of entries were listed for the Gates Foundation, a private philanthropic group whose co-founder, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, last week announced $150 million in new funding to combat the pandemic. Also targeted was the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a Chinese research center in the city where the pandemic began that has been accused of a role in triggering the outbreak.Bill Gates’ Philanthropy: 30,000 Indian girls used as guinea pigs to test cancer vaccineThe NIH, CDC, WHO and World Bank did not immediately reply to requests for comment Tuesday evening. The Gates Foundation said in a statement:“We are monitoring the situation in line with our data security practices. We don’t currently have an indication of a data breach at the foundation.”The FBI declined to comment.Twitter spokeswoman Katie Rosborough said:“We’re aware of this account activity and are taking widespread enforcement action under our rules, specifically our policy on private information. We’re also taking bulk removal action on the URL that links to the site in question.”Potter, chief executive of Australian company Internet 2.0, said he was able to gain access into the WHO computer systems using email addresses and passwords posted on the Internet. The WHO has come under heavy criticism, including from President Trump, who suspended funding to it, for its response to the novel coronavirus and has been accused of being too deferential to China.30 Million Dead: Bill Gates Sees a Genetically Engineered Bioweapon Triggering the Next Global PandemicPotter said many at the WHO had used their first name or “changeme” as their password, adding:“Their password security is appalling. Forty-eight people have ‘password’ as their password.”Potter said the alleged email addresses and passwords might have been purchased from vendors on the dark Web, a portion of the Internet that is not indexed by most search engines and where hacked information is frequently posted for sale. He said the WHO credentials appear to have come from a hack in 2016.Katz said that while material from old SITE hacks does appear on the dark Web infrequently, “we have not yet found any rock-solid proof of that for this specific case.”References to the hacked information are already being deployed online, including linking HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to the coronavirus.A Twitter post with links to the data said, “Anons know what to do…make this go viral.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

Social media posts indicate the woman was initially arrested during a peaceful protest at Kleiner Park. Brady said:“I feel like I was singled out because I was the only person that was arrested. I wasn’t the only person standing on the bark. I definitely wasn’t playing on the playground equipment. I wasn’t swinging, never touched them. But yeah, I do feel like I was singled out and maybe it was because I asked too many questions.”Officers said they informed several people gathered on the closed playground equipment that they could move to the other areas of the park.The playground was wrapped with caution tape and signage announcing the playground was closed due to COVID-19.NY Post: North Korean Official Reportedly Executed for Breaking Coronavirus QuarantineCBS: As Part of Quarantine Enforcement, California Officials Fill Skatepark with 74,000 Pounds of SandMeridian officers say they made several attempts to help Brady adhere to the rules and that she was not complying with the requests.

"Business Insider: Lady Gaga Raised $35 Million in 7 Days for the WHO’s Global Coronavirus Response Fund, and Spearheaded a Virtual Festival","The World Health Organization’s Solidarity Response Fund has increased by $35 million, due to the efforts of Lady Gaga, according to a Business Insider report.On April 6, Gaga said at a WHO media briefing that she helped raise the amount in seven days by calling on corporate leaders and philanthropists. The Business Insider reported that Lady Gaga said the funds will go toward global PPE supplies, testing kits, and help “improve lab capacity” to process the tests.USA Today: Trump Announces ‘Halt’ in US Funding to World Health Organization Amid Coronavirus PandemicThe World Health Organization’s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said when announcing Lady Gaga at the briefing:“We have said consistently that we are all in this together and we can only succeed together. We need an all-of-society approach with everyone playing their part. That includes people in the entertainment industry.”Recently, Gaga partnered with the WHO and the music festival organization Global Citizen to spearhead a streamed musical festival called “One World Together at Home” that celebrated “the power of the human” that the pandemic has brought to light, said Business Insider.Rolling Stone: Madonna Partners With Bill Gates, Donates $1 Million to COVID-19 EffortsAccording to Business Insider’s report, the concert, which featured dozens of stars, wasn’t a fundraiser, but rather it was intended to bring attention to all the positive occurring in the world now, too.Gaga praised frontline healthcare workers, throughout her announcement. Business Insider quoted her saying:“My heart is very, very, achy and warm for those who are ER doctors and nurses who are sleeping in cars to make sure they don’t infect their families or their patients,” Gaga said. “What you’re doing is putting yourselves in harm’s way to help the world, and we all salute you and you are a triumph, truly.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

"“The Brave New World of Bill Gates and Big Telecom” by Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and Dafna Tachover","Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. wrote last week about Malibu police’s ticketing Point Dume surfers $1,000 apiece for using the ocean during the quarantine. Was this merely an appalling police judgment at which we will laugh post-quarantine? Or does anyone else feel that this is the first wave of compliance and obedience training for something more permanent? Are powerful state and corporate entities using the current crisis to remove basic rights, and intensify pressures to promote vaccines and surveillance? Does anyone else feel the suffocating darkness of tyranny descending on our nation? And finally, does anyone share my dread that Bill Gates—and his long-time associate Tony Fauci—will somehow be running our Brave New World? Imagine a world where the government doesn’t need police officers to apprehend those surfers or ticket you when you violate social distancing with your girlfriend. Suppose that computers discover your beach trip by tracking your movements using a stream of information from your cell phone, your car, your GPS, facial recognition technology integrated with real-time surveillance from satellites, mounted cameras, and implanted chips. Desk-bound prosecutors or robots will notify you of your violation by text while simultaneously withdrawing your $1,000 penalty in cryptocurrency from your payroll account. Welcome to Bill Gates’ America. It’s right around the corner.Recently, Bill Gates announced his financial support for a $1 billion plan to blanket Earth in video surveillance satellites.  The company, EarthNow, will launch 500 satellites to live-stream monitor almost every “corner” of the Earth, providing instantaneous video feedback with only a one-second delay. According to Wikipedia, the company expects its customers to include “governments and large enterprises.” 5G Antennas­­­ deploying a vast array of ground-based 5G spy antennas. Through his Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates purchased 5.3 million Crown Castle shares currently worth a billion dollars. The Foundation’s second-largest tech holding after Microsoft, Crown Castle owns 5G infrastructure in every major U.S. market. It operates and leases more than 40,000 cell towers, 65,000 small cell nodes which are the central infrastructure for 5G and 75,000 route miles of fiber to every major U.S. market that, instead of going to your home, providing you safe, fast, wired internet, has been confiscated to connect 5G cell towers.Big Telecom, Big Data, and Bill Gates are baiting Americans into a digital tyranny-trap with million-dollar TV ads that pretend that their multi trillion-dollar  5G investment is about faster download speeds for video games and movies. But 5G has almost nothing to do with improving your lives; it’s all about controlling your life, marketing products, and harvesting your data for Artificial Intelligence purposes. The 21st century’s “black gold” is data. 5G is the infrastructure for Gates’ “Internet of Things”—a world where tens of billions of “smart” devices: cell phones, computers, automobiles, garage door openers, Apple watches, baby diapers and even our living bodies—are wirelessly interconnected to enable Big Data to gather and sell our personal information.Gates, Elon Musk, Amazon, Facebook, and Telecom are launching the flagships for the new Gold Rush, a teeming fleet of 50,000 satellites and a network of 2,000,000 ground antennas and cell towers to strip mine data from our smart devices. This microwave radiation-emitting spider web will allow Big Data/Big Telecom and Big Brother to capture what happens inside and outside every person at every moment of life. Gates will harvest, control, sort, characterize, analyze, and sell millions of terabytes of personal information from smart devices—private health data, medical records, our shopping habits, our biometric and behavioral responses to advertising, our children’s ability to learn, our facial expressions, and conversations overheard by Siri, Alexa, and your open cell phone’s microphones. His and other corporations will use these analytics to develop Artificial Intelligence (AI) and turn you into a predictable, easily-manipulated consuming machine.Next time you buy a “smart” device, remember the device is not the product—you are.Corporations will use Gates’ 5G surveillance system to sell products and escalate AI capacity. Governments will use it to transition the globe to a totalitarian singularity more despotic than Orwell ever imagined. Silicon Valley titans like Elon Musk, Peter Thiel, and Google’s Chief Engineer Ray Kurzweil talk longingly of “transhumanism,” the process by which humanity will transition to become part-human, part-machine via genetic engineering and surgical implants.Bill Gates is investing heavily to accelerate this altered reality. His ambition to tag us all with injected subdermal vaccine data chips seems to be merely a steppingstone toward an all-encompassing surveillance state.Microsoft has patented a sinister technology that utilizes implanted sensors to monitor body and brain activity. It will reward compliant humans with crypto currency payments when they perform assigned activities.The Patent, WO |2020| 060606 has gained notoriety and the nickname “World Order 2020 666.” Microsoft describes this device as a “Crypto Currency System” and explains that it is “capable of” using body activity data to mine bitcoin in response to compliance with assigned tasks.People who agree to install the Microsoft harmful wireless sensors will receive periodic “duty” smart phone instructions to watch a certain advertisement, listen to a specific song, walk down a specific grocery store aisle, or to take a certain vaccine. This chip will collect data from embedded sensors that monitor brain waves, blood flow, and other body reactions. The system will transfer cryptocurrency into the subject’s account after completion of the assigned task. On the bright side, Microsoft’s dystopian invention should be a welcome source of income for the 40% of Americans put out of work by periodic COVID quarantines, by Musk’s self-driving electronic cars, which also rely on the 5G rollout, and by Artificial Intelligence, including robots. Will Gates sell the data we freely give him to companies that will take away our jobs?Maintaining and analyzing the data collected by a 5G infrastructure require massive computers housed in major data storage complexes. To keep control of this infrastructure, Bill Gates is building his own “smart city” in Arizona. According to KPNX-TV, he spent $80 million on a 24,800-acre plot near Phoenix with the goal of turning it into a “smart city” where everything is interconnected via a wireless grid, including fleets of autonomous vehicles. The 80,000 residents of Gates’ company town will mainly work in data centers.To consolidate his control over what people hear, learn, and think, Gates bought shares in Liberty Global, one of the largest international television and Internet companies, operating in 30 countries and growing.Gates will even control your body, your bedroom, your medicine cabinet and even women’s menstrual and ovulation cycles. He invested approximately $18 million in MicroCHIPS, a company that among other chip-based devices, develops birth-control implant chips with wireless on/off switches and chips for drug-delivery that allow a single implant to store and precisely deliver hundreds of therapeutic doses over months or years. The implants will be operated wirelessly by the patient to deliver medication. Knowing of Gates’ missionary zeal for population control, however, some customers might worry that the system could be remotely activated as well.Gates’ apparent conviction that God has ordained him to use technology for humanity’s salvation is exemplified in one of his most ambitious projects. Gates is funding Harvard scientists to use Geoengineering to block the sun to reverse global warming and climate change.That project is a template for both hubris, hypocrisy and risk. The massive expansion of wireless use and the 5G wireless grid—for which Gates is a major player—is the most significant contributor to increased energy consumption. The expansion of the wireless cloud between 2012–2015 was equivalent to adding 4.9 million cars to the roads. 5G is expected to exponentially increase energy use by upwards of 170% by 2026. Proposing to use the wireless “smart” grid to combat the carbon footprint with geotechnology is a hare-brained scheme—not a solution for climate change.To consolidate global control, Gates has declared war on cash, and the COVID-19 lockdowns have provided governments a convenient pretext for scuttling cash as a health hazard. Gates and his foundation are spearheading the global shift from a cash economy towards digital transactions. Gates and Microsoft are perfectly positioned to profit from a digital payments system. By controlling digital transactions (and removing cash), Gates can control and monitor everything commercial that a country and its citizens do.Western financial institutions—Mastercard, PayPal, Visa, eBay, and Citi—have long pushed for a cashless world. Electronic banking allows banks and financial consortiums to levy fees on every transaction.The Digital Economy will allow the Government to monitor and scrutinize every transaction, to freeze digital accounts, and to block “financial flows” to punish disobedience. Operating in a public-private partnership with government, tech billionaires will not only control the nation but will be able to micromanage the worldwide population. Digitized currency is the ultimate instrument of social control. After all, in a cashless society, survival is impossible without access to the digitized economic system. The poor—lacking bank accounts—will suffer disproportionately.While the lockdown is a cataclysm for the world economy, it is an opportunity for Gates. By purchasing our devalued assets at a penny on the dollar, Gates’ $100 billion might make him the world’s first trillionaire. But the quarantine is also an opportunity to enlarge his power and dominion. Under Gates’ leadership, Microsoft became known as “The Borg” because of his appetite for total market control. Now, Gates seeks to bring all humanity under his boot. His worship of technology and his megalomania threaten our freedoms, our democracy, our biology, our planet, our humanity, and our souls.The microwave radiation used for wireless surveillance of the world is not biologically tolerable, especially for developing children. Thousands of peer-reviewed, published studies abundantly document wireless technology’s profound, adverse, physical effects on humans, animals and plants. Sickness and environmental degradation from wireless technology is already widespread. Big Telecom control of U.S. and global regulatory agencies and media and Gates’ financial control of the World Health Organization have allowed a few billionaires to propagate the patent lie that wireless is safe.Gates’ technological dreams are not biologically sustainable. His Tower of Babel is bound to collapse, with catastrophic impact for lesser humans. It’s time to dismantle the Tower before it’s too late.*Article was originally published at Children’s Health Defense.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

CNN: An ER Doctor Loses Custody of Daughter Because of Coronavirus Fears,"A doctor in Miami, Florida, has temporarily lost custody of her 4-year-old daughter while she treats patients during the coronavirus pandemic.Dr. Theresa Greene, an ER doc, and her ex-husband have been divorced for almost two years and have equally split time with their daughter.Circuit Court Judge Bernard Shapiro ruled last week that the child should stay with her father, Eric Greene, to limit the risk of exposure to coronavirus. The judge wrote in the court ruling:“The Court does not enter this Order lightly but given the pandemic in Florida and the recent increase in confirmed COVID-19 cases, the Court finds in order to insulate and protect the best interests and health of the minor child, this Order must be entered on a temporary basis.”FORBES: New York Is Making Its Own Hand Sanitizer Using Inmate Labor to Fight The Coronavirus OutbreakGreen said that she was appealing the emergency order that granted her ex-husband full custody of their daughter, telling CNN’s New Day:“I think it’s not fair, it’s cruel to ask me to choose between my child and the oath I took as a physician. I won’t abandon my team at work or the patients who will increasingly look to me to save their lives in the coming weeks, but it’s torture.”Theresa Greene said that she felt the order discriminated against her as a divorced parent, adding:“If I was married I’d be given the opportunity to go home to my child, no one could tell me I shouldn’t do that.”Greene, whose daughter usually stays with her ex-husband when she works, indicated that she’s been able to wear full PPE while treating patients and that she’s done everything she can to avoid contracting the disease. She said:“Yes it is severe and there is danger, and we’re being very careful. We use every thing we can. I’ve actually worn equipment above and beyond to protect myself and my child.”INDEPENDENT: Coronavirus: Space Images Reveal Drastic Fall in Pollution Over China as Factories ClosedPaul Leinoff, Eric Greene’s attorney, said in a statement:“Mr. Greene and I have the upmost respect for Dr. Greene’s commitment to her critical work during this pandemic.We recognize and genuinely appreciate the sacrifices that she and all healthcare workers are all currently making to save lives and prevent further illness in Florida and around the world. The Greenes’ temporary timesharing dispute was presented before the Court based upon the specific facts of this individual family and a decision was reached based upon the best interests and safety of a minor child, limited to the temporary circumstances presented by COVID-19. The Court’s ruling was not intended to serve as a blanket rule, nor should it. Pursuant to Mr. Greene’s request and as ordered by the Court, Dr. Greene is to be provided future make-up timesharing for each day missed during this challenging time and daily video communication with the child. We will continue to pursue ways to resolve this delicate situation and believe that a result can be achieved safely and fairly.”Theresa Greene doesn’t know when she will get to see her daughter again because there is no way to know when the pandemic will be over. She said that her daughter doesn’t understand what’s going on, but she knows that her mom is sad, adding:“I want her when she grows up to be proud of me by abiding to the oath that I took when I went into medicine, but I also know that she needs me now.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
The NIH Claims Joint Ownership of Moderna’s Coronavirus Vaccine,"The National Institutes of Health may own intellectual property that undergirds a coronavirus vaccine being developed by Moderna, according to documents obtained by Axios and analysis from Public Citizen.By having an actual stake in the vaccine, the federal government could try to make the vaccine a free or low-cost public good with wide distribution, if the product turns out to be safe and effective.The NIH largely funds outside research, but it also often invents basic scientific technologies that are later licensed out and incorporated into drugs that are sold at massive profits. The agency rarely claims ownership stakes or pursues patent rights, but that appears to be different with this coronavirus vaccine. In May, NIH Director Francis Collins said of Moderna’s coronavirus vaccine during an Economic Club interview:“We do have some particular stake in the intellectual property.” New evidence shines a light on the extent of NIH’s involvement. NIH and Moderna have researched coronaviruses, like MERS, for several years, and signed a contract this past December that stated “mRNA coronavirus vaccine candidates [are] developed and jointly owned” by the two parties. The contract was not specific to the novel coronavirus, and it was signed before the new virus had been sequenced.Gates and Company’s COVID-19 Vaccine Boosterism Ignores Significant SARS Coronavirus Vaccine Risks Known for Over a DecadeNew York Times: CDC Labs Were Contaminated, Delaying US Coronavirus Testing, Officials SaySeparately,four NIH scientists have filed for a provisional patent application entitled “2019-nCoV vaccine,” according to disclosures in a pending scientific paper. Moderna scientists co-authored that paper, but none are listed as vaccine co-inventors.That makes it clear “the government and the public have a stake” in the coronavirus vaccine, said Zain Rizvi, a health law and policy researcher at Public Citizen, adding:“The vaccine would not exist without the intellectual contributions of federal scientists.”NIH said in a statement that its scientists created the “stabilized coronavirus spike proteins for the development of vaccines against coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2,” and the government consequently has “sought patents to preserve the government’s rights to these inventions.”Flu Misinformation and Coronavirus Fears: My Letter to Dr. Sanjay GuptaFurther, NIH “has adopted a non-exclusive licensing approach for these patent rights in order to allow multiple vaccine developers” to make a vaccine.NIH added that “federal employees listed as inventors on these patent applications assigned their rights to the U.S. government. Accordingly, should the [United States Patent and Trademark Office] and other national patent authorities grant the patents, the U.S. government will hold ownership interest in the patents.”Moderna declined to comment beyond a statement, which said the company “has a broad owned and licensed IP estate” and is “not aware of any IP that would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, including” the coronavirus vaccine.The Times: Coronavirus May Vanish Too Fast for Vaccine TrialAccording to Rizvi, co-owning the vaccine could allow NIH to more broadly license the underlying technology to other vaccine manufacturers “without the consent of Moderna,” a company that is valued at $25 billion despite having no federally approved drugs on the market.Many experts anticipate a coronavirus vaccine, once proven safe and effective, would be made as widely available as possible, and that developers aren’t likely to seek big profits from it. Partial federal ownership could be a backstop if those assumptions don’t bear out, but NIH isn’t keen on stepping on industry’s toes. Collins said during his Economic Club interview:“Talking to the companies, I don’t hear any of them say they think this [vaccine] is a money-maker,” “I think they want to recoup their costs and maybe make a tiny percentage of increase of profit over that, like single digits percentage-wise, but that’s it. Nobody sees this as a way to make billions of dollars.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Washington Examiner: Fauci Warns Certain Coronavirus Vaccinations Could ‘Enhance the Negative Effect of the Infection’,"Appearing before a U.S. Senate panel, a top U.S. health official warned that some coronavirus vaccinations might harm more than help patients desperate for therapy.As the world awaits a reliable treatment for the coronavirus, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci told members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee that rushing a coronavirus vaccination could lead to “negative consequences,” including the disease being enhanced in a person instead of defeated. He said:“We will be investigating considerable resources in developing doses even before we know any given candidate or candidate’s work. I must warn that there is also the possibility of negative consequences where certain vaccines can actually enhance the negative effect of the infection.”“There are some important issues, however, in COVID-19 vaccine development. We have many candidates and hope to have multiple winners. In other words, it’s multiple shots on goal. This will be important because this will be good for global availability if we have more than one successful candidate.”NY POST: New York Mom with Coronavirus Saved by Medical-Student Son’s Quick ThinkingNewsweek: Dr. Fauci Backed Controversial Wuhan Lab with Millions of U.S. Dollars for Risky Coronavirus ResearchFauci also said the antiviral medicine remdesivir has shown “moderate success” at treating the coronavirus, but stressed that there is a “broad spectrum” of antiviral medicines that are being considered for therapy.Some have been critical of the pressure to find a vaccination that will prevent the coronavirus. Conservative talk show host Michael Savage, who holds a Ph.D. in nutritional ethnomedicine from the University of California, Berkeley, argued a vaccination would be “ineffective and dangerous.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

The city can decide to mandate a vaccine. It’s been done many times before in history, including just a couple of years ago in Brooklyn, especially affecting the Hasidic Jew population. If they did not get the MMR vaccine for their children they went to prison, faced fines, and could be separated from them. So they complied and gave their children the MMR vaccine to keep that from happening. That’s what we predict in the unforeseeable future.Hutchinson said he said he plans to bring up the topic at Naple’s next city council meeting.EDITOR’S NOTE: This story may have been down on NBC2’s site for a while today.

Broward County Order Says Masks Must Be Worn Inside Homes,"Broward County, Florida released a new emergency order which limits gatherings to no more than 10 people, mandates face masks, and establishes a nightly curfew. But one section of the emergency order has turned heads and is facing lawsuits: could Broward County really be ordering residents to wear masks inside their own homes?!Chris Nelson, the Fort Lauderdale resident who staged a protest against beach closures on July 4th and who was taken into custody last week at a Broward County news conference, intends to file a lawsuit against the county’s recent order.CBS: Michigan Governor’s Executive Order: Wear a Mask or Face $500 FineNelson, who is behind the group ReOpen South Florida, said his complaint refers to Section 4A of the order, which says that residents of single or multi-family homes must enforce mask mandates on their property, including when they have guests over. Nelson said:“What this is saying is the property owner is responsible for telling everybody, any person on that property, including family plus guests, that they have to wear a mask. So basically, if I want to have anybody come over to my house, I have to ensure they wear a mask and if I don’t and my neighbor suspects I’m not and calls the cops, I’m subject to a legal fine for not making people in my own house wear a mask. This steps way over the line.“The clause itself states:Section 4. Responsibility to Ensure Compliance with Applicable Orders. A. Residential Property Residents. All persons who reside on any residential property, whether single family or multi-family, and irrespective of whether they own or rent the property, must ensure that all persons on the residential property, including guests, comply with all applicable guidelines of any Broward County Emergency Order, including the facial covering requirements. Residents who fail to ensure compliance with all applicable Broward County Emergency Orders by such persons shall be subject to the penalties set forth in Section 8-56 of the Broward County Code of Ordinances, with each person present and in violation of an applicable Emergency Order constituting a separate violation.A county spokesperson referred a Sun Sentinel reporter to an FAQ page that explains that residents are in fact responsible for making sure everyone on the property complies with the guidelines in the emergency order, including the facial covering requirements. According to the FAQ page: Residents who don’t do so are “individually liable and subject to civil and criminal penalties” and “each person present in violation of Broward County Emergency Orders constitutes a separate violation subject to a $1,000 fine.” Harvard Says Couples Should Wear Masks While Having SexRep. Anthony Sabatini, R-Howey-in-the Hills, said he plans to file the lawsuit against the county’s order this week and will represent Nelson’s cause, saying:“I just think it’s a blatant violation of due process. People have a substantive right of association and reasonable expectation of privacy. This is a radical step in the wrong direction.”It is at least the third lawsuit in South Florida over mask requirements. Groups of residents in both Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties have sued the counties over the orders.Some lawyers say the lawsuits have no standing and the government has the right to pass laws in the interest of public health and safety. Malik Leigh, an attorney and former law teacher said:“Any state government, through the 10th Amendment, can make a law for which its constitutionality is questioned if there is a ‘rational relation to a legitimate state interest. In this case, the state has an interest in public safety during a pandemic. Bill of Rights freedoms are often denied so long as there exists a legitimate reason.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"LA Times: Face Masks Now Required Whenever L.A. Residents Leave Homes, Garcetti Says","Angelenos, except for small children and some people with disabilities, must now wear face masks when they leave the house, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday, May 13.Previously, Garcetti had only required people to wear masks at grocery stores, sitting in taxis and rideshare vehicles, on buses, and at the airport. Regarding the change, the mayor added:“And as long as you’re not doing a solitary activity or with your own household, put that mask on. Always now.”1He said establishing this requirement “will help us get more freedoms, open up more parts of our city.”Many experts have said masks can provide some protection against the spread of the virus. Up to now, the city has required face coverings only while conducting essential business, such as grocery shopping. The city also require workers to wear masks.Mom, a Former Cop, Arrested on Miami Beach After She Walks Out Onto the Sand in Protest of Its ClosureThe increased face mask requirements come as stay-at-home orders are slowly easing up. All retail shops can now reopen, and many public recreational places are being opened, including trails, tennis courts, equestrian facilities, model airplane fields, and golf courses.Garcetti also announced that a “slow streets” initiative, which includes closing roads to cars in some neighborhoods, will get underway this weekend. The program aims to create more outdoor space for pedestrians, allowing people to keep their distance from each other better.

USA Today: Trump Announces ‘Halt’ in US Funding to World Health Organization Amid Coronavirus Pandemic,"President Donald Trump said Tuesday his administration will “halt” U.S. funding to the World Health Organization as it conducts a review of the global organization’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. “The reality is that the WHO failed to adequately obtain, vet and share information in a timely and transparent fashion,” the president said in a Rose Garden press conference.Trump has accused the organization of not moving quickly enough to sound the alarm over COVID-19 and of being too China friendly. He has attacked the agency for advising the U.S. against banning travel from China to other parts of the world amid the outbreak.“And the World – WHO – World Health got it wrong,” the president told reporters at the White House last week. “I mean, they got it very wrong. In many ways, they were wrong. They also minimized the threat very strongly and – not good.”The U.S. paid $893 million to the WHO during its two-year budget window, according to the organization’s website.

Flu Misinformation and Coronavirus Fears: My Letter to Dr. Sanjay Gupta,"Dear Sanjay,Last week, your CNN producer, Matthew Reynard, notified me that CNN is featuring me in a documentary about “vaccine misinformation”. As usual, Mr. Reynard did not point out a single factual assertion by me that was incorrect (I carefully source all of my statements about vaccines to government databases or peer-reviewed publications). CNN uses the term “vaccine misinformation” as a euphemism for any statement that departs from the Government / Pharma orthodoxy that all vaccines are safe, necessary, and effective for all people.I have always admired you, Sanjay. Your obvious talents aside, you seem to be genuinely compassionate and to value integrity. Earlier in your career, you showed a courageous willingness to challenge Big Pharma’s vaccine orthodoxies. However, I respectfully point out that CNN and particularly you, Sanjay, are today among the most prolific broadcasters of “vaccine misinformation”. Over the last several years, I cannot recall seeing a single substantial CNN segment on vaccines that did not include easily verified factual misstatements. CNN’s recent special, “Pandemic”, was a showcase of erroneous assertions about the flu vaccine. Since I don’t like to think that you deliberately mislead the public—particularly about critical public health choices—I have taken the time to point out some of your most frequent errors.I hope you will take time to read this. This critique has special relevance during the current coronavirus crisis, not to mention its important implications for the roles of government and press in a democracy. CNN and other media outlets treat CDC, NIH, and WHO pronouncements as infallible truths. In fact, regulatory capture has made these agencies subsidiaries of Big Pharma, and the lies that CDC has been telling us about flu are now muddying the debate over coronavirus.1. CNN assertion: In your annual flu shot promotions, you routinely parrot CDC’s estimates of overall flu deaths which have ranged in recent years from 36,000 for the 1990-1991 flu season to 80,000 for the 2017-2018 flu season.Fact: The HHS’s mortality and morbidity data—available on the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) website—show that CDC’s (and CNN’s) annual estimates are off by orders of magnitude.NCHS data report the average number of mortalities attributable to influenza on death certificates is little more than 1,000. CDC devises its inflated estimate by deliberately conflating flu deaths with pneumonia deaths. This device is deceitful since most of these fatalities are unrelated to the flu (and therefore, impervious to flu vaccines). In 2005, the British Medical Journal (BMJ) Editor, Dr. Peter Doshi, published a comprehensive rebuke of CDC’s annual ritual of exaggerating flu mortalities entitled “Dissecting CDC’s Deception: Are US Flu Death Figures More PR Than Science?” Doshi accuses the CDC of purposefully inflating flu deaths to frighten the public into purchasing vaccines. To illustrate CDC’s chicanery, Doshi observed that CDC’s announced number of reported pneumonia and influenza deaths in 2001 at 62,034. Yet less than half of one percent of those were actually attributed to influenza. Furthermore, of the mere 257 cases that could reasonably be blamed on the flu in CDC’s mortality data, only 7 percent were laboratory confirmed cases of influenza. That’s 18 lab confirmed influenza cases out of 62,034 “pneumonia and influenza” deaths—or just 0.03 percent, according to HHS’s own National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).Subtracting pneumonia, the true number of influenza-associated deaths from 1979 to 2002 averaged 1,348, according to the NCHS data. CNN routinely reports figures forty times this number.Dr. Doshi charges the CDC with deliberately lying about annual flu deaths to “[work] in manufacturers’ interest by conducting campaigns to increase flu vaccination”. He warns that “by arbitrarily linking flu with pneumonia, current data are statistically biased.”By faithfully parroting CDC inflated numbers—with no due diligence—CNN has made itself complicit in this annual charade, making it difficult now to accurately assess the relative risk of COVID-19 as compared to flu and, therefore, rationally measure an appropriate response.2. CNN assertion: CNN routinely promotes the flu shot for everyone older than 6 months, proclaiming that the best way to protect against serious cases of the ailment “is to get a flu shot”.Fact: In reality, there is absolutely no scientific basis for the CDC’s assertion that the influenza vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the flu.The Cochrane Collaboration’s comprehensive 2010 meta-analysis of published influenza vaccine studies found that the influenza vaccination has “no effect” on hospitalization, and that there is “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications.”The Cochrane Researchers concluded in 2010 that the scientific evidence “seem[s] to discourage the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.” Four years later, Cochrane published a follow-up meta-review including dozens of more recent scientific studies and again concluded bluntly that the body of scientific data provides “no evidence for the utilization of vaccination against influenza in healthy adults as a routine public health measure.”In other words, despite CNN’s relentless hectoring, there is no scientific evidence that all the billions of dollars America spends on influenza vaccination each year actually provides any health benefit, much less a net economic benefit—apart from the financial windfall to the four pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these vaccines—and who happen to be among CNN’s top advertisers. 3. CNN assertion: You and CNN frequently parrot CDC’s claim that a flu shot reduces the chances that an individual will transmit the flu to others. Pandemic repeated this assertion. CNN offers this supposed benefit as the justification for school vaccine mandates.Fact: However, in their 2010 systematic meta review of the literature, the Cochrane researchers found “no evidence that vaccines prevent viral transmission or complications”.Even more worrisome, a study from January 18, 2018, in the Journal of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, PNAS, found that influenza vaccination actually increased transmission of the virus, with vaccinated individuals shedding more than six times as much aerosolized virus in their breath than unvaccinated individuals.Those scientists were not altogether surprised by this finding explaining that “certain types of prior immunity”—in this case, the kind of immunity conferred by the vaccine as opposed to naturally acquired immunity— “promote lung inflammation, airway closure, and aerosol generation.” They conclude that, “If confirmed, this observation, together with recent literature suggesting reduced protection with annual vaccination, would have implications for influenza vaccination recommendations and policies.”4. CNN assertion: CNN frequently repeats CDC’s advice that children should get the flu shot, which you assure CNN’s audience has been proven safe.Fact: A 2012 Cochrane review looking at studies of influenza vaccination in healthy children found no safety studies in children under age two, and declared that safety studies were “urgently required”.5. CNN assertion: CNN also promotes CDC’s recommendation that all pregnant women get a flu shot.Fact:  CDC recommends the flu shot for pregnant women despite the fact that FDA—the agency charged with assessing vaccine safety—has refused to license the flu shot during pregnancy due to grave safety concerns. (Sanjay; I encourage you to confront FDA and make inquiries about this inter-agency conflict.) Every influenza vaccine package insert contains warnings about the lack of safety studies in pregnant women and nursing mothers.A 2014 Cochrane review found that the number of randomized, placebo-controlled trials examining the safety and effectiveness of vaccinating pregnant women was zero. A 2019 article by Alberto Donzelli in Human Vaccination & Immunotheraputics, asks the question, “Influenza vaccination for all pregnant women?” and argues, “So far the less biased evidence does not favour it”. Donelli found that public health recommendations on flu shots during pregnancy had systematically overestimated “the vaccine effectiveness and safety”—and that the published science showed “an excess of local adverse effects and a tendency for serious adverse events with uncertain or very limited protection against influenza”. Donzelli observes that flu vaccine trials in Africa and Asia have shown excessive infection and deaths in infants associated with flu shots during pregnancy.6. CNN assertion: CNN urges seniors to get their flu shots. CDC credits the vaccine with a dramatic reduction in influenza-related deaths among the elderly.Fact: The scientific community has thoroughly debunked CDC’s claims that the flu shot reduces death among seniors.Researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ridicule CDC’s mortality claims in a study published in April 2005 in Archives of Internal Medicine    (now JAMA Internal Medicine). Those NIH researchers pointed out that, despite a dramatic increase in vaccination coverage among people aged 65 or older—from at most 20 percent before 1980 to 65 percent in 2001—pneumonia and influenza mortality rates “rose substantially during this period”.The lead author of the 2005 NIH study, Lone Simonsen, was also coauthor with W. Paul Glezen of a 2006 commentary in the International Journal of Epidemiology that reiterated the problems with the CDC’s claims. “Although the vaccination rate for elderly people had increased by as much as 67 percent from 1989 to 1997, there was no evidence that vaccination reduced hospitalizations or deaths. On the contrary, “mortality and hospitalization rates continued to increase rather than decline”.The 2005 NIH study authors commented that this result was “surprising” since vaccination was supposed to be “highly effective at reducing influenza-related mortality”—an assumption underlying CDC policy that “has never been studied in clinical trials”.Similarly, a 2008 review in Virology Journal, observes that contrary to the CDC’s claims of a great beneficial effect on mortality, “influenza mortality and hospitalization rates for older Americans significantly increased in the 80s and 90s, during the same time that influenza vaccination rates for elderly Americans dramatically increased.”In a 2013 BMJ commentary, Dr. Doshi asked, “what evidence is there that influenza vaccines reduce deaths of older people—the reason the policy was originally created? Virtually none…” This means that influenza vaccines are approved for use in older people despite any clinical trials demonstrating a reduction in serious outcomes.”“Perhaps most perplexing,” Doshi added, “is officials’ lack of interest in the absence of good quality evidence.”7. CNN assertion: You frequently inform the CNN audience that “the flu vaccine is safe, and significant side effects are very rare.”Fact: Actual injury rates are impossible to determine since flu shots are exempt from pre-and-post-marketing placebo studies required of other medicines, and because HHS’s post-marketing surveillance system, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System [VAERS], captures “fewer than 1% of vaccine injuries” according to a 2010 HHS-funded study. Nevertheless, some alarming metrics ought to give you pause when you offer these assurances to millions of viewers; Flu vaccines account for nearly ¼ of payouts for injuries by the Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund (VICA). The Vaccine Court has paid out nearly $1 billion for injuries and deaths caused by flu shots.GSK’s vaccine, Flulaval lists, on its manufacturing inserts, over 45 chronic diseases and adverse reactions that FDA believes may be linked to the vaccine. These include a long menu of immune system, allergic, musculoskeletal, psychiatric, respiratory, skin, vascular, and neurological disease including seizure, paralysis, and syncope.Australian data link the influenza vaccine during the 2009 – 2010 flu season to a 1-in-110 risk in children of having febrile convulsions. The pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine in Europe was associated with a 1-in-55,000 risk of developing narcolepsy. CDC acknowledges that the Pandemrix flu vaccine is associated with an “increased risk of narcolepsy”.A 2015 meta-analysis published in the journal Vaccine has acknowledged “a small but statistically significant association between influenza vaccines, particularly the pandemic ones, and Guillen-Barre Syndrome (GBS)”.A 2004 study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, JAMA, noted that GBS was “the most frequent neurological condition reported after influenza vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS)”.The 2010 Cochrane meta-analysis chided that the post-mortality studies found that a statistically significant association between the influenza vaccine and GBS “demonstrate the danger of commencing a large vaccination campaign without adequate harms assessment.”8. CNN assertion: On March 5, 2020, you and Anderson Cooper did a “Town Hall” segment, “Corona Facts and Fears”, in which you fervently urged listeners to get the flu shot as the best way to keep healthy during the coronavirus pandemic.  According to Anderson, “If you are concerned about coronavirus, you should get a flu shot”.Fact: However, the only study we have been able to find assessing flu shots and coronavirus is a January 2020 US Pentagon study that found that the flu shot INCREASES the risks from coronavirus by 36%. “Receiving influenza vaccination may increase the risk of other respiratory viruses, a phenomenon known as “virus interference…’vaccine derived’ virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus…”9. CNN assertion: Sanjay, I’ve watched your video assuring the public that getting the flu shot cannot increase one’s chances of getting the flu.Fact: While that assertion has some meager support from a very small number of studies, the overwhelming weight of published science suggests that getting an annual flu shot can actually increase your risk of both flu and flu-like illnesses.Only about 7 percent to 15 percent of what are called “influenza-like illnesses” are actually caused by influenza viruses. Many studies suggest the flu vaccine increases vulnerability to both flu infections and the remaining 85% -93% of non-flu respiratory infections.A 2011 study of healthy Australian children published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal found that seasonal flu shots increase the risk of flu by 73% and doubled the risk of non-flu respiratory infections.Similarly, another 2012 randomized controlled trial published in Clinical Infectious Diseases found that influenza-vaccinated children had no significantly lessened risk from influenza and also a higher risk of infection from non-influenza viruses.Furthermore, the flu vaccine depletes capacity to fight off future flu infections. In April 2010, a study (by Skowronek, et al) published in the journal PLoS Medicine reported the “unexpected” finding from four epidemiologic studies in Canada that receipt of the influenza vaccine for the 2008 – 2009 season, while apparently effective in reducing the risk of illness due to the seasonal flu, was associated with an increased risk of illness due to the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) “swine flu” virus during the spring and summer of 2009. The scientists suggested that this finding could be due to the difference in the way the vaccine affects the immune system compared with natural infection.Under this hypothesis, repeated vaccination “effectively blocks the more robust, complex, and cross-protective immunity afforded by prior infection.”When unvaccinated people are infected with the seasonal influenza virus, they often develop a robust cell-mediated immunity that not only protects against that strain of the virus but is also cross-protective against other strains.People who’ve annually received the influenza vaccine, on the other hand, “may have lost multiple opportunities for infection-induced cross-immunity.”This is because the vaccine is designed to stimulate a strong antibody response, or humoral immunity, but does not confer the same kind of robust cell-mediated immunity as natural infection.NIH researchers in their 2005 study also acknowledged the superior effectiveness of naturally acquired immunity at reducing mortality, pointing out that senior citizens who contracted the H3N2 influenza pandemic infection demonstrated a robust immunity in subsequent flu seasons when compared to vaccinated individuals. The sharp decline in influenza-related deaths among people aged 65 to 74 years in the years immediately after the 1968 flu pandemic was most likely due to the acquisition of natural immunity to these viruses (from natural infections).Another study published in 2011 in the Journal of Virology confirmed that annual influenza vaccination indeed hampers the development of a robust cell-mediated immunity. Annual vaccination for influenza, the authors concluded, “may render young children who have not previously been infected with an influenza virus more susceptible to infection with a pandemic influenza virus of a novel subtype.”A 2018 CDC study found there was an increase of acute respiratory infections caused by non-influenza respiratory pathogens following influenza vaccination compared to unvaccinated children during the same period. The authors recommended that potential mechanisms for this association warrant further investigation.While most studies have looked at only one or two flu seasons, a CDC-funded study published in September 2014 in Clinical Infectious Diseases considered the long-term effects of repeated annual vaccination by looking at five years of vaccination data.The CDC researchers found that the more that people had been vaccinated in prior years,  the less effective the vaccine are at preventing the most recent season’s dominant H3N2 virus.As they put it, “vaccine-induced protection was greatest for individuals not vaccinated during the prior 5 years.”Essentially, the immune system remembers the original infection and puts out a rapid defense against it, at the expense of developing a new but more appropriate response specifically to the currently infecting strain.The CDC scientists warned that their data “raises relevant questions about the potential interference of repeated annual influenza vaccination and possible residual protection from previous season vaccination”; the authors called for further studies.10. CNN assertion: One final observation about a different vaccine; In CNN’s regular promotion of measles vaccines, CNN and Sanjay frequently claim that natural measles mortalities are 1-2 in 1000. Those estimates seem calculated to frighten people into taking a measles shot and to drive MMR mandates.Fact: CDC’s 1963 mortality and morbidity data show that prior to the introduction of the measles vaccine, improvements in nutrition and hygeine had already driven US measles mortality in U.S. to 400 per year, a population ratio of 1/500,000 and a death-case ratio of 1 in 10,000—about the same risk of dying from a lightning strike. Most of those mortalities were among malnourished children, many of whom suffered from intellectual disabilities. The best evidence suggests that measles mortalities would have continued to drop with the introduction of food stamps, W.I.C, and other childhood nutritional programs passed during the War on Poverty after 1964 to relieve hunger in impoverished communities. In their 2010 meta-analysis, the Cochrane researchers accused the CDC of deliberately misrepresenting the science in order to support their universal influenza vaccination recommendation. Nevertheless, CNN continually broadcasts CDC pronouncements as gospel and, ironically, ridicules those of us who actually read the science as “purveyors of ‘vaccine misinformation’”. Multiple comprehensive federal investigations and whistleblower declarations have documented the corrupt relationship between the CDC’s Vaccine Branch and the four vaccine makers: Merck, Pfizer, Sanofi, and GSK. These include a 2000 report by the US Congress Government Oversight Committee , a 2009 report by the Federal HHS Inspector General, a 2014 letter by David Wright, Director of HHS Office of Research Integrity, and a 2011 letter to Carmen S. Villar, chief of staff for Tom Frieden, from an organization of CDC scientists calling itself “SPIDER”.In 2014, CDC’s senior vaccine safety scientist, Dr. William Thompson, a 17-year CDC veteran, who continues to work for CDC, confessed in a series of depositions, and public and private statements, that his CDC  bosses in CDC’s Immunization Branch had systematically ordered him and other researchers to destroy data and falsify study outcomes to hide CDC research linking vaccines to the exploding epidemic of childhood chronic diseases including autism. Doesn’t the abundant evidence of corruption at the Federal health agencies amplify CNN’s obligation to treat government pronouncements with skepticism?At a 2004 workshop for the Institute of Medicine, CDC unveiled a blueprint for the agency’s annual campaigns of fear and deception in a PowerPoint entitled  “‘Recipe’ for Fostering Public Interest and High Vaccine Demand”. CDC’s in-house P.R. flack Glen Nowak explained that it was necessary to use fear marketing to sell vaccines. CDC’s campaign called for encouraging television medical experts (like Sanjay and Elizabeth Cohen) to “state concern and alarm” about “and predict dire outcomes” from the flu season. To inspire the necessary terror, the CDC planned to encourage its tame journalists to describe each season as “very severe”, “more severe than last or past years”, and “deadly”. CDC’s press flacks stressed that it was especially important to inspire “concern, anxiety, and worry” among young, healthy adults who don’t regard the flu with sufficient dread.As the CDC bluntly stated it, “Health literacy is a growing problem”. In other words, the CDC considers it to be a problem that people are increasingly doing their own research and becoming more adept at educating themselves about health-related issues; Why? Because people who do their own research, read the science, and make informed choices rather than blindly following the CDC’s recommendations are less likely to get the flu shot.“Drug companies”, Dr. Doshi observes, “have long known that to sell some products, you would have to first sell people on the disease.” Only, in the case of the influenza vaccine, Doshi adds, “the salesmen are public health officials”. These public health officials have, in turn, transformed trusted journalists and television doctors into Pharma marketing reps.CNN likes to portray CDC’s annual flu shot campaigns as an important public health ritual. The peer-reviewed science exposes CDC’s campaigns as a mercantile propaganda project that is costly and may be injuring public health. CNN can fault CDC officials as the source of its “vaccine misinformation”. But this is a weak gesture. “People in power lie”, my father once told me. The function of journalism is to apply scrutiny and skepticism to the pronouncements of government officials and powerful corporations.Finally, Sanjay, you and Anderson Cooper often comment with dismay on the monumental tragedy, for our democracy, of having a president who habitually lies. But presidents come and go; the more enduring tragedy, arguably, is that we cannot trust our news media to tell us the truth about vital health issues when advertising dollars are at stake. You scratch your head and wonder how all those Trump supporters don’t share your indignation at President Trump’s mendacity. One answer is that they are disheartened by once-trusted media outlets who have also set the precedent of routinely lying and violating the public trust, wounding in the process our democracy, public faith in critical institutions, and the health of our children.Sincerely,Robert F. Kennedy Jr President, Children’s Health DefenseP.S. Just as a reminder, here is a 60 Minutes program from over 30 years ago.

Berlin Protests: Thousands of Demonstrators March on German Capital to Protest Coronavirus Restrictions,"Loudly chanting their opposition to coronavirus restrictions, thousands of people gathered in Berlin on Saturday to protest before being dispersed by police.The demonstration, called “The end of the pandemic – freedom day,” drew an estimated 20,000 people from various parts of Germany after weeks of planning. They said the Covid-19 measures implemented by the Government had violated rights and freedoms. Police used bullhorns to ask participants to adhere to safety precautions, including social distancing and wearing masks.The Times: Coronavirus May Vanish Too Fast for Vaccine TrialRobert F. Kennedy Jr. exposes Bill Gates & his relationship with Big PharmaThe protest was largely devoid of the standard safety measures that the government has enforced, with many refusing to wear masks or keep their distance. But most people have respected measures that include wearing face masks in shops, while the government has just imposed mandatory tests for holidaymakers returning from high-risk areas. Fox News reported the sentiment of the crowd:“We’re here and we’re loud, because we are being robbed of our freedom,” the crowd chanted. The protesters held up signs with phrases such as “We are being forced to wear a muzzle,” “Natural defense instead of vaccination” and “Corona, false alarm.”Overall, Germany’s approach to handling the pandemic has been seen as widely successful. The country has had a moderately lower death rate compared to other nations, with just over 9,000 deaths out of around 210,000 infections.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
WaPo: D.C. Council Approves Bill Allowing Children to Get Vaccines Without Parents’ Consent,"The D.C. Council has approved a bill giving children eleven years and older the option to receive vaccines without their parents’ approval.Under the legislation, if a doctor determines that a minor is capable of informed consent, they would be able to seek government-recommended vaccinations their parents object to on religious grounds. They could also get vaccinated against the human papillomavirus. HPV is suggested for older children but is opposed by some parents because the virus is sexually transmitted, and they oppose their teenagers having sex.CBS: New Bill Would Require NY Kids to Get HPV Vaccine to Go to School or DaycareThe “Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act” passed with a 12-1 vote, with 8th Ward Councilmember Trayon White the sole objector.The bill was introduced by Ward 3 Councilmember Mary Cheh and includes several measures to help ensure confidentiality. It directs health care providers to seek reimbursement directly from insurers, and it requires doctors to submit an immunization record directly to the young patient’s school instead of a parent.The bill was introduced in March 2019, before the phrase “COVID-19” entered the nation’s vocabulary and when a vaccine debate usually centered on something like a measles shot. Cheh said during a Zoom meeting this week:“A child needs to be protected against the dangers of things like measles, other diseases that cause death, and the community needs to be protected so that diseases that were once thought to be eliminated are not coming back.”Parents pull children out of school to protest proposed mandatory HPV, flu vaccine legislationWhite insisted that his reservations about the bill centered on bypassing parental decisions, and he contended that children are not capable of making major health decisions. He said:“Parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing, education and care of their children.”But Council Chairman Phil Mendelson said the public interest supersedes parenting concerns, citing the pandemic. He added:“That’s how important public health is. There’s a very compelling state interest there.”Candace Owen Goes Public About Her “Terrible” HPV Vaccine ReactionA representative of the D.C. chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which strongly supported the bill, said vaccination rates at D.C. public schools range from 87 to 93 percent but have fallen below 85 percent at some charter schools.The bill would need to be passed by the Council for a second time and then be signed by Mayor Muriel Bowser in order to become law.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

CNN: Cancer Researcher Killed During Her Regular Morning Run,"A successful cancer research scientist and mother-of-two was murdered and her body dumped in a creek while on her daily run in Texas this past weekend.Sarmistha Sen, 43, of Plano, was found dead near a creek at Legacy Drive and Marchman Way Saturday morning less than two hours after she went out on her regular run along the Chisholm Trail. A passerby found the victim’s body about 20 to 25 feet below the trail near the creek at around 7 a.m.Sen’s cause of death has not been released, but police confirmed it is being investigated as a homicide.Unintended Holistic Doctor Death Series: Over 90 DeadPolice said around the same time as her murder, a home was broken into nearby on the 3400 block of Michael Drive.  Plano police have named a 29-year-old burglary suspect Bakari Moncrief as a person of interest in the slaying.  Moncrief, an out-of-state resident allegedly visiting relatives in Plano, was arrested for a burglary Saturday morning at a property near where Sen’s body was discovered.Breaking: Florida holistic doctor killed in plane crashPlano Police Department public information officer David Tilley said no charges have been filed on Mr. Moncrief related to the murder, but he is considered a person of interest and is in the Collin County Jail on burglary charges. Moncrief is being held on an unusally high $1 million bond for the burglary charge. There were no records of Moncrief having a criminal history.It is not clear if Sen and Moncrief have any prior association, but a a CaringBridge site set up by the victim’s family said ‘a stranger brutally killed her for no apparent reason.’Police noted that the ‘close proximities and very close time frames’ of the cases have raised suspicions about Moncrief’s possible involvement in Sen’s death. Tilley said:‘Due to the fact that we had these close proximities and very close time frames of two offenses occurring, this individual became a person of interest in this murder investigation. Obviously, we’re wanting to collect evidence to either determine whether he is or he is not the person responsible for this.’Local residents rallied around Sen’s devastated family following the brutal attack, leaving dozens of pairs of running shoes in tribute to avid runner near the site of her death. Neighbors have also planned a memorial run in her honor in the local area for next Saturday morning.Sen grew up in Sindri, India, and moved to Bangalore to study before moving to Plano in 2004, according to a CaringBridge page set up by her family. She studied at UT Dallas and University of Birmingham, Alabama. She worked on cancer research for most of her career, most recently as a clinical research manager at U.T. Southwestern Medical Center. The page reads:Sarmistha lived a free and fearless life inspiring many with her infectious energy and carefree smile. Sarmistha was an avid runner, gardener and a great cook. She practiced healthy mindful living and she could cook extremely healthy food that tasted amazingly good. She was a trained singer of Indian classical music and loved to teach and perform music. She was passionate about cancer care and was a lifelong supporter of cancer research.She leaves behind her husband Arindam Roy, two young sons aged six and twelve, and a three-month old puppy named Milly.Our thoughts and prayers go out to her family and loved ones.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
"FOX: Gov. Newsom Orders California to Shut Down Indoor Activities, All Bar Operations","Citing escalating rates of people testing positive for the coronavirus and jumps in hospitalizations, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday ordered the closure of indoor operations at hair salons, gyms, houses of worship, personal-care services, malls, and non-critical office settings.The order affects all 30 counties on the state’s pandemic monitoring list — including San Diego, Los Angeles, Orange and Riverside counties.Newsom also ordered the statewide closure of indoor operations at restaurants, wineries, movie theaters, zoos, aquariums, family entertainment centers, and card rooms – and the full closure of all bars. Those restrictions were already in place in counties on the state’s monitoring list, but the new order extended them statewide.LA Times: Los Angeles County ‘With All Certainty’ Will Keep Stay-at-Home Orders in Place Through JulyNewsom reiterated that the state’s enactment of health-restrictions was being handled with a “dimmer switch,” meaning the severity of the orders can be adjusted upward or downward based on the latest virus statistics and “trendlines.”CBS: As Part of Quarantine Enforcement, California Officials Fill Skatepark with 74,000 Pounds of SandThe state has been seeing record numbers of infections in recent days, along with increasing hospitalizations. On Monday, Newsom said 6,485 were hospitalized across the state due to the coronavirus, with the seven-day rolling average of people testing positive for the virus at 7.7%. Newsom added:“This virus is not going away anytime soon. I hope all of us recognize that if we were still connected to some notion that somehow when it gets warm it’s going to go away or somehow it’s going to take summer months or weekends off, this virus has done neither. You’ve seen parts of the country with very hot … weather where you’re seeing an increase in positivity rates, an increase in hospitalizations and ICUs. Here in the state of California as we’re seeing triple-digit weather in many parts of our state, we’re still seeing an increase in the positivity rate, the community transmission. We’re seeing an increase in the spread of the virus.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0

"Massachusetts School District Gets Rid of Art, Music and PE Teachers for Coming School Year","Randolph Public School District, located in the Greater Boston, Massachusetts region, has cut their entire K-12 arts, music, and physical education (PE) programs and staff from their 2020-21 budget. In a district with only 250 teachers, at least 25 teachers and other workers received RIF (reduction in force) notices this week. While the elimination of entire essential departments is shocking, Randolph is not alone in suffering from budget cuts. With expected statewide cuts of up to 10 percent in Massachusetts, the nearby Public Schools of Brookline, a district with only 645 teachers, faces as many as 300 pink slips for this coming school year. The city of Brookline forecasts that their deficit will be $12.8 million, and will cut $6.3 million of this total from their education budget.Randolf citizens did not take the news lightly and took to social media to express their dismay. One person, worried about the pandemic, wrote:“The thought of cutting any teacher right now is insane to me, because you’re going to need every abled body in order to keep students safe in small groups… to cut the arts right now when all we’ve doing during quarantine is TURNING TO THEM?!”The Big Picture: Injured Kids, Society Costs—March 2020 UpdateFollowing the social media outcry, the World Socialist Web Site interviewed an art teacher who has worked in the Randolph school district for more than ten years, who provided valuable insights into the proceedings. Describing the Randolph school district, the art teacher, who requested to remain anonymous, said: “The district is mainly low to working class with a few pockets of higher income but a lot of low income housing options. Many single parent homes and parents working multiple low income jobs to make ends meet and still needing assistance.We are the most diverse district in the state. Over 40 languages are spoken in the homes across the town. We saw a huge increase in our Haitian population after the 2010 earthquake. The fact that we have a high ell [English language learner] population makes art, music and gym all the more important because they can be successful in these classes without knowing much of the language.”New Jersey Defeats Mandatory Vaccine BillMany feel the situation was handled clumsily at best. Multiple art teachers were informed individually that they were losing their jobs. After talking amongst each other, teachers quickly put the pieces together and reached out to administration. An emergency Zoom meeting was arranged by a principal that night, where he notified the art teachers of the cuts to their programs. After hearing rumors, Music and PE teachers received emails from HR that their programs were also getting cut. Lost classes are not the only threat facing students next year. The COVID-19 pandemic remains front and center and has already had a significant impact on Randolph’s students. The art teacher stated: “I have at least two students that reached out to me because they had the virus. I have at least one student that I know of that lost his mother. I have another that lost a grandmother and another that lost an uncle. Those are the ones that I know but I’m sure there have been more.”The state of students’ home lives is also having a huge impact on their ability to learn. The art teacher noted:“Many of our students have parents that work in healthcare, maintenance, food service and other essential jobs, and high schoolers have been tasked with caring for younger siblings and helping them with their schooling. Some have had to step up further because their parents had to be quarantined due to known exposure… I would say, in a good week, I hear from 60% of my students in some way (even if they aren’t completing the work, at least I heard from them).”‘Major distraction’: school dumps iPads, returns to paper textbooksWith the devastating effects of the pandemic, these students need assistance now more than ever, but the adults whose jobs it was to care for them will no longer be in their lives. On top of losing all arts, music, and PE teachers, elementary and middle school social workers and guidance counselors have also been stripped from the Randolph budget for next year, as well as some at the high school level. This will only intensify the unsettled state the students find themselves in. The art teacher noted that Randolph is no stranger to substandard educational facilities, adding:I think the lack of participation is more in part to losing the structure of school and losing the personal contacts and connections that in turn also hold kids accountable. Add to it the fear of the unknown—parents out of work, family members sick, parents are essential employees so there are no adults home to call them to task, older students caring for younger siblings, potential neglect or abuse that likely existed before but is exacerbated now, not enough food, and you realize kids have bigger fish to fry than whether or not they read a chapter, drew a picture, or learned more geometry.We have been on the chopping block at least three other times. We are behind other districts in what we have for technology for students. We have a transient student population. I may see a kid for freshman year and then never again. I may see them as a freshman, they leave and come back years later as a senior.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
An Out-of-Work Chef has Turned His Garage Into a Food Pantry that Defies Convention,"Catering chef Barney Corrigan was left jobless after the pandemic and quickly recognized the effect Covid-19 was having in his community in Westville, New Jersey. So he converted his home’s garage into a food pantry.Corrigan, 42, says he’s lucky to have a strong support system at home. His wife’s job has remained secure, which is keeping the family afloat. Still, as unemployment numbers continued to rise, Corrigan decided he could not just sit back and do nothing when so many people suddenly have no income to buy groceries.In April, with his mission in mind, Corrigan started building a small cabinet, filling it with dried goods and leaving it on his front lawn for people who needed help but were too embarrassed to ask for it. It didn’t take long for word of his project to spread on social media, and soon he had way too much food to fit in his “Little Pantry,” so he moved his operation into his garage and opened it up to the public every other Saturday. Now, Barney’s Place Food Pantry is serving more than 60 people biweekly. He said:“People are being forced to choose between paying their bills or feeding their kids. No one should have to make that decision. It’s sickening.”“When I heard car doors outside my house at three in the morning, that made me smile.”‘This has gone way past a shirt’ | Bullied Florida boy’s UT shirt spreads message of kindness throughout the worldCorrigan’s pantry is basically a convenience store. People can come and pick up whatever they need and there are no item limits. Thanks to his community’s generosity and strangers on the internet, who donate nonperishable items or money, he stocks fresh fruits and vegetables, milk, butter, and eggs in abundance.Corrigan has now formed a non-profit and hopes to expand his food pantry operations into a warehouse to serve people on a larger scale. He said:“I would love to make this a full-time thing. I love to cook so the goal is to eventually serve hot meals in addition to pantry items to anyone in need.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
Costco Limits Meat Purchases in U.S. as Supply Shortages Loom,"On Monday, Costco Wholesale Corp said it had restricted the number of beef, pork, and poultry products consumers can purchase, as grocery stores prepare for shortages of meat supplies due to coronavirus-induced supply interruptions.Costco is following in the steps of Kroger Co, which has put purchase limits on ground beef and fresh pork at some of its stores. The members-only facility said it would temporarily limit fresh poultry, beef, and pork purchases to a total of three items per Costco member.Many of the largest slaughterhouses in the U.S. closed over the last several weeks as COVID-19 spread broadly through meat processing facilities where large groups of employees often work shoulder to shoulder under challenging conditions.CNN: Almost 12 million pounds of Tyson chicken strips have been recalled because they might have metalStarting Monday, Costco will also require all customers to wear masks or face coverings to reduce the chances of transmission of the virus.John Tyson, chairman of the country’s largest meat processing company Tyson Foods Inc, said last week the food supply chain was “breaking” and millions of pounds of meat would vanish from grocery stores in the country.Later, President Trump ordered meat processing plants to stay open to protect food supplies, a move that drew backlash from some.",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
FOX: Costco Dumps Companies Using Monkey Labor. Here Is A List Of Companies That Don’t!,"Editors note: We understand that there are actually people who say they have no problems with monkeys in the wild being ripped from their mothers and forced to pick coconuts for such long hours that they often die on the job from heat exhaustion. Furthermore, they are physically chained to the trees so they cannot leave. Instead, we have provided a list of companies (with whom we have no affiliation) that use real human beings and give them a living fair trade wage. We are glad that one by one, these companies are refusing to carry products allegedly made by tortured monkeys and instead support companies that, shocker, hire an actual adult who needs a job. How does that sound? Pretty simple answer for us.Great news! Other retailers like Cost Plus, World Market, Walgreens, Giant Food, Food Lion, Stop & Shop and Hannaford also pulled coconut milk and other coconut products from shelves, as reported by USA Today.Did A Monkey Pick Your Coconuts?Unfortunately, it would appear from the news that Target, Walmart and possibly Kroger are still carrying the product. We already boycott Walmart, and we will be putting major pressure on them, if necessary, so they don’t carry milk made by tortured monkeys.  We are not monkeying around.Here are some brands that are not made using tortured monkeys. I do not get paid to list these brands nor do I get paid for my time to find them for you but I’m happy to do so. 🙂 🙂Thankfully these brands have made national news today for not using tortured trained monkeys.This is the ONLY Vitamin C I recommend out of the thousands I have received.

WaPo: Florida Sheriff Bans Deputies and Visitors From Wearing Masks,"Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods banned deputies and visitors from wearing masks at the sheriff’s office, according to reports.Woods said it’s a decision he’s been grappling with for several weeks. He believes the number of experts who say masks are good is about the same who say masks shouldn’t be worn, the Ocala Star-Banner reported.Woods said if visitors do not want to remove their masks, they will be asked to leave, wait in the lobby, or their cars, writing in an email to the paper:“This is no longer a debate nor is it up for discussion. Please keep in mind this entire pandemic is fluid and constantly changing the way things are done. However, my orders will be followed or my actions will be swift to address.”There are exceptions for deputies who work at the jail, courthouse, public schools, hospitals, and when coming into contact with people who may have COVID-19.Harvard Says Couples Should Wear Masks While Having SexWoods, meanwhile, told his deputies on Tuesday to stop wearing masks in most cases. While officers can still mask up in areas including the courthouse and county jail, they must immediately take off the face coverings afterward. Deputies working special events are also forbidden from wearing masks, Woods said, adding:“In light of the current events when it comes to the sentiment and/or hatred toward law enforcement in our country today, this is being done to ensure there is clear communication and for identification purposes of any individual walking into a lobby.”Broward County Order Says Masks Must Be Worn Inside HomesThe sheriff explained that working mask-free hasn’t led to a spike of infections in his 900-person department. He said:“Since the beginning of this pandemic the operation of this office has not changed and no wearing of masks has been put in place.”",2,https://www.healthnutnews.com,0
